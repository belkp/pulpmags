by Arthur Waley The Harper of Chao The singers have hushed their notes of clear songThe red sleeves of the dancers are motionlessHugging his lutethe old harper of Chao Rocks and sways as he touches the five chordsThe loud notes swell and scatter abroad Sasa like wind blowing the rainThe soft notes dying almost to nothing Ch iehch ieh like the voice of ghosts talkingNow as glad as the magpie s lucky songAgain bitter as the gibbon s ominous cryHis ten fingers have no fixed noteUp and downkungchihandyuAnd those who sit and listen to the tune he plays Of soul and body lose the masteryAnd those who pass that way as he plays the tune Suddenly stop and cannot raise their feetAlasalas that the ears of common men Should love the modern and not love the oldThus it is that the harp in the green

bedIn the distance I see red wheeled coaches driving from the town gateThey have taken the troublethese civil people to meet their new PrefectAfter Getting DrunkBecoming Sober in the Night Our party scattered at yellow dusk and I came home to bedI woke at midnight and went for a walkleaning heavily on a friendAs I lay on my pillow my vinous complexionsoothed by sleepgrew soberIn front of the tower the ocean moonaccompanying the tidehad risenThe swallowsabout to return to the beamswent back to roost againThe candle at my windowjust going outsuddenly revived its lightAll the time till dawn camestill my thoughts were muddiedAnd in my ears something sounded like the music of flutes and stringsLast Poem They have put my bed beside this unpainted screenThey have shifted my stove in front of the blue curtainI listen to my grandchildren reading to me from a bookI watch the servants heating up the soupI move my pencilanswering the poems of friendsI feel in my pockets and pull out the medicine moneyWhen this superintendance of trifling affairs is done I lie back on my pillows and sleep with my face to the South The Little Review CANTELMAN S SPRING MATE Wyndham Lewis CANTELMAN walked in the strenuous fieldssteam rising from them as though from an exertiondissecting the daisies specked in the small woodthe primroses on the banksthe marshy lakesand all God s creaturesThe heat of a heavy premature Summer was cooking the little narrow belt of earth aircausing everything innocently to burst its skinbask abjectly and profoundlyEverything was enchanted with itself and with everything elseThe horses considered the mares immensely appetising masses of quivering shiny fleshwas there not something ofje ne sais quoiabout a marethat no other beast s better half possessedThe birds with their little gnarled feetand beaks made for fishing worms out of the mouldor the riverwould have considered Shelley s references to the skylark or any other poet s paeans to their species as lamentably inadequate to describe the beauty of birdsThe female birdfor her particular partreflected thatin spite of the ineptitude of her sweetheart s latest songwhich he insisted on deafening her withnever seemed to tire ofand was so persuaded that she liked as much as he did himselfand although outwardly she remained strictly critical and viciousthat all the same and neverthelesschockchockpeeppeephe was a fluffy object from which certain satisfaction could be derivedAnd both the male and the female reflected together as they stood a foot or so apart looking at each other with one eyeand at the landscape with the otherthat of all nourishment the red earthworm was the juiciest and sweetestThe sowas she watched her hogwith his splenetic energyand guttural articulationa sound between content and complaintnot noticing the untidy habits of both of themgave a sharp grunt of sex hungerand jerked rapidly towards himThe only jarring note in this vast mutual admiration society was the fact that many of its members showed their fondness for their neighbour in an embarrassing waythat is they killed and ate themBut the weaker were so used to dying violent deaths and being eaten that they worried very little about it The West was gushing up a harmless volcano of fireobviously intended as an immense dreamy nightcapCantleman in the midst of his cogitation on surrounding lifesurprised his faithless and unfriendly brain in the act of turning The Little Review over an object which humiliated his meditationHe found that he was wondering whether at his return through the village lying between him and the Camphe would see the girl he had passed there three hours bforeAt that time he had not begun his philosophizingand without interference from consciencehe had noticed the redness of her cheeksthe animal fulness of the childbearing hipswith an eye as innocent as the bird or the beastHe laughed without shame or pleasurelit his pipe and turned back towards the villageHis fieldboots were covered with dusthis head was wet with perspiration and he carried his capin unmilitary fashionin his handIn a week he was leaving for the Frontfor the first timeSo his thoughts and sensations all hadas a philosophic backgroundthe prospect of deathThe Infantryand his commissionimplied death or mutilation unless he were very luckyHe had not a high opinion of his luckHe was pretty miserable at the thoughtin a deliberateunemotional wayBut as he realised this he again laugheda similiar sound to that that the girl had causedFor what was he unhappy aboutHe wanted to remain amongst his fellow insects and beastswhich were so beautifuldid he thenWell wellOn the other handwho was it that told him to do anything elseAfter allsupposing the values they attached to each other ofbeautifulinterestingdivine were unjustified in many cases on cooler observation nevertheless birds were more beautiful than pigsand if pigs were absurd and uglyrather than handsomeand possibly chivalrousas they imagined themselvesthen equally the odour of the violet was pleasantand there was nothing offensive about most treesThe newspapers were the things that stank most on earthand human beings anywhere were the most ugly and offensive of the brutes because of the confusion caused by their consciousnessHad it not been for that unmaterial gift that some bungling or wild hand had bestowedour sisters and brothers would be no worse than dogs and sheepThat they could not reconcile their little meagre stream of sublimity with the needs of animal life should not be railed atWell thenshould not the sad human amalgamall it didall it willedall it demandedbe thrown overfor the fake and confusion that it wasand should not such as possessed a greater quantity of that wine of reasonretiremetaphoricallyto the wildernessand sit forever in a formal and gentle elationrefusing to be disturbed Should such allow himself to be disturbed by the quarrels of jewsthe desperate perplexitiesresulting in desperate dice throwsof politiciansthe crack jaw and unreasoning tumultOn the other handCantleman had a little more humanas well as a little more divinethan those usually on his left and rightand he had hadnot so long agoconspicuous hopes that such a conjuncture might produce a new human chemistryBut he must repudiate the human entirelyif that were to be brought offHis present occupationthe trampling boots upon his feetthe belt that crossed his back and breastwas his sacrificehis compliment tothe animalHe then began dissecting his laughcomparing it to the pig s grunt and the bird s coughHe laughed again several times in order to listen to itAt the village he met the girlthis time with a second girlHe stared at herin such a funny waythat she laughedHe once more laughedthe same sound as beforeand bid her good eveningShe immediately became civilEnquiries about the villageand the best way back to camp across the marshput in as nimble and at the same time rustic a form as he could contrivelay the first tentative brick of what might become the dwelling of a frienda sweethearta ghostanything in the absurd worldHe asked her to come and show him a short cut she had indicated I couldn tMy mother s waiting for me in a rush of expostulation and semi affected alarmHowevershe concludedin a minute or twothat she couldHe wished that she had been some Anne Garlandthe lady whose lips were always flying open like a door with a defective latchHe had made Anne s acquaintance under distressing circumstancesOn his arrival at Gideon brookthe mighty brand new camp on the edge of the marshhe found that his colleague in charge of the advance party had got him a bed space in a room with four officers of another regimentIt had seemed impossible that there were any duller men than those in the mess of his particular battalionbut it was a dullness he had become accustomed toHe saw his four new companions with a sinking of the heartand steady gnawing anger at such concentration of furious foolishnessCantleman did not know their namesand he hated them in order as followsAhe hated because he found him a sturdyshortish young man with a bull like stoop and energetic rush in his walkwith flat feet spread out to left to rightand slightly bowed legsThis physique was enhanced by his leggingsand not improvedthough hiddenin his slacksHe had a swarthy and vivacious facewith a sort of semitic cunning and insolence painted on itHis cheeks had a broad carmine flush on general sallownessThe mind painted on this face for the perusal of whoever had the art of such letteringwas as vulgar stuffin Cantleman s judgementas could be foundTo see this face constantly was like hearing perpetually a cheap and foolish musicAwas an officerbut naturally not a gentlemanBhe dislikedbecausebeing lean and fresh colouredwith glasseshe stankto Cantleman s peculiar noseof Jack LondonSummer Numbers of magazinesbad flabby Suburban Tennisflabby clerkship in inertthough still prosperouscity officesHe brought a demoralizing dullness into the room with himwith a brisk punctiliousnessseveral inches higher from the ground than AChe resented for the sullen stupidity with which he moved aboutthe fat having settled at the bottom of his cheeksand pulled the corners of his mouth downfrom sheer stagnationHis accent dragged the listener through the larger slums of Scotlandharrowing him with the bestial cheerlessness of morose religion and povertyThe man was certainlyfrom every point of viewsocial perstigecharacterintelligencefar less suited to hold a commission than most of the privates in his platoonDreproduced the characteristics of the other threein different qantitieshis only personal contribution being a senile sing song voicefrom the Northand a blond beamor partially toothless grinfor a faceThis was the society into the midst of which Cantleman had been dropped on his arrival at Gideon brookten days previous to thisThey had all looked up for it was always allthey having the inseparability of their kindwith friendly welcomeas brother officers shouldHe avoided their eyesand sat amongst them for a few daysreading the Trumpet Majorbelonging to BHe had even seemed to snatch Hardy away from Bas though Bhad no business to possess such booksThen they avoided his eye as though an animal disguised as an officer and gentleman like themselves had got into their roomfor whomthereinthe Trumpet Major and nothing else exercised fascinationHe came among them suddenlyand not appearing to see themsettled down into a morbid intercourse with a romantic abstractionThe Trumpet Majorit is truewas a soldierthat is why he was thereBut he was an imaginary oneand imbedded in the passionate affairs of the village of a mock countyand distant timeCantelman bit the flesh at the side of his thumbsas he surveyed the Yeomanry Cavalry revelling in the absent farmer s houseand The Little Review the infantile Farnese Herculeswith the boastfulness of the Redexplaining to his military companions the condescensions of his infatuationAnne Garland stood in the moonlightand Loveday hesitated to reveal his rivalweighing a rough chivalry against self interestCantelman eventually decamped with the Trumpet Majortaking him across to Havreand Bnever saw his book againCantelman had also tried to take a book away from A a book incompatible with A s vulgar physique But Ahad snatched it backand mounted guard surlily and cunningly over itIn his present rustic encounterthenhe was influenced in his feelings towards his first shepherdess by memories of Wessex heroinesand the something more that being the daughter of a landscape painter would giveAnneimbued with the delicacy of the Millfilled his mind to the injury of this crude marsh plantBut he had his programmeSince he was forced backby his logic and bodyamong the madness of natural thingshe would live up to his partThe young woman hador had given herselfthe unlikely name of StellaIn the narrow road where they got away from the villageCantelman put his arm around Stella s waist and immediately experienced all the sensations that he had been divining in the creatures around himthe horsethe bird and the pigThe way in which Stella s hips stood outthe solid blood heated expanse on which his hand layhad the amplitude and flatness of a mareHer Hps had at once no practical significancebut only the aesthetic blandishment of a bull like flowerWith the gesture of a fabulous Faust he drew her against himand kissed her with a crafty gentlenessCantelman turned up that evening in his quarters in a state of baffling good humourHe took up the Trumpet Major and was soon surrounded by the breathing and scratching of his roommatesreading and writingHe chuckled somewhere where Hardy was funnyAt this human noise the others fixed their eyes on him in sour alarmHe gave anotherthis time gratuitouschuckleThey returned with disgust at his habitshis peculiarityto what he considered their maid servant s fiction and correspondenceOh Christwhat abysmsOh Christwhat abysmsCantelman shook noisily in the wicker chair like a dog or a fly blown old gentlemanOnce more on the following evening he was out in the fieldsand once more his thoughts were engaged in recapitulationsThe miraculous camouflage of Nature did not deceive this observerHe saw everywhere the gun pits and thenests of death Each The Little Review puff of green leaves he knew was in some way as harmful as the burst of a shellDecay and ruinsit is truewere soon covered upbut there was yet that paralleland the sight of things smashed and corruptionIn the factory town ten miles away to the rightwhose smoke could be seenlife was just as dangerous for the poorand as uncomfortableas for the soldier in his trenchThe hypocricy of Nature and the hypocrisy of War were the sameThe only safety in life was for the man with the soft jobBut that fellow was not conforming to life s conditionsHe was life s paid manand had the mark of the sneakHe was making too much of lifeand too much out of itHeCantelmandid not want to owe anything to lifeor enter into league or understanding with herThe thing was either to go out of existenceorfailing thatremain in it unreconciledindifferent to Nature s threatconsorting openly with her enemiesmaking a war within her war upon her servantsIn shortthe spectacle of the handsome English spring produced nothing but ideas of defiance in Cantleman s mindAs to Stellashe was a sort of WhizbangWith a treachery worthy of a HunNature tempted him towards herHe was drugged with delicious appetitesVery wellHe would hoist the unseen power with his own petardHe would throw back Stella where she was discharged fromif it were allowablenowto change her into a bombfirst having relieved himself of this humiliating gnawing and yearning in his bloodAs to Stellaconsidered as an unconscious agentall women were contaminated with Nature s hostile power and might be treated as spies or enemiesThe only time they could be trustedor were likely to stand up to Nature and show their teethwas as mothersSo he approached Stella with as much falsity as he could masterAt their third meeting he brought her a ringHer melting gratitude was immediately ligotted with long armsfull of the contradictory and offending fire of the springOn the warm earth consent flowed up into her body from all the veins of the landscapeThe nightingale sang ceaselessly in the small wood at the top of the field where they layHe grinned up towards itand once more turned to the devouring of his mateHe felt that he was raiding the bowels of Naturenot fecundating the Aspasias of our flimsy fleshor assuagingor competing withthe nightingale Cantelman was proud that he could remain deliberate and aloofand gaze bravelylike a minute insectup at the immense and melancholy nightwith all its mad nightingalespiously folded small brown 14 The Little Review wings in a million nestsnight working starsand misty useless watchmenThey got up at lastshe went furtively back to her homeCantelman on his way to camp had a smile of severe satisfaction on his faceIt did not occur to him that his action might be supremeiy unimportant as far as Stella was concernedHe had not even asked himself ifhad he not been there that nightsomeone else might or might not have been there in his placeHe was also convinced that the laurels were hisand that Nature had come off badlyHe was still convinced of this when he received six weeks afterwardsin Francea long appeal from Stellatelling him that she was going to have a childShe received no answer to that nor any subsequent letterThey came to Cantelman with great regularity in the trencheshe read them all through from beginning to endwithout comment of any sortAnd when he beat a German s brains outit was with the same impartial malignity that he had displayed in the English night with his Spring mateOnly he considered there too that he was in some way outwitting Naturehe had no adequate realization of the extent to whichevidentlythe death of a Hun was to the advantage of the animal worldIMAGINARY LETTERS

irreconcilable disagreement between her and the editorial body concerning a war policyThere are intelligent peopleI hearwho are prepared to defend her actionBut there is no conceivably intelligent defense for such an actionIt is simply another case of the proverbial and astounding Americannerve in the case of a magazine of the Arts it is a truly collossal nerveHow dare MrsRankine or any other patron take the responsibility of the several thousand readers who subscribed to The Seven Arts because they wished to read what its editors had to sayWhether they agreed or not with what was said has nothing to do with itIt is even conceivable that some of them may have enjoyed reading what they did not agree withor that some of themghastly but possibleapproved of the Seven Arts attitude toward the warOnly one thing is certainthat none of those subscribers read the magazine because of anything MrsRankine contributed to its pagesBut a certain type of American mind is capable of anythingThis

damn foolpossibly because of his devotion to literature and who gave the editorship into other handsComparison of current numbers of The English Review with the first numbers issued from 84 Holland Park Avenuewill give any thinking person all the data he wants in deciding between the folly of Hueffer and the folly of manufacturingpolitical hebrewsIn factif a crime against literature could bring any shame upon that class of personthis family would go into penitencewhich needless to say they will notBut the careful historian of literature will record and remember their shameThe files of the review being stored in the British Museumthe data will continue availableThere will be no faking the recordsThe Little Review is now the first effort to do comparitively what The English Review did during its first year and a halfthat isto maintain the rights and position of literatureI do not say in contempt of the publicbut in spite of the curious system of trade and traders which has grown up with the purpose or result of interposing itself between literature and the publicWe act in spite of the public s utter impotence to get good literature for itselfand in despite of the efforts of thetradeto satiate the public with a substituteto still their appetite for literature by providing themat a cheaper rate and more convenientlywith a swallowable substituteWhereanent a very successful journalist has said to meWeiewe journalistsare like mediumsPeople go to a spiritist séance and hear what they want to hearIt is the same with a leading articlewe write so that the reader will find what he wants to findThat is the root of the matterthere is good journalism and bad journalismand journalism thatlookslikeliteratureand literature etc But the root of the difference is that in journalism the reader finds what he is looking forwhat hethe reader wantswhereas 22 The Little Review in literature he must find at least a part of what the author intendedThat is whythe first impression of a work of geniusisnearly always disagreeable at least to theaverage man The public loathe the violence done to their self conceit whenever an author conveys to them an idea that is hisnot their ownThis difference is lasting and profoundEven in the vaguest of poetryor the vaguest musicwhere in a sense the receiver mayor mustmake half the beauty he is to receivethere is always something of the author or composer which must be transmittedIn journalismor thebad artwhich is but journalism thinly disguisedthere is no such strain on the publicI am now at the end of my spaceOf Remy de Gourmont s feeling toward such a magazine as we are now making I will write in the December numberSTYLE AND AMERICAN LITERATURE Maxwell Bodenheim AMERICAN literature is divided into three plaintive continentsclear cold psychological datasentimental unbeautiful lyingand social propagandaThe first is a photographthe seconda pretty vaseand the thirda decorated sledge hammerThe American Writer earnestly strives to accomplish somethinghe starts out with a fixed and lofty objective which ranges from aportrayal of the soul of the massesand an exposure of the iniquities of the present social systemtoan unfolding of the poetry that lies in simple people He seizes upon ideas that have been current coin in Europe for the past centurywrites them much worse than they were originally writtenand is hailed as a geniusHis characters are marvels of realism stop any milkman on the corner and he will talk exactly as Dreiser s Witla talksand act just as ordinary human beings in theArcadia Residence Hotelor Winklehofer s Alley would actHe writes on the theory that human beings lack eyes and cannot see the conditions about thmbut must be carefully told in lengths of four hundred pages that a grafting politician is looting a citythat a man can immerse himself in moneymaking and lose his soulthat working people are unjustly treatedthat women are asserting their economic independenceand that society people drink and have gossamer moralsThe Little Review If he is striving to educate people who are inclined to argue pro and con about these subtle mattershe could become a far more effective elementary teacher by compiling with his fellow writers an encyclopedia which could be printed in serial formor by having his work made into text books for schools and collegesSince his aim is really the spreading of information about human beingsdescriptive and phsycologicalhis prose style is always simplestrong and clearas the phrase goesand he leaves imagination and beautiful word mosaics to weak kneed poetswho believe in making lyricalelaborate lies about human beings and life in a desperate effort to escape the simplestrong and clear nightmares of conditions and sights about themBut what am I sayingModern American poets have also become realistic in a different wayIt has become a rigid shiboleth among American poets of the present daythat writing about a rose or a sunset inevitably proves that a man is a minor poetand that steam cranesshoe string peddlarsfarm handsthe Panama Canalice wagon drivers and machinists are the only fit subjects for a spirited poetAnd so the most sincere of the present landslide of American poets write about these subjects in a bold and true mannerproviding a sort of unadorned kindergarten which your soul is supposed to attendAnd the least sincere among them sing of realistic sightsbut seem a little ashamed of their contenthiding it with picture puzzle styleswhich you piece together only to discover that they lead to very simple meaningsThen there is another class of contemporary American poetswho strive hard to achieve subtle meaningsnot realizing that only literary style is subtleand that meanings are all on about the same intangible levelThese poets write poems that seem experiments in differential calculusuntil you suddenly discover that they are in reality many simple concepts mixed in a temporarily baffling fashionIn their plaintive search for originality of thought and emotion American writers achieve only twisted echoes of old world literaturefor the simple reason that outside of scientific research and pure philosophy ideas are eunuchs drained by centuriesand dressed in variations of old costumesAny modern writer with a little research can discover that some old Hindoo or Chinaman or European said exactly what he is sayingand in a far more imaginative and beautiful wayBut literary style alone remains a comparatively untouched regionbecause the great majority of writerssince the beginning of the Christian erahave always been clutched by some great burning message which they fancied the world needed or by some new situation in which human beings would act differently than they ever before actedor by some important moral that required hundreds of pages for illustrationWhen they abandoned these important kingships it was either to lose themselves in aimless tearsto become vaguely exuberantor to shrewdly analyze the mob desires of their days and settle down to careful entertainingIn all of these aimsliterary style became chief cook and bottle washer an obedient servantwho was thoroughly whipped if he ever became rebelliousand achieved moments of sheer word beautywhich failed to illuminate the aim of the writeror which momentarily crystalized the writer s formless rhapsodiesTherefore absolutely new and beautiful word designs are possiblesince words aloneunconnected with great messages or sentimental self portrayalshave been practically ignored by writers of the Christian EraWhen American writers become thoroughly decandentand are not ashamed to frolic ardently with wordswriting in a passionate surge in which imagination becomes a tipsy priestmarrying words and meaningand waltzing arm in arm down the road with thembeauty in American literature will have its inceptionOne critic claims that this situation is impossiblebecause of the complacent democracy of this countryin which every country bumpkin and rich man with a large library considers himself an infallible judge of literary valuesamong other questions of artBecause of this he believes that only those writers who deal in elementary social instruction or sentimental commonplacescan secure a hearingBut even if a small aristocracy were in control of the literary situation herebeautiful books would have to be distributed free of charge and would gain very little in circulationbecause the average American is an unmellowed self confident nondescript who considers culture to be for sale at bargain pricesEach European country has had centuries in which to condense into that quiet sophistication which demands in fiction and poetry other intangible food than economic sermons or descriptions of the surface facts of its daily lifeor sentimental ecstasieswhile the American is still a little growing boyinterested only in literary marble gamesThe American political situation has nothing to do with this if we changed to a kingdom or an economic Utopia tomorrow the American citizen would still purchase tons of Governeur Morris and Edna Ferberand would still wistfully and wearily try to wade through occasional volumes from writers who have been recommended to him ashighbrowsThe Little Review BARBARA ROSCORLA S CHILD A Play in One Act

years and found nothingHe has tantalized me with the feeling that there must be some originality to explain if not to justify at least his preposterous nameAnd now in The Little Review his satiric poem L Homme Moyen Sensuel really enchants methere are rhymes in it worthy of ByronThatinfant tick who s now the editor of The Atlanticis as good as the couplet on HVan DykeWhen he praisesHenry Jamesfor instance he s not so convincingStill I enjoyed the whole thing immensely and thank you for the treatDry Bones HR TrinidadColoradoI enclose a subscription to The Little ReviewNot because it is worth itYou know it is notBut because of my appreciation of the magazine when it first heralded the dawn of a new eraI knew the body and souof it then and thought it the most significantyouthful and vigorous magazine in AmericaWhen your last number reached me I exclaimedHow the mighty have fallen It attempts to speakbut the voice is too feebleThrough its pages I find only bonesdry bonessans lifesans youthsans energyBut as long as you are at the helm of the new adventure I have faith in The Little ReviewI know it will emerge triumphantlyAlienation Otis APooleShidzuokaJapanSometimes I think you needlessly alienate the support of numbers of subscriberspossessed of rudimentary ambitions toward a better appreciation of Art in its various formsby too roughly snubbing and scoffing at thembecause they do not immediately swallow all the newstuffcreated in defiance of convention and precedentwithout a grimace of dislike or a rational lack of faith in its worthwhileness as expressive of the present era s conception of truth and beauty in all that pertains to life as it is or might bebutthe Gods give my donkey wings if herewith isn t an extension of my subscription to The Little Review in spite of itArt and the War JKCBostonThe idea of The Little Review appealed to me immensely and I subscribed because I wanted to be friendsAltogether I like itThe Little Review especially your article on Isadora DuncanEzra Pound s stuffand the Chinese poemsAlso the book reviewswhichto use a phrase of Leon Daudetare notmere vague publicitylike most of them these daysBut I was very much surprised by the lack of appreciation and understanding shown by your comments on Le Feu by Henri Barbussebut decided that you had probably never read that great bookWhat distresses mehoweveris in the August numberSome one from Kansas writes congratulating you for not printing anything aboutthis blasted war That you do not I have no quarrel withIt is a reliefBut when in a superior way you say that you do not consider the waran interesting or legitimate subject for ArtI cannot agreeThe existence of Art and all its traditions depends on the outcome of the warwhich is fundamentally a war of the ideal of these traditions against the ideal of powerRead Le Genie Latinby Gugliumo Ferrero if you have not already done soThink of the beautiful noble things inspired by the war in Francefor exampleamong manythe articles of Barres in L Echo de Paris and the poems of Paul ClaudelAfter your statementto compare these writings with some that you have printed is quite laughableAnd then Art needs something noble in itand anything where noble self sacrifice occurs daily is a fit subject for it I don t understand what you mean by my lack of appreciation of Le FeuThe object of MBarbusse was to show that the immense horror of war is not to be used for any object except for the destruction of that horrorAs for the noble elements of daily self sacrificeetc etc he says It would be a crime to show the nobler aspects of wareven if there were any As for Art needing something noble in itArt doesn t need anythingArt is the nobilityAnd of course I thought we needn t argue any longer about the vice of self sacrificeBut you have clearly misunderstood what was meant by the war not being a legitimate subject for ArtWe will argue it fully in the next issueAlso I have a long letter from Stephane Boecklin about the artist s relation to the warwhich will be printed in the November number MCA The Little Review ART AND CRITICISM IN AMERICAfrom the New York PressTribune Edith Wharton s
