bitter and bright And full of hidden recesses Of love and light  O world what use would there be to me Of power beyond power To change or establish new balance To build or deflower  O world what use would there be Had I the Creator s fire I could not build you nearer To my heart s desire   HUMORESQUE  To some the fat gods Give money To some love  But the gods have given me Money and love  Not too much money Nor quite enough love  To some the fat gods Give money To some love  TWO VOICES  There is a country full of wine And liquor of the sun Where sap is running all the year And spring is never done Where all is good as it is fair And love and will are one Old age may never come there But ever in to day The people talk as in a dream And laugh slow time away   Two Voices  But would you stay as now you are Or as a year ago Oh not as then for then how small The wisdom we did owe Or if forever as to day How little we could know  Then welcome age and fear not sorrow To day s no better than to morrow Or yesterday that flies By the low light in your eyes By the love that in me lies I know we grow more lovely Growing wise  LOVE ME AT LAST Love me at last or if you will not Leave me Hard words could never as these half words Grieve me Love me at last or leave me  Love me at last or let the last word uttered Be but your own Love me or leave me as a cloud a vapor Or a bird flown Love me at last I am but sliding water Over a stone  Alice Corbin   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  POEMS  GRIEF  The darkness steals the forms of all the queens But oh the palms of her two black hands are red It is Death I fear so much it is not the dead Not this gray book but the red and bloody scenes  The lamps are white like snowdrops in the grass The town is like a churchyard all so still And gray now night is here nor will Another torn red sunset come to pass  And so I sit and turn the book of gray Feeling the shadows like a blind man reading All fearful lest I find some next word bleeding Nay take my painted missal book away  MEMORIES  Oh if I could have put you in my heart  If but I could have wrapped you in myself  How glad I should have been And now the chart Of your lost face unrolls itself to me  Or dead or still or grieved or glad or hurt   Memories  And oh that you had never never been Some of your selves my love I would that some Of your several faces I had never seen For still the night through will they come and go One after each and show me what they mean  And oh my love as I rock for you tonight And have not any longer any hope Of sweeping out old sorrows with the bright Sure love that could have helped you through the fight I own that some of me is dead tonight  WEARINESS  Why does the thin gray strand Floating up from the forgotten Cigarette between my fingers Why does it trouble me  Ah you will understand When I carried my mother downstairs A few times only at the beginning Of her soft foot malady  I should find for a reprimand To my gayety a long gray hair On the breast of my coat and I let it float Gray strand towards the dark chimney   SERVICE OF ALL THE DEAD  Between the avenue of cypresses All in their scarlet capes and surplices Of linen go the chaunting choristers The priests in gold and black the villagers  And all along the path to the cemetery The round dark heads of men crowd silently And black scarfed faces of women folk wistfully Watch at the banner of death and the mystery  And at the foot of a grave a father stands With sunken head and forgotten folded hands And at the foot of a grave a mother kneels With pale shut face nor neither hears nor feels  The coming of the chaunting choristers Between the avenue of cypresses The silence of the many villagers The candle flames beside the surplices   Poems  DON JUAN  It is Isis the mystery Must be in love with me  Here this round ball of earth Where all the mountains sit Solemn in groups And the bright rivers flit Round them for girth  Here the trees and troops Darken the shining grass And many bright people pass Like plunder from heaven Many bright people pass Plundered from heaven  But what of the mistresses  What the beloved seven They were but witnesses  I was just driven  Where is there peace for me It is Isis the mystery Must be in love with me   SONG  Love has crept into her sealed heart As a field bee black and amber Breaks from the winter cell to clamber Up the warm grass where the sunbeams start  Love has crept into her summery eyes And a glint of colored sunshine brings Such as his along the folded wings Of the bee before he flies  But I with my ruffling impatient breath Have loosened the wings of the wild young sprite He has opened them out in a reeling flight And down her words he hasteneth  Love flies delighted in her voice The hum of his glittering drunken wings Sets quivering with music the little things That she says and her simple words rejoice  D H Lawrence   POEMS  MY SORROW  My sorrow that I am not by the little dun By the lake of the starlings at Rosses under the hill And the larks there singing over the fields of dew Or evening there and the sedges still For plain I see now the length of the yellow sand And Lissadell far off and its leafy ways And the holy mountain whose mighty heart Gathers into it all the colored days My sorrow that I am not by the little dun By the lake of the starlings at evening when all is still And still in whispering sedges the herons stand Tis there I would nestle at rest till the quivering moon Uprose in the golden quiet over the hill  SPLENDID AND TERRIBLE  Splendid and terrible your love The searing pinions of its flight Flamed but a moment s space above The place where ancient memories keep Their quiet and the dreaming deep Moved inly with a troubled light And that old passion woke and stirred Out of its sleep   Splendid and terrible your love I hold it to me like a flame I hold it like a flame above The empty anguish of my breast There let it stay there let it rest Deep in the heart whereto it came Of old as some wind wearied bird Drops to its nest  THE OTHERS  From our hidden places By a secret path We come in the moonlight To the side of the green rath  There the night through We take our pleasure Dancing to such a measure As earth never knew  To dance and lilt And song without a name So sweetly chanted Twould put a bird to shame   The Others  And many a maiden Is there of mortal birth Her young eyes laden With dreams of earth  Music so piercing wild And forest sweet would bring Silence on blackbirds singing Their best in the ear of spring  And many a youth entranced Moves slow in the dreamy round His brave lost feet enchanted With the rhythm of faery sound  Oh many a thrush and blackbird Would fall to the dewy ground And pine away in silence For envy of such a sound  So the night through In our sad pleasure We dance to many a measure That earth never knew  Seumas O Sullivan   CHRISTMAS AT SAINT LUKE S HOSPITAL  Here in this house of mystery and death  This challenge flung at God who has set pain  And heart ache and slow torture in his world  Dawns Christmas Day  We have outwatched the night Vainly in tight lipped silence we have wrung From creeping death a piteous hour or two Now it is day The long white corridors Naked and empty in the winds of dawn Stir in the light and grow alive again With flitting nurses and internes in white Who talk and laugh together as they must  They wish us Merry Christmas and we try To cover our soul s nakedness and smile And as we wait dumb with long agony A jingling of loud bells breaks the white calm Absurdly A man enters dressed in red Tricked out in furs white bearded for the saint Of rapturous childhood and his deep eyes wear A haunting wistful mask of gaiety He laughs and capers jingles bells and jokes With mad abandon speaks a word to us A frothy nothing then still jingling goes And the white calm returns   Christmas at Saint Luke s Hospital  A tiny flame Set in the vastness of the night he is A thin small sound that impishly disturbs The silence of the spheres a childish joy Futile and beautiful the soul of man That cries to heaven Bring on your thunderbolts I still defy   He passes and we wrap the human warmth  About our shivering souls and turn us back  To face the darkness of another day  Eunice Tietjens   CHARWOMEN  They might be the grim Parcae of old Greece The three worn women whom I oft behold Pass my warm window in the biting cold Across the square decent with falling fleece Sometimes as now when the arc lights increase The wrinkled faces

the open seeking God And came where men had builded them a church with windows of multi colored glass to balk the sunlight  And there had they fashioned them an altar of mysterious recesses and many steps of gradations and curtained sanctities wherein dwelt silence and a sense of fear  I looked upon a cross of beaten gold and candles flaming dully through the dark And all the corners in the church were dim and all the aisles mysterious with strange shadows A priest held high a crucifix and my soul seemed listening to the voice of his soul God is in there We ve shut Him up He s back of that veil See how the candles blink It s God s breath makes them  do that Here s our creed We ve shut God up in that too Say it over and over and you ll come to believe it Then shall you save your soul alive Then shall you creep on your knees into the marble chancel  and you may see a corner of the veil that covers the  Sanctus Sanctissimus  The veil hides the face of God it screens the awful majesty of the Most High That s as near as you may hope to come to seeing God   You would be stricken blind if you were to look upon Him But He s in there We ve shut Him up  And all the while God and I stood outside in His blessed sunlight and laughed  Francis Howard Williams   LYRICS  AFTER THE MARTYRDOM  They threw a stone you threw a stone I threw a stone that day Although their sharpness bruised his flesh He had no word to say  But for the moan he did not make To day I make my moan And for the stone I threw at him  My heart must bear a stone  LAMENT  Lady your heart has turned to dust Your wail is taken by the sea The wind is knocking at my heart And will not let me be  Your moaning smites me in my dreams And I must sorrow till I die And I shall rove and I shall weep Till in the

Said Carry it home So I put it into a sack And carried it home on my back  I lit the lantern of the sun And stole the blue cloth of the sky A cover for my little one I made his crib Is that his cry

day drowses on the western steep The toiler faints along the marge of sleep Within the sunset press incarnadine The sun a peasant tramples out his wine  Ah scattered gold rests on the twilight streams The poppy opes her scarlet purse of dreams Night with the sickle moon engarners wheat And binds the sheaves of stars beneath her feet  Rest weary heart and every flight worn bird The brooklet of the meadow lies unstirred Sleep every soul against a comrade breast God grant you peace and guard you in your rest  Scharmel Iris   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE TREASURE DRAWER  Often in memory to a drawer I turn Wherein my mother kept such queer strange things For which with a child s fancy I would yearn An ivory fan emerald and opal rings Attar of roses in a bottle tall With traceries of Arabesque design A pair of velvet slippers dainty small I doubted Cinderella s were so fine Made up the treasures and a mother o pearl And lacquer box tight locked of which the key Had long been lost since she was quite a girl She said Years passed and then the mystery Was solved three little feathers golden bright Lay side by side labelled in childish hand As Piccadilly s Feathers How my sight Grew dim for I at last could understand The loneliness a pet canary filled Ah I could wish at times those memories Like Piccadilly s songs might all be stilled Or locked in some pearl casket from these eyes  Antoinette De Coursey Patterson   LONDON NIGHT  In the Strand Desperately and disdainfully showed his wares Stupid things laces studs I bought his look and this verse  Introduction  Still

beauty of that ideal of human brother  hood which for two thousand years the  blundering quarrelling world absorbed in immediate needs and passions has nevertheless not quite been able to forget Again and again through these twenty centuries the star in the east has been obscured the promise of peace on earth has been outraged the blossoming fields have been strewn with dead in the name of this or that flag or cause But the ideal persists toward its ultimate fulfilment which may perhaps be hastened by the coldness the devilish ingenuity the anachronistic autocracy of modern war  Illusion rules the world we are still led by mediaeval dreamers nay by Caesar Alexander Sesostris The feudal system the world old divine right of kings may be making its last stand at the Marne and the Yser The new illusions must have time to grow to full stature the illusion of liberty equality fraternity the impossibly glorious illusion of democracy before they will have a giant s strength to lead men and compel nations But the day of their power will surely come may their discipline be more humane   than that of the war lords of the past and not too soft to satisfy the human need of heroism  Meantime by way of compensation for its awful and immeasurable losses the world must get what comfort it can out of heroic self sacrifice and the purging and cleansing effect of war Blood washes cleaner than water in its flood the subtle degeneracies the rotten sores of an over ripe civilization may be purified obliterated Already we hear a new statement of values even we who are sea walled from the tumult And the sternness of it silences a thousand once loud voices of comfort and despair  There will be a new statement of values in the arts Many little schools are like to disappear while painters sculptors poets follow the danger trails of beauty The lithe muse is like to strip her followers bare of ornaments luxuries affectations to summon them out of their halls and garrets for a stern heroic march into a wild new kingdom of untried and dangerous illusions that kingdom of the future in which the race will be born again to its endless sorrow its unconquerable joy and its undying hope of peace on earth  And so it may be with a deeper meaning than usual a more heroic plunge of the spirit into veiled distances that we wish each other this year Merry Christmas  H M   MODERN GEORGICS  North of Boston by Robert Frost David Nutt London  It is a sinister thing that so American I might even say so parochial a talent as that of Robert Frost should have to be exported before it can find due encouragement and recognition  Even Emerson had sufficient elasticity of mind to find something in the yawp One doesn t need to like a book or a poem or a picture in order to recognize artistic vigor But the typical American editor of the last twenty years has resolutely shut his mind against serious American writing I do not exaggerate I quote exactly when I say that these gentlemen deliberately write to authors that such and such a matter is too unfamiliar to our readers  There was once an American editor who would even print me so I showed him Frost s Death of the Hired Man He wouldn t have it he had printed a weak pseudo Masefieldian poem about a hired man two months before one written in a stilted pseudo literary language with all sorts of floridities and worn out ornaments  Mr Frost is an honest writer writing from himself from his own knowledge and emotion not simply picking up the manner which magazines are accepting at the moment and applying it to topics in vogue He is quite consciously and definitely putting New England rural life into verse He is not using themes that anybody could have cribbed out of Ovid   There are only two passions in art there are only love and hate with endless modifications Frost has been honestly fond of the New England people I dare say with spells of irritation He has given their life honestly and seriously He has never turned aside to make fun of it He has taken their tragedy as tragedy their stubbornness as stubbornness I know more of farm life than I did before I had read his poems That means I know more of Life  Mr Frost has dared to write and for the most part with success in the natural speech of New England in natural spoken speech which is very different from the natural speech of the newspapers and of many professors His poetry is a bit slow but you aren t held up every five minutes by the feeling that you are listening to a fool so perhaps you read it just as easily and quickly as you might read the verse of some of the sillier and more vivacious writers  A sane man knows that a prose short story can t be much better than the short stories of De Maupassant or of Steve Crane Frost s work is interesting incidentally because there has been during the last few years an effort to proceed from the prose short story to the short story in verse Francis Jammes has done a successful novel in verse in a third of the space a prose novel would have taken Existences in La Triomphe de la Vie Vildrac and  D H Lawrence have employed verse successfully for short stories Masefield is not part of this movement He has avoided all the difficulties of the immeasurably difficult art   Modem Georgics  of good prose by using a slap dash flabby verse which has been accepted in New Zealand Jammes Vildrac and Lawrence have lived up to the exigencies of prose and have gained by brevity This counts with serious artists  Very well then Mr Frost holds up a mirror to nature not an oleograph It is natural and proper that I should have to come abroad to get printed or that H D with her clear cut derivations and her revivifications of Greece should have to come abroad or that Fletcher with his tic and his discords and his contrariety and extended knowledge of everything should have to come abroad One need not censure the country it is easier for us to emigrate than for America to change her civilization fast enough to please us But why IF there are serious people in America desiring literature of America literature accepting present conditions rendering American life with sober fidelity why in heaven s name is this book of New England eclogues given us under a foreign imprint  Professors to the contrary notwithstanding no one expects Jane Austen to be as interesting as Stendhal A book about a dull stupid hemmed in sort of life by a person who has lived it will never be as interesting as the work of some author who has comprehended many men s manners and seen many grades and conditions of existence But Mr Frost s people are distinctly real Their speech is real he has known them I don t want much to meet them but I know that they exist and what is more that they exist as he has portrayed them   Mr Frost has humor but he is not its victim The Code has a pervasive humor the humor of things as they are not that of an author trying to be funny or trying to bring out the ludicrous phase of some incident or character because he dares not rely on sheer presentation There is nothing more nauseating to the developed mind than that sort of local buffoonery which the advertisements call racy the village wit presenting some village joke which is worn out everywhere else It is a great comfort to find someone who tries to give life the life of the rural district as a whole evenly and not merely as a hook to hang jokes on The easiest thing to see about a man is an eccentric or worn out garment and one is godforsakenly tired of the post Bret Hartian post Mark Twainian humorist  Mr Frost s work is not accomplished but it is the work of a man who will make neither concessions nor pretences He will perform no money tricks His stuff sticks in your head not his words nor his phrases nor his cadences but his subject matter You do not confuse one of his poems with another in your memory His book is a contribution to American literature the sort of sound work that will develop into very interesting literature if persevered in  I don t know that one is called upon to judge between the poems in North of Boston The Death of the Hired Man is perhaps the best or The Housekeeper though here the construction is a bit straggly There are moments in Mending Wall The Black Cottage is very clearly stated  Ezra Pound   Two Kings  TWO KINGS  Philip the King and other Poems by John Masefield Will  iam Heinemann The King of the Dark Chamber by Rabindranath Tagore Macmillan Mr Masefield s new book contains several poems al  ready familiar to readers of The English Review and American periodicals Truth August 1914 Biography Ships and The River several shorter poems and translations and a new dramatic poem from which the book takes its title This new poem Philip the King is singularly effective Whether it would have seemed so effective if it had been published before August first of this year one can not say Certainly it loses nothing by being published at this moment when the genius of empire is again to be tested to some form of bitter conclusion For Philip the Second of Spain was a man who had the genius of empire and Mr Masefield shows us at what a bitter cost that empire was won and lost Mr Masefield is not the poet of victorious empire he is too much the poet of life and of the significance of common human experience for that The quiet depth of feeling which has always been the most vital feature of his work is shown to much better advantage in this book than in anything else that he has written The spirit of Mr Masefield s poem on the war August I914 in which he feels through the beauty of the English fields   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  the unknown generations of dead men whose dumb lives contributed to that beauty  Who century after century held these farms And looking out to watch the changing sky Heard as we hear the rumors and alarms Of war at hand and danger pressing nigh  this spirit is emphasized in Philip the King in many forceful passages of strength and beauty not the less strong because their subtly revolutionary import is thus veiled in beaut Perhaps after all an empire in defeat furnishes the most truthful source of study of empire The froth of victory ignores the volume of the wave as it ignores the waste and wreckage which is not cast up for reckoning until a later day Mr Noyes may celebrate the froth but Mr Masefield counts the wreckage  One would like to dwell at greater length upon this poem but the reader will gain more from reading it than one may suggest in a review  In addition to these there are in this volume one or two short poems and several translations from the Spanish and Portuguese remarkable for their simplicity of diction and direct feeling better models for the young poet than the more generally imitated narrative poems by Mr Masefield There is throughout the book less of the melodramatic and banal sentimentality noted in his narrative poems There is greater restraint and greater strength a more masculine expression Yet it may be noted in conclusion that the cumulative feeling of the book is one of intense   Two Kings  sadness Temperamentally Mr Masefield has the tragic sense the sense of beauty that is most poignant because of its impermanence the nobility of human action reared upon frailty the celebration of the moment that is the moment s death  And no new stones laid where the trackway ends Is there no further assurance no joy that transcends the joy s decease  In The King of the Dark Chamber Mr Rabindranath Tagore indeed records a joy that it is impossible for many of us of the western mold of faith to attain to No less sensitive to the moment s death every moment s death is yet for this poet that moment s birth in a kingdom which is continuously active and in which death and negation have no part The word mystic is too often misapplied to convey a precise impression and it may be that for western readers the term used by Mr Llewellyn Jones when he spoke of Mr Tagore as spiritual empyricist will be most serviceable as a definition of the author s quality The King of the Dark Chamber first published in The Drama for May 1914 is a dramatic expression of the reconciliation between the soul and God A contrast wider than that between this drama and the western conception of such a conciliation as recorded in Bunyan s Pilgrim s Progress could hardly be conceived Perhaps it is because the western mind has had so little worthy imaginative food that the western soul has so slight an acquaintance with God and that God as Mr Tagore once remarked remains a stranger to the western soul   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  This is the play that Mr Tagore read before a company of people in Cambridge Massachusetts to their complete mystification  I suppose said one lady at least courageous in voicing her impression I suppose that by the King of the dark chamber you mean the spirit of evil And I suppose that in your eastern oriental way you mean that we should not struggle against it but give in to it be reconciled but that drawing herself up proudly that is not our western way Mr Tagore we fight It was the poet himself who repeated the story A C H  OTHER REVIEWS  Borderlands and Thoroughfares by Wilfrid Wilson Gibson  Macmillan  This poet has hewn his art out of shale and slate stubborn materials which show harsh clefts and ridges which scorn to be smooth and fine He seems to be still learning in fact he has scarcely more than begun his work But already the observer standing not too near may see that the figure he is hammering into shape has large lines massiveness structure a lonely monumental dignity  Mr Gibson has deliberately studied the poor British peasants and laborers tramps and vagabonds One does not feel in his poems that pre natal intimacy which exists between Mr Robert Frost and his New England farmer neighbors but one does feel knowledge insight and sure   Other Reviews  imaginative sympathy Sometimes he slips up in his phrasing do English hinds say ere for example and no doubt the hinds themselves could find graver faults But behind the realism of his scenic effects the truth to character and environment as he sees them is a realization of that limitless background of mystery which widens all human lives His hinds and tramps feel airs from Arcady and salt mists from a polar sea His London burglar must have a night in the heather and let his imagination rove over the wilds His old hind in The Queens Crags was a poet once when in his youth he loved a circus rider  I see her tripping now into the ring  With flashing eyes and teeth  Clean limbed and mettlesome as the coal black  mare  Coal black from mane to fetlocks  That pawed and champed to greet her And the forty lines which follow send us racing round the ring with her and give us the young man s exaltation even through the old man s memory  In short Mr Gibson is working out an interpretation of life It is sculpturesque rather than pictorial and the light upon it is not sunshine but the veiled gray monotone of an English November The figure which begins to emerge is larger than life and not exact in realism but it is nobly descriptive It gives us the profounder instincts and higher imaginings of people deeply rooted in reality people whom harsh life strips bare of luxury and pretence  Besides the three dialogues in this book we have nearly thirty brief poems Through all of them one feels the   wind blowing and most of them carry a suggestion of the  eeriness of common things as in The Lodging House And when at last I stand outside My garret door I hardly dare To open it Lest when I fling it wide With candle lit And reading in my only chair I find myself already there A minor but most welcome detail is this poet s love of  animals Certain horses and dogs live in these pages es  pecially that noble minded bitch Mabel  Stubborn wild and white  Snuffing the wet air of the windy night And the last poem pictures the sun enkindled fire Of gorse upon the moor top  Indeed we are out of doors in wild places throughout  this volume H M  Sword Blades and Poppy Seed by Amy Lowell Macmillan  Miss Lowell s title poem or rather her initial poem which interprets the book s title is a kind of apologia a presentation of her ideals as an artist Poetry she insists must either pierce or soothe the heart of man and her manner of telling the illustrative dream tale of a poet s visit to the Dealer in Words presents the utmost vigor not to say rigor of her style W e have stripped and trenchant metaphors as in these lines  All day my thoughts had lain as dead Unborn and bursting in my head My table seemed a graveyard full Of coffins waiting burial   Other Reviews  W e have vivid descriptive passages pictures painted in a few bold strokes like these of Wedgwood and Chinese porcelains  There was dusky blue of Wedgwood ware The carved white figures fluttering there Like leaves adrift upon the air   These porcelains with unknown hues Of reds dyed purple and greens turned blues Of lustres with so evanescent a sheen Their colors are felt but never seen  And lastly we have the poet s sense of consecration ex  pressed in the conditions imposed by the merciless Dealer The money I demand is Life Your nervous force your joy your strife Who buy of me must simply pay Their whole existence quite away And he describes the sacrifice in detail If at times one feels inclined to quarrel with Miss Lowell s technical experiments if she does not quite convince us for example through such a poem as The Forsaken that Paul Fort s obscure measures and empirical internal rhymes may be as effective in English as in French still one must admit her learning and her artistry She is a good workman even though at times the mere workmanship is a bit too apparent She lives in her own time not in the Victorian or the Elizabethan and knows what is going on in her art not only in New York and London but in Paris And beyond her intimate knowledge of French is a cosmopolitan consciousness which may even embrace remoter capitals In short her book unlike so many which belie   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  their twentieth century date does not impose upon us either sloppy technique or a purely domestic and provincial point of view  Miss Lowell has submitted to the stark discipline of the Imagistes but she has not like most of them altogether discarded rhyme The long poems are all in rhyme and mostly in stanzas of these Max Brueck is perhaps the least effective while A Tale of Starvation and Sancta Maria are intimate and poignant character studies Among the shorter poems are one or two fine sonnets and several pieces like Apology and Patience play delicately with rhymes without losing feeling in their meshes  But it is in the freer forms that this poet gets her finest effects Such poems as A Lady Music White and Green are well nigh flawless in their beauty perfect images Or this from The Captured Goddess  It was her wings Goddess Who stepped over the clouds And laid her rainbow feathers Aslant on the currents of the air  H M  The Single Hound by Emily Dickinson Little Brown amp Co  Emily Dickinson New England spinster of the nineteenth century was an unconscious and uncatalogued Imagiste She had the visual imagination the love of economy in line and epithet

is set Whose crumbs the crows inspect And with ironic caw Flap past it to the Farmer s corn Men eat of it and die  Mere existence was such an incredible ecstasy to this poet that she could not endure the rough and tumble of ordinary human intercourse Her fiery spirit went through  life  Attended by a Single Hound Its own Identity and encountered unendurable emotions in a tiny cottage and garden in sisterly affection in the passing homage of more or less detached lovers But to the last she was impenetrable unattainable in spite of her iridescent personal charm She was even to her own niece not daily bread but star dust There is a solitude of space A solitude of sea A solitude of death but these   Society shall be Compared with that profounder site That polar privacy A Soul admitted to Itself  Finite Infinity  The present volume may not increase the measure of her spiritual height and depth or add new lustre to her beauty of soul to the star like fidelity of her genius or the lithe nudity of her art These were established by the two earlier collections published soon after the poet s death But nothing in those precious books is finer than a few poems in this one which doubtless represents the final effort of her niece and literary executor to extricate Emily Dickinson s poems from a mass of ragged papers and preserve them for lovers of her temperamental art H M Trees and Other Poems by Joyce Kilmer George H  Doran New York  Joyce Kilmer has recently done a pleasant and perhaps an important thing he has rediscovered simplicity In the whole of this very slight little volume there is hardly a word or a technical device that could not be used with surety in a nursery rhyme Yet in the best of it is revealed a simple naivete of soul which reminds one forcibly of The Little Flowers of Saint Francis and which pleases in the same childlike fashion The title poem Trees originally published in POETRY is peculiarly successful in this mood It has an unusual haunting poignancy Successful also though reminiscent of the more deliberate simplicity of Oliver Wendell Holmes are The Tivelve Forty Five Martin and Servant Girl and Grocer s Boy But simplicity must be   Other Reviews  perfect and Mr Kilmer has not always been able to compass it Much of the verse in this volume is very slight indeed  The following little bit on Easter is so delightful that in spite of the fact that POETRY published it first we must reprint it  The air is like a butterfly  With frail blue wings  The happy eartli looks at the sky  And sings  E T The Reverberate Hills by Edwin Oppenheim Constable amp Co London The poems in this little volume are not verse for verse s sake but verse for the mountains sake They are in no way remarkable technically but they are so full of genuine love of the mountains of the vast white loneliness of the Alps and so full of sympathetic observation of the life of  man and beast in the great solitudes that they need no other justification E T CORRESPONDENCE  A LYRICAL CHALLENGE  To the Editor  In the August number of your admirable little magazine you reviewed Louis Untermeyer s latest volume Challenge in a most bewildering manner Luckily Untermeyer s poetry is well and widely known A dozen poems from this volume such as Prayer Caliban in the Coal   Mines and On the Birth of a Child have been reprinted from Maine to Miami from Hackensack to Nome Which is helpful for familiarity with any one of them enables the reader  To meet with confidence the cynic jeers  the astonishing objections of this reviewer  The editor finds two faults with this singer First that his phrases are worn and tawdry conventional trappings and claptrap utterances This of Louis Untermeyer It is true candor wrings from me the reluctant admission he does not sing of Mumpodorus Nimmin The Bulmenian Literati a young lady s Lar I trust this reference is not improper tomato cans scaly as leviathans ozily crawling gems culled from Verse in this same issue of the magazine These are not worn and tawdry Quite the reverse But to return to Louis Untermeyer and poetry the reverse of this criticism is true His poetry is the aggressive opposite of worn and tawdry The reviewer made quite a slip when she exhibited as samples of this alleged fault such phrases as meet indifference with a joyful rage vigorous discontent and the couplet  The scornful and untroubled skies The cold complacency of earth True these lines are not epoch making They scarcely mark a cosmic crisis But they are unworn fresh apt The stigma tagged upon them indicates let us hope nothing more than a surprising lapse of critical ability   Correspondence  The second objection that his art is muscle and brawn instead of a singing with the voice is as remove from the facts Untermeyer is first of all a singer a lyricist and his ever present loveliness of song if anything at times beguiles the attention from his message  Most amazing of all are the reviewer s preferences Haunted and The Shell to the Pearl are served up as the finest things in the book They are not the worst but they are neither noteworthy nor fairly representative Our editor does not even discover the exquisite whimsey of God s Youth the poignant passion of Tribute the clear loveliness of Summons The Great Carousal and several sonnets nor the deep lyric inspiration of Caliban in the Coal Mines  W e are swamped today beneath a flood of verse ranging from the exotic pseudo daring of the Imagists and the blundering polyrhythmics to the refined quavering of the hang overs of former times Out of this chaos and confusion comes this brave challenge this clear voice healthy vivid melodious Let me quote one of the best poems in the book Caliban in the Coal Mines as a cumulative answer to all objections  God we don t like to complain  We know that the mine is no lark  But there s the pools from the rain  But there s the cold and the dark  God You don t know what it is You in Your well lighted sky   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Watching the meteors whizz Warm with the sun always by  God if You had but the moon Stuck in Your Cap for a lamp Even You d tire of it soon Down in the dark and the damp  Nothing but blackness above  And nothing that moves but the cars  God if You wish for our love  Fling us a handful of stars  Clement Wood NOTE The reviewer of Challenge did not fail to read Caliban in the Coal Mines that cumulative answer to all objections  FROM LONDON DEATH OF A FRENCH POET  I have just seen in today s Chronicle that Charles Péguy poet socialist editor of Les Cahiers de la Quinzaine est mort pour la patrie at the battle of the Marne I have been glancing at one or two of his essays in Les Cahiers and in his Oeuvres Choisies He wasn t a personality which appealed to me though I knew him perfectly well by repute His work always seemed to be more political and socialist than literary But here is a piece of rather good emotional writing which I struck by accident It is called 0 flags of the past so fair in histories and runs thus  We are a sacrificed generation We are not only conquered that would be nothing There are glorious defeats sounding disasters more fixed better preservers of glory finer more accepted more commemorated than any triumph But our defeat is the worst of all an obscure defeat we shall not even be de   spised we shall be ignored perhaps we shall be grotesque There are defeats Waterloo was one which more than victories are fixed in the memories of man in the common memory of humanity We shall be niggards we shall be little we shall be ordinary we shall be mediocre or rather we shall not be at all Nobody will notice us We shall pass unperceived We shall never be great we shall never be known we shall never be written of  The date of that is 1909 but there is still much of the bitterness of 1870 in it  Péguy was a poet as well as an eloquent prose writer  I have before me three books of his poetry published in Les Cahiers de la Quinzaine La Tapisserie de Sainte Geneviève et de Jeanne d Arc La Tapisserie de Notre Dame and Eve The last is a huge long poem of four hundred pages written entirely in quatrains In this admittedly hasty absurdly superficial note I can t attempt to criticise it It gives a rather peculiar and epic effect by repeating one line at the beginning of about four to ten stanzas in sequence Thus  Et ce grand general qui prit tout un royaume Et ce n était pas rien le royaume de France Dans le dernier climat et sous le dernier dome N aura pas plus vielli que la jeune espérance  Et ce grand général qui saisit un royaume  Et quel saisissement le royaume de France  Dans le dernier climat et sous le dernier dome  Sera du meme jeu que la jeune espérance  It is a poem which quickly bores nevertheless it has  its points Note the martial subject in these verses taken  quite at hazard   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I gather from another book Le Mystère des Saints Innocents that M Péguy was a Roman Catholic as well as a militarist Indeed he belonged to the group of reactionaries satirized by France in La Révolte des Anges At the battle of the Marne Péguy probably fought somewhere near Guy Charles Cros one of the most satirical and delightful of the new poets of France Thus every shade of intellectual opinion as well as of political and religious difference is actually represented in the French army One of Péguy s essays seeks to prove that there was heroism in the large sense in a republic He had it proved to him before he died Richard Aldington  Note

LOWELL  Author of A Dome of Many Coloured Glass etc  In The Boston Herald Josephine Preston Peabody writes of this unusual book  First last and all inclusive in Miss Amy Lowell s poetic equipment is vitality enough to float the work of half a score of minor poets Against the multitudinous array of daily verse our times produce this volume utters itself with a range and brilliancy wholly remarkable With a flexibility color and motion sufficient to confute any monopolistic claim for the Unrhymed vers libre Miss Lowell has made with most of her Unrhymed cadences such things of beauty that they make particularly clear the complete difference of appeal between these forms and the regularly stressed forms of English verse A wealth of subtleties and sympathies gorgeously wrought full of macabre effects as many of the poems are and brilliantly worked out personally I cannot see that Miss Lowell s use of Unrhymed vers libre has been surpassed in English This breadth and ardor run through the whole fabric of the subject matter Here is the fairly  Dionysiac revelry of a tireless workman With an honesty as whole as anything in literature she hails any and all experience as stuff for poetry The things of splendor she has made she will hardly outdo in their kind  Price 1 25 net At all bookstores  Published by  THE MACMILLAN COMPANY  64 66 Fifth Avenue New York    Collectors of
