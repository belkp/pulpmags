that but seek your modest rolls and coffee When you have passed the bar and have  saluted Its watchful madam then pray enter softly The inner chamber even as one who treads  The haunts of mating birds and watch discreetly Over your paper s edge There in the corner Obscure ensconced behind the uncovered table A man and woman keep their silent tryst Outside the morning floods the pavement sweetly Yonder aloft a maid throws back the shutters The hucksters utter modulated cries As wistful as some old pathetic ballad Within the brooding lovers unaware   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Sit quiet hand in hand or in low whispers Communicate a more articulate love Sometimes she plays with strings and gently leaning Against his shoulder shows him childish tricks She has not touched the glass of milk before her Her breakfast and the price of their admittance She has a look devoted and confiding And might be pretty were not life so hard But he gaunt as his rusty bicycle That stands against the table and with features So drawn and stark has only futile strength The love they cherish in this stolen meeting Through all the day that follows makes her sweeter And him perhaps it only leaves more bitter But you that have not love at all old men That warm your fingers by this fire discreetly Play out your morning game of dominoes  THE VIEW AT GUNDERSON S  Sitting in his rocker waiting for your tea Gazing from his window this is what you see  A cat that snaps at flies a track leading down By log built shanties gray and brown  The corner of a barn and tangled lines of fence Of rough hewn pickets standing dense   The View at Gunderson s  The ghost of a tree on a dull wet day And the blanket fog where lies the bay  But when he s seen the last of you Sitting in his rocker what s his view  For there he sits day in day out Nursing his leg and his dreams no doubt  The snow slide up behind the gaard The farm beside old Trondjem fjord  Daughters seven with their cold blue eyes And the great pine where his father lies  The boat that brought him over the sea And the toothless woman who makes his tea  Their picture framed on the rough log wall Proves she had teeth when he was tall  He sees the balsam thick on the hill And all he s cleared with a stubborn will  And last he sees the full grown son For whom he hoards what he has won  You saw little worth the strife What he sees is one man s life   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE MASSEUR  In a chamber choked with shadows The dim light overhead Reveals a ghostly figure Bent down above my bed A figure dim and priestly Soft footed and discreet With sacramental beard and eyes Above his winding sheet  His eyes are close and narrow And shaded from the light But something strange and eerie Yet glitters to my sight His voice is soft and toneless With a hint of faraway Uncanny resonances heard Beyond our night and day  His fingers strong and skilful That follow every curve Wake quivers of sensation In each remotest nerve And ever as he passes His palms along my skin He goes on speaking grave and still Of Satan and of sin   The Masseur  And out of the prophet Daniel And out of John the seer He proves the Second Coming And how it draweth near  He strips the scarlet woman And lays the dragon bare And shows me Armageddon red About us everywhere  His voice grows faint and fainter His face I cannot see A flush of warmth and drowsiness  Flows up and covers me My waking soul goes under In gradual eclipse   I sleep and dream of judgment day And dread Apocalypse  THE POINT OF VIEW  I overtook her on the bridge Loitering in the morning gray And straight she told me all her heart In her direct and childish way  Helen was sick for long she said And slipped a trustful hand in mine   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  She never had to go to school And she had oranges and wine  When Helen died you should have seen The flowers so many and so bright Red roses all about her face And Helen s face so very white  JENNY S DANCING  When Jenny danced with Janet I saw two silver birches swaying To a breeze that left the hillside quiet Save for these white stems It singled out To set them tossing  I saw two flames Two slim and volatile Twin flames wind blown That wound and wound Their delicate bodies To a tune no ear could follow   And then came Rupert Hapless male And he took Jenny   Jenny s Dancing  He could not follow the tune The breeze passed by him And as he could not bend himself He broke her  CAVE TALK  What are you doing there by the shore  I m pushing out my boat I mean to follow the sun across To islands far remote It may be I shall find a land Where fruits and spices grow Fairer women stronger men And mountains topped with snow  Nay go not forth across the wave Where ghosts and monsters be What fairer folk can heart desire Than my sweet cubs and me And who shall bring us fish and flesh When you are gone away Come spread the net and string the bow But fare not far astray  What are you scratching there on the rock POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I m carving pictures here Feathered bird and otter furred To bide for many a year When a thousand moons have waxed and waned And I am dust and smoke Men shall behold my handiwork And praise the master stroke  O sluggard leave your idle ways Behold our bitter dearth We shiver in the frosty wind And couch upon the earth Go strip the otter and her cubs For coats and kirtles fine And pluck the feathered bird to strew A bed for me and mine  What are you doing out in the dark  I count the stars in the sky And wonder if they are the souls Of such as you and I And if the bear and the lean gray wolf Have souls like yours and mine That go to feed the milky way Or make the great stars shine  O dreamer what are the stars to you And the souls of wolf and bear   Cave Talk  The gray wolf prowls about the rock And sniffs upon the air His eyes are shining in the dark Like stars above the sea Build high the fire before the cave To guard my cubs and me  What do you see that stare so hard  A face all smooth and white And breasts and shoulders smooth and round And soft in the flickering light I muse how wondrous women are And how unlike to men I saw white arms in the sea at dawn Long since and never again   You love me not O stranger man Who talk of women and men Of white arms in the sea at dawn You love me never again You sit and dream the while I wait And the little ones all asleep Oh if you love me a little man Kiss me or I shall weep  Joseph Warren Beach   POETRY  A Magazine of Verse  ROOT BUDS  THE SHADOW  Soft as the bed in the earth Where a stone has lain So soft so smooth and so cool Spring closes me in With her arms and her hands  Rich as the smell Of new earth on a stone That has lain breathing The damp through its pores Spring closes me in With her blossomy hair Brings dark to my eyes  METRIC FIGURE  There is a bird in the poplars It is the sun The leaves are little yellow fish Swimming in the river The bird skims above them Day is on his wings Phoenix It is he that is making   Metric Figure  The great gleam among the poplars It is his singing Outshines the noise Of leaves clashing in the wind  SUB TERRA  Where shall I find you You my grotesque fellows That I seek everywhere To make up my band None not one With the earthy tastes I require The burrowing pride that rises Subtly as on a bush in May  Where are you this day You my seven year locusts With cased wings Ah my beauties how I long That harvest That shall be your advent Thrusting up through the grass Up under the weeds Answering me That shall be satisfying The light shall leap and snap That day as with a million lashes   POETRY A Magazine of Ve  Oh I have you Yes you are about me in a sense Playing under the blue pools That are my windows But they shut you out still There in the half light For the simple truth is That though I see you clear enough You are not there  It is not that it is you You I want my companions God if I could only fathom The guts of shadows You to come with me Poking into negro houses With their gloom and smell In among children Leaping around a dead dog Mimicking  Onto the lawns of the rich You To go with me a tip toe Head down under heaven Nostrils lipping the wind   Slow Movement  SLOW MOVEMENT  All those treasures that lie in the little bolted box whose tiny space is Mightier than the room of the stars being secret and filled with dreams All those treasures I hold them in my hand are straining continually Against the sides and the lid and the two ends of the little box in which I guard them Crying that there is no sun come among them this great while and that they weary of shining Calling me to fold back the lid of the little box and to give them sleep finally  But the night I am hiding from them dear friend is far more desperate than their night And so I take pity on them and pretend to have lost the key to the little house of my treasures For they would die of weariness were I to open it and not be merely faint and sleepy As they are now  A CONFIDENCE  Today dear friend this gray day I have been explaining to a young man of the West Indies   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  How the leaves all fall from the little branches And lie soon in crowds along the bare ground  How they lie On all sides so thick that no man May pass any way without touching them Or hearing at his feet a great crying out  But in no way at all could I have told him This that I tell you so easily How having become wise as a flame with watching Above the year since that time he lifted  His young face For a moment that time of the first passing They lie exultant pressing his foot prints Melting away because of their passion  William Carlos Williams   APOLOGIA  I think I have no soul Having instead two hands sensitive and curious And ten subtle and inquisitive fingers Which reach out continually into the world Touching and handling all things The fascination of objects The marvellous shapes Contours of faces and of dispositions Hearts that are tender or rough to the touch The smooth soft fabrics in which lives go clothed Hope and pity and passion All these as I touch them delight and enchant me And I think I could go on touching them forever But the impulse comes into the nerves of my fingers Into the muscles of my hands To give back this beauty in some shape Confessional of joy And so I make these toys

drink the wind of spring When the lilac s blossoming  A VILLAGE CHURCH  There is a little church I know With six white pillars in a row And for a hundred years or more God s people have gone through the door A goodly company are they Who come no more on Sabbath Day Sometimes I think the Sabbath air Is filled with little ghosts of prayer And in the rafters linger yet Words that the church cannot forget Full of old songs the belfry is And every pew has memories  Louise Driscoll   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE WORLD CRY  Joy light and love I crave  And shall discover  Life s wild adventure opening to my will High thought and brave The rapture of a lover  The Vision gleaming from yon western hill  Beyond my present sight  There lies some sweet allure  Some crested glory waiting to be won Shimmering in light Beautiful and sure  Beckoning bright hands that call me on  I know not where it lies  Nor whither I go nor how  The way is paved with pleasure or with pain But the search is in my eyes And the dust upon my brow  Shall turn to aureoled gold when I attain  Oh old old hope Unfulfilled desire Pitiful the faith Beautiful the fire   The World Cry  Know soul who criest Thy gleaming from afar Thy quest of wild adventure Thy sweet far star  Shall be the bitter path To a high stern goal So bow thy head T o thine own soul  Mary Aldis   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  NIGHTFALL  Deep bosomed dusk obscures The sun s last ray And night descending lures Westward the day Naught that we love endures For aye  Among the withered leaves The pale winds sigh And shrouded twilight weaves Her memories wistfully Summer but gilds his sheaves To die  Flowers that the morn found bright At evening fade Hours that have taken flight Can ne er be stayed Rome was eternal once Helen a maid  Maurice

white town A town for you and me With a Cafe Glacier in the square And schooners at the quay And the terrasse of a small hotel That looks upon the sea There gay sounds and sweet sounds And sounds of peace come through The cook sings in the kitchen The pink foot ring doves coo And Julien brings the Pernods That are bad for me and you   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  At St Blaise à la Zuecca Oh my dear Laugh your gentle laughter This old land From Provence to Paris never fear All the heart can feel will understand  III  Waves lap the beach pines stretch to meet the sea A pale light on the horizon lingers and shines That might shine round the graal and we Stand very silent underneath the pines  O swift expresses for the spirit s flight Sometimes the moon is like a maid I know Looking roguishly back and flying forward so I follow flashing after Blessed night  IV  Do you remember have you been these ways Dreaming or waking after sunny days Sailed in a moment to imagined lands With one to love you holding both your hands To old hot countries where the warm grape clings And an old musical language strikes the ear Like a caress most exquisite to hear Your soul the voyager and your heart her wings  Douglas Goldring   COMMENTS AND REVIEWS  GIVE HIM ROOM  AM moved sometimes to wonder at the narrowness of the field accorded to the poet by conservative public taste as compared with the freer range granted today as a matter of course to other artists  The architect must pass with ease from cottage to cathedral from the village shop to the skyscraper and in doing so he may take his choice of classic renaissance gothic secession or catch as catch can The painter may paint figures landscapes marines histories mysteries in any style that pleases him from Rembrandt to Cézanne from Cimabue to Kandinsky Even the sculptor despite the bulk and hardness of his medium has the freedom of marble bronze terracotta wax wood and many other substances and of all styles from the Chou dynasty to the futuristic dream in his own soul And the musician but his range is the widest of all he may compose song or symphony fugue or rhapsody opera fantasia or extravaganza and to express all the fine harmonies or riotous discords of his dream he may call on hundreds of cunning instruments singly or in miraculous unison and on the human voice as well and compel them to reveal him whether he be Bach or Debussy Wagner or Schoenberg  And all these various extremes in these various arts the public admits to its streets and gardens its theatres and con   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  cert halls its museums and exhibitions Indeed the more violent the extreme the more eagerly do we flock to see or hear the more firmly do we believe that we must see and hear in order to bring our culture or kultur up to date and meet the cannonading future with a quiet mind  But the poet the English writing poet today what does his potentially vast public expect of him His language circles the globe his era is cosmopolitan enormous full of newly released forces of newly emerging ideas He lives in a world which is wound in a net of rails and wires of sea ways and air ways a world of far kinships and inhuman wars of intolerable poverty and luxury incredible fellowships and isolations  To express the unprecedented magnificence of this modern era the unprecedented emotion of this changing world to tell the tale of the tribe to the future and thereby make the future as Homer and Dante and Shakespeare have made us the poet has but one instrument words To use this instrument adequately to make it resound far and wide to the heights and depths of the human spirit the poet has need of the utmost freedom and the utmost sympathy He needs as large and as eager an audience as any confrère in the other arts an audience giving him the widest liberty of experiment in his effort to enrich his instrument broaden its range and break down technical barriers between his art and the far flung modern tribes whom it must address  Yet instead of such a co operating public what does he find He finds an indifferent public loath to listen at all   Give Him Room  but demanding if it does listen close observance of the well worn formulae of rhymes and iambs which Chaucer imported from France in his scorn of the Anglo Saxon tradition If a poet ventures out of this classic park he is at once suspect the public gives him up as mentally afflicted and leaves the paragraphers to diagnoze his malady And even the more conservative of his fellow poets question his right to batter down sacred walls  Now POETRY has frankly tried to widen the poet s range to question conventional barriers whether technical or spiritual inherited from the past and help to bring the modern poet face to face with the modern world We have printed not only odes and sonnets blank verse dramas and rhymed pentameter narratives but imagistic songs futuristic fugues fantasies in vers libre rhapsodies in polyphonic prose any dash for freedom which seemed to have life and hope in it a fervor for movement and the beauty of open spaces even if the goal was vague and remote or quite unattainable in the distance  And probably we shall go on in this reckless course whether the public gathers in great numbers or not A certain public small perhaps but choice is gathering of that we receive indisputable evidence every day Even that satirical newspaper editor who turns one of our fugues upside down or that other who gaily parodies imagism or that graver one who points at us the finger of scorn all these are more or less consciously our friends for they are helping the public to WAKE UP to observe that something through   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  whatever illusions and extravagances is going on that poetry is not a dead art but a living one and that the poet today like the liberator of long ago WILL BE HEARD  H M  THE RENAISSANCE  III  No I am not such a fool as to believe that a man writes better for being well fed or that he writes better for being hungry either Hunger some experience of it is doubtless good for a man it puts an edge on his style and so does hard common sense In the end I believe in hunger because it is an experience and no artist can have too many experiences Prolonged hunger intermittent hunger and anxiety will of course break down a man s constitution render him fussy and over irritable and in the end ruin his work or prevent its full development  That nation is profoundly foolish which does not get the maximum of best work out of its artists The artist is one of the few producers He the farmer and the artisan create wealth the rest shift and consume it The net value of good art to its place of residence has been computed in logarithms I shall not go into the decimals When there was talk of selling Holbein s Duchess of Milan to an American England bought the picture for three hundred and fifty thousand dollars They figured that people came to London to see the picture that the receipts of the community were worth more   The Renaissance  per annum than the interest on the money People go where there are good works of art Pictures and sculpture and architecture pay Even literature and poetry pay for where there is enough intelligence to produce and maintain good writing there society is pleasant and the real estate values increase Mr F M Hueffer has said that the difference between London and other places is that No one lives in London merely for the sake of making money enough to live somewhere else  The real estate values even in Newark New Jersey would go up if Newark were capable of producing art literature or the drama In the quattrocento men went from one Italian city to another for reasons that were not solely commercial  The question is not Shall we try to keep up the arts but How can we maintain the arts most efficiently Paris can survive 1870 and 1914 because she is an intellectual and artistic vortex She is that vortex not because she had a university in the middle ages Cordova and Padua had also mediaeval universities France recognizes the cash value of artists They do not have to pay taxes save when convenient they have a ministry of fine arts doing its semi efficient best Literary but inartistic England moves with a slow paw pushing occasional chunks of meat towards the favored England does as well as can be expected considering that the management of such affairs is entrusted to men whose interests are wholly political and who have no sort of intuition or taste That is to say in England if someone of good social position   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  says that your work is really literary and that you are not likely to attack the hereditary interests or criticise the Albert Memorial you can be reasonably sure of a pension If your sales have suddenly slumped you can also have royal bounty provided that you respect the senile and decrepit and say a good word for Watts pictures  The result is that France gets Rodin s work when he is fifty instead of the day he began doing good work England gets Rodin s work after it has gone to seed and rejects the best work of Epstein in his full vigor England let half her last generation of poets die off and pensioned such survivors as hadn t gone into something practical  But even this is enough to show that bourgeois France and stolid England recognize the cash value of art I don t imagine that these sordid material considerations will weigh with my compatriots America is a nation of idealists as we all know and they are going to support art for art s sake because they love it because they want the best even in art They want beauty they can t get along without it They are already tired of spurious literature  They recognize that all great art all good art goes against the grain of contemporary taste They want men who can stand out against it They want to back such men and women to the limit How are they to go about it Subsidy Oh no They don t want to pauperize artists  Of course Swinburne was subsidized by his immediate forebears and Shelley also and Browning the robust the virile was subsidized by his wife and even Dante and Villon   The Renaissance  did not escape the stigma of having received charities Nevertheless it is undemocratic to believe that a man with money should give horrible word give it even though not all of it to painters and poets  They give it to sterile professors to vacuous preachers of a sterilized form of Christianity they support magazines whose set and avowed purpose is either to degrade letters or to prevent their natural development Why in heaven s name shouldn t they back creators as well as students of Quinet Why shouldn t they endow men whose studies are independent put them on an equal footing with men whose scholarship is merely a pasteurized Bostonized imitation of Leipzig  How are they to go about it Committees are notably stupid they vote for mediocrity their mind is the least common denominator Even if there are a few intelligent members the unintelligent members will be the ones with spare time and they will get about trying to run the committee trying to get in new members who will vote for their kind of inanity Et cetera ad infinitum  There is one obvious way which does not compel individuals to wait for an organization  Private people can give stipends to individual artists That is to say you Mr Rockefeller you Laird Andy of Skibo and the rest of you I am not leaving you out reader because you have only one million or half of one you can endow individuals for life just as you endow chairs in pedagogy and calisthenics More than that you can endow them with the right to name their successors If they don t   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  need the money they can pass it on before their deaths to younger artists in whom they believe  For instance you may begin by endowing Mr James Whitcomb Riley Mr George Santayana Mr Theodore Roosevelt Mr Jack London or anybody else you believe in And any artist will applaud you Any artist would rather have a benefice conferred upon him by one of these men as an individual than by a committee of the forty leading luminaries of literature I take a hard case I don t suppose for a moment that Mr Riley or Mr Roosevelt Mr Santayana or Mr London wants money in all probability they would one and all refuse it if offered but none of them would refuse the right of allotting an income sufficient to cover the bare necessities of life to some active artist whom they believe in  If you endow enough men individuals of vivid and different personality and make the endowment perpetual to be handed down from artist to artist you will have put the arts in a position to defy the subversive pressure of commercial advantage and of the mediocre spirit which is the bane and hidden terror of democracy  Democracies have fallen they have always fallen because humanity craves the outstanding personality And hitherto no democracy has provided sufficient place for such an individuality If you so endow sculptors and writers you will begin for America an age of awakening which will overshadow the quattrocento because our opportunity is greater than Leonardo s we have more aliment we have not one   The Renaissance  classic tradition to revivify we have China and Egypt and the unknown lands lying upon the roof of the world Khotan Kara shar and Kan su  So much for the individual opportunity now for the civic Any city which cares for its future can perfectly well start its vortex It can found something between a graduate seminar and the usual Arts Club made up of business men and of a few rather more than middle aged artists who can afford to belong  I have set the individually endowed artist against the endowed professor or editor I would set the endowment of such grouping of young artists parallel with the endowment for one year or three of scholars and fellows by our universities Some hundreds of budding professors are so endowed to say nothing of students of divinity  There is no reason why students of the arts not merely of painting but of all the arts should not be so endowed and so grouped that is as artists not merely as followers of one segregated art Such endowment would get them over the worst two or three years of their career the years when their work can t possibly pay  Scientists are so endowed It is as futile to expect a poet to get the right words or any sort of artist to do real work with one eye on the public as it would be to expect the experimenter in a chemical laboratory to advance the borders of science if he have constantly to consider whether his atomic combinations are going to flatter popular belief or suit the holders of monopolies in some over expensive com   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  pound The arts and sciences hang together Any conception which does not see them in their interrelation belittles both What is good for one is good for the other  Has any one yet answered the query why is it that in other times artists went on getting more and more powerful as they grew older whereas now they decline after the first outburst or at least after the first successes Compare this with the steady growth of scientists  The three main lines of attack then which I have proposed in this little series of articles are as follows  First that we should develop a criticism of poetry based on world poetry on the work of maximum excellence It does not in the least matter whether this standard be that of my own predilections or crochets or excesses It matters very much that it be decided by men who have made a firsthand study of world poetry and who have had the tools in their hands  Second that there be definite subsidy of individual artists writers etc such as will enable them to follow their highest ambitions without needing to conciliate the ignorant en route Even some of our stock size magazine poets might produce something worth while if they could afford occasionally to keep quiet for six months or a year at a stretch  Third there should be a foundation of such centres as I have described There should be in America the gloire de cénacle Tariff laws should favor the creative author rather than the printer but that matter is too long to be gone into   Praise from Mr Colum  In conclusion the first of these matters must be fought out among the artists themselves The second matter concerns not only the excessively rich but the normally and moderately rich who contribute to all sorts of less useful affairs redundant universities parsons Y M C A s and the general encouragement of drab mediocrity The third matter concerns millionaires multimillionaires and municipalities  When a civilization is vivid it preserves and fosters all sorts of artists painters poets sculptors musicians architects When a civilization is dull and anemic it preserves a rabble of priests sterile instructors and repeaters of things second hand If literature is to reappear in America it must come not through but in spite of the present commercial system of publication Ezra Pound  PRAISE FROM MR COLUM  The Art and Literature Department of the Chicago Woman s Club gave a luncheon on March 27th in honor of Mr Padraic Colum the Irish poet after his morning lecture on modern Irish poetry Complimentary speeches were made by Mr Karleton Hackett of the Chicago Evening Post Prof Cross of the department of Celtic literature in the University of Chicago and Prof Dickinson of the English department at Madison Then Mrs J H Buckingham who presided called upon Prof Ferdinand Schevill to speak of local appreciation of the art and especially of POETRY   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Mr Schevill though in the department of history at the University is one of the most discriminating connoisseurs of poetry in the country with a talent for reading it aloud as rare as Isaye s mastery of the violin To hear this lover of beautiful cadence read the Nightingale or the Prothal amion is a memorable experience of perfect art But that is another story  Mr Schevill told the club members and guests of his early reluctance to subscribe for POETRY and his hesitation before unwrapping the first number his fear that it would prove banal This feeling he said changed to delight as he read the little brochure and since then each number has been welcomed with ever keener zest until now he looks forward to POETRY as the finest and most stimulating of all his periodical visitors He wound up by frankly urging his two hundred hearers to give themselves similar pleasure by subscribing  The guest of honor Mr Colum in seconding this suggestion told of the eagerness with which the magazine is received and handed around among English and Irish poets and their appreciation of its success in gathering together the best work of the various schools and informing the world of what the American poets are doing It is far and away better than any magazine of the kind in England or Ireland he said in fact I think POETRY is the best magazine by far in the English language  In the face of such authoritative praise from the poet and the connoisseur of poetry the editor need say nothing but   Reviews  urge the friends of the magazine to spread the news and gather in an ever increasing public H M  REVIEWS  Songs from the Clay by James Stephens Macmillan  There are various kinds of enchantment in this brief volume First an elfin glee that shivers with delight that finds an unexpected vigor and beauty by simply nosing around underneath the obvious The tremor of wildness in nature the glint of unseen wings the beat of fairies feet the tune on the wind the terror in the void it is perhaps the special privilege of the Celt to discern these things but few even of the Celts have presented them with such witty brevity such choice felicity of phrase as Mr Stephens commands from his happy muse Whatever he says one believes no matter what the miracle may be  I was there all alone in the night With the moon and we talked for a while And her face was a wonder of light And her smile was a beautiful smile She leaned down and I nearly went mad And she was as frightened as me But I got the kiss that she had Intended to give to the sea Who would doubt this moon magic Or who can fail to see this satyr creeping through the wood He peeped about he minced upon the ground He put a thin hand up to hide a grin He doubled up and laughed without a sound The very bodiment of happy sin   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Also tragic intensities of mystery are stated with the same high simplicity the same convincing austerity of phrase For  example In the Night  There always is a noise when it is dark It is the noise of silence and the noise Of blindness  The noise of silence and the noise of blindness Do frighten me They hold me stark and rigid as a tree  These frighten me These hold me stark and rigid as a tree Because at last their tumult is more loud Than thunder  Because at last Their tumult is more loud than thunder They terrify my soul They tear my heart asunder  The poet s intimacies are not alone with sprites and elfin mysteries however he has a deep human tenderness for grass and flowers singing birds and suffering animals The Snare is in the same class with Burns To a Field Mouse and the resemblance of the trapped rabbit to sufferers higher in the social scale is not the less poignant for not being stated  I hear a sudden cry of pain There is a rabbit in a snare Now I hear the cry again But I cannot tell from where  But I cannot tell from where  He is calling out for aid Crying on the frightened air Making everything afraid   Reviews  Making everything afraid Wrinkling up his little face As he cries again for aid And I cannot find the place  And I cannot find the place Where his paw is in the snare Little one O little one I am searching everywhere This linking of stanzas together by the repetition of the last line is a device employed by Mr Stephens with rare discretion By this and other repetitions and by the extreme simplicity of his diction he aids his own conviction to convince us Let me recommend this modern Irishman to the numerous poets of the O thou school who search the chronicles and dictionaries for antique subjects and Elizabethan phrases We rarely believe them for an instant whereas we never question the truth of whatever Mr Stephens chooses to summon out of nothingness in lithe and naked beauty  H M  The Night Watchman and Other Poems by Vance Thompson Kennerley Mr Thompson s poems express in mournful music the  sensuous passions and despairs of an emotional soul One does not usually question the poet s conviction or the languorous beauty of his rhythmic tunes  But oh the reader living in this year of grace or rather of turmoil 1915 does beg him to wake up His book is pervaded by the heavily perfumed atmosphere of the nineties It is full of dim years and augural nights of lethal   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  wine and nenuphars of avid girls and temptuous thighs and desultory suave serpents all of which interesting phenomena went out of fashion in 1900 and are no longer effective except to arouse dim memories of echoes  We should like to recommend to this poet and others similarly unaware of their epoch a few months discipline as reader for POETRY They would get so tired of artificial and hyperbolic language and of supersensuous experiences that they would sign a pledge one and all to sing hereafter only in words of one syllable on the commonest every day affairs In short they would go forth holding up the stark nude figure of Simplicity as the only modern muse  That Mr Thompson is too good a poet to resign himself to those lethal years aforesaid is the special reason why we urge upon him this discipline The Night Watchman When Love Died and The City are typical of his style at its best Also this lyric The Swallow  There s a swallow flying to Venice  And sick for a sight of the sea  O wayfarer O swallow  Fly light and low I would follow  To the dim blue isles of Venice  And the blue dim light of the sea  I am sick for the strange new faces  For the flags and the ships and the sea  For the new strange life and the singing  For the boatman s cries and the ringing  Of bells in the windy places  And the windy foam on the sea  H M   Reviews  The Little King by Witter Bynner Kennerley  Here is Louis XVII again one of the children of sorrow whom the world will not permit to die In Mr Bynner s hands he is an ideally royal little lad who refuses to escape from his tormentors when this means leaving a substitute in misery A touching play whose characters though possibly too consistent too true to type are dramatically contrasted in a succession of emotional scenes moving to a pathetic climax Apparently this brief little play would act well H M  Lyrics of a Lad by Scharmel Iris Seymour Daughaday amp  Co Chicago  At his best this Italian American poet has a delicate fancy and a true lyric touch As yet he too often imitates Keats and other classics and he likes too well stock figures and phrases like the rubies of sun set the gold of the morn pale twilight s bier war s red hell In the same way one finds him sometimes making poetry by sheer force of will instead of by compulsion of inner vision  But these are perhaps faults of youth Mr Iris may be preparing his technic for the visions to come Even now a few of these lyrics seem deeply felt and austerely expressed Besides those published last December in POETRY of which Early Nightfall is especially lovely we would mention I am a weary as the wind A Nameless Prayer and this brief Iteration  My son is dead and I am going blind And in the Ishmael wind of grief   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  I tremble like a leaf I have no mind for any word you say My son is dead and I am going blind  H M At the Shrine by George Herbert Clarke Stewart amp Kidd Co  Three or four poems in this book Last Desire Chess Player The Mother Tryst almost persuade one that Mr Clarke might be a poet if he could forget all the poetry he ever read But usually he is saying O thou in conventional measures and rattling a bag of rhymes in which he reveals no more music If only he could be less agile he might move more gracefully and get nearer his goal  Remember Louvain a Little Book of Liberty and War  selected by E V Lucas Methuen amp Co Ltd Lon  don  This brief anthology of war poems is misnamed in that it consists mostly of well known classics among which are poems of four Americans Whitman Whittier Longfellow and Mrs Howe The living poets in its rather short list are Messrs Newbolt Noyes Conan Doyle and Kipling but nothing from these is so stirring as Henley s England my England or certain older and more familiar songs  The Gypsy Trail an Anthology for Campers compiled by  Pauline Goldmark and Mary Hopkins Kennerley  This volume conveniently small for camping purposes seems the result of wide reading a free open air spirit and good taste on the part of its editors It ranges from the   Our Contemporaries  Book of Job to Fiona Macleod from Lucretius to Bliss Carman and few lovers of the open road would object to many of the entries  OUR CONTEMPORARIES  ART AND PHOTOGRAPHY  Miss Amy Lowell had an interesting review of Mr Robert Frost s North of Boston in a recent number of The New Republic This new weekly by the way gives promise of competent criticism of art and letters and the fact that it has in one or two instances followed some of POETRY S leads is not a little gratifying  Miss Lowell s review is valuable because it gives one poet s personal impression of another But Miss Lowell is not herself a realist and perhaps that is why she seems to have missed the essential quality of Mr Frost s work The exception taken to the following paragraph is not a mere quibble This comparison of art and photography is a commonplace so unsound and false that it should be relegated to the ash heap  I have said that Mr Frost s work is almost photographic The qualification was unnecessary it is photographic The pictures the characters are reproduced directly from life they are burnt into his mind as though it were a sensitive plate He gives out what has been put in unchanged by any personal process His imagination is bounded by what he has seen he is confined within the limits of his experience or at least what might have been his experience and bent all one way like the wind blown trees of New England hillsides   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  It would have been more just if Miss Lowell had said Mr Frost s work carries such a conviction of reality that it is impressed upon the reader s mind as if upon a sensitive photographic film For how has this effect been achieved Certainly not by any non selective mechanical photographic process on Mr Frost s part How is it possible for any human being least of all an artist to give out what has been put in unchanged by any personal mental process And even if Mr Frost were as non selectively receptive as a kodak by whom then or by what agency was the remarkably selective material of his poems put in Who put into Mr Frost what came out of him Who took the trouble to arrange the hills and the blackberry fields and the stark New England people in just the right folds for Mr Frost s kodak mind if all volition on his part is left out of the question  The artist not the kodak is the arbiter of realism in art Even if external truth were considered as the final end of art which is ridiculous the kodak is a notorious liar in comparison with the human eye  From Miss Lowell s estimate one gains the impression that Mr Frost is still in the stage of unreasoning response to external stimuli that he is in short unconscious of his own reactions And this colors her entire view of the man s work Because the poet speaks through his characters Miss Lowell attributes to him their lack of humor But humor depends upon a certain detachment of vision and without   Art and Photography  it Mr Frost could not have given us the essentially satiric quality of these grim New England people to whom the one saving grace of humor the ability to see themselves with a detached vision is denied  Miss Lowell herself seems to have a fixed idea about Mr Frost s purpose in giving us a mirror of New England life She speaks of the poem Home Burial as representing a New England woman who is unable to take up the burden of life after her child has died Now it is very possible that that woman was not a New Englander At any rate she represents a much less callous type than her husband In him is the sinister quality of New England life in its most desperate form a life of kill joy practicality of a hardness to things of beauty and feeling almost unbelievable to one of a mold less cramped and harsh It would not be the death of her child that would drive this woman insane If this woman had been less normally responsive in feeling there would not have been the essential tragedy of this poem in fact this poem would not have been at all  That the reader identifies Mr Frost with his characters is simply indicative of the high quality of Mr Frost s art This is the highest form of synthetic realism Mr Frost may indeed write with his eye on the object but his vision penetrates the object and infuses it with that imaginative life which is the primary and essential quality of art  A C H  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  CORRESPONDENCE  DEATH OF A YOUNG GERMAN POET  Editor of POETRY SO far only one German poet has been reported as killed in the war Georg Frakl Frakl belonged to the new school in feeling if not in form His  chief gift was his ability to select the salient qualities of a landscape and by reproducing them with a few strokes of graphic and imaginative power convey a rich yet subtle  impression of the whole In the death of Frakl German literature has lost a young poet of decided originality and promise Charles Wharton Stork  Mr Stork who is in the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania translates as follows one of Frakl s finest lyrics  WHISPERED IN THE AFTERNOON  Feebly glints the sun s thin ray From the tree the ripe fruit falleth In the deep blue

we have ever known it This town together with the whole country seems to be waking up to poetry and the other arts as never before Never has there been such a genuine and widespread interest in it I really believe the place has come to be as alive as Chicago  There now Perhaps in the future you will trust my powers as soothsayer The other day when I expressed this sentiment you feared I might be over excited by the interest of people in our own circle You doubted my power to catch far off vibrations Now if there should be an American renascence and it could be traced to 543 Cass Street what would you say to that Yours very sincerely  Edgar Lee Masters  MR CARY PROTESTS  My dear Editor Now that you have so graciously corrected your injustice to Mr Browne may I ask that you consider your

course of a review of all the periodicals published in Chicago which have or pretend to have anything to do  with literature I made certain specific criticisms of The Dial but I think I made no statements one way or the other about its conventionality or about its financial history I am and was under the impression that The Dial is a peculiarly successful business enterprise Indeed what I
