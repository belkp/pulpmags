the individual soul fought desperately and triumphantly for its Copyright1915by Margaret CAnderson The Little Review preservationAnd there is no genius in the daughterThere is merely the divine and natural instinct for self realizationOnce the mother felt it and it was killedNow the daughter has caught the dread disease the contamination which starts a cold sweat under the corset stays of society the thing which brings down upon it for its destruction the phalanxes of fierce fatuities the moribund mercenaries employed by the home for its defense and preservationSomething happens to crystallize the revoltIt is a man outside the palea good mana bad manIt is a bookIt is a friendOften the struggle is fought through little things too numerous to mention and the struggle itself too casual to classifySometimes it wages without a word at other times there are blowsAnd at such times the enshrouding veils are torn asideOne can see the dead rise uptheir pasty limbs dragging with the mould and slime of their couchOne can see them reaching their dead arms outwith the bloodless flesh hanging from them in shredsOne can watch them crawl on their bony feet and as they come closethese dead the foul odor that issues from their sightlesstwistedrotted faces hangs like a grey smeared canopy above themThey comeThey take their stand at the mother s backAnd the pitiful struggle is onIt is the mother who strikes the blowsHer first weaponshe uses it like a poisonis her loveShe calls it that You are my only happiness she cries I have given you everythinga part of meall you have neededI have sacrificed everything for youAll my dreams have been for youOhow can you permit anything to come between us The daughter listensThere is a selfish ring to itBut love must be forgiven for selfishnessIn the schools and the churches the preliminaries of the struggle have been insidiously foughtChildren owe duties to their parents and not to themselvesIt was what the daughter learned at schoolIt is what she read between the lines of her books and heard from the lips of all around herAnd now it is the murmur that rolls into her earsIt is the odor of the deadDay after day the mother strikes with this weaponHer redfurious eyes dripping tearsshe moans it outHer voice is like the yelp of a frantic animalHer voice is like the whine of a woebegone ficeHer voice is cold and hard and hollow like the echo in a tombThe beauty that has come to her daughter is a fragile thingThe lovliness she visioned is the most delicately mortal of life s treasuresFiercely the mother hurls herself against ithurls the reproaches of her dead soulthe recriminations of her entombed spirit the odors of the dead And her weapons are tangible thingsThey are sentencesThey are the moral perversions with which the family unit always has fought for its preservationThey are tried thingsprophetic precedentsAnd the beauty The Little Review 3 in the normal being is an indefinite force a vaguenessIt has no weapons with which to strikeTriumphant revolt is only for martyrs and artistsIt is the losing force in normal existence Gradually it becomes clouded in the daughter s soulShe feels uncleanShe imagines it is the beauty which is uncleanShe does not know that it is the uncleanliness of the dead the uncleanliness of her mother revealed to her in her heart by the divine light that is dying within herselfAn agony comes into herThe struggle narrows to painCold things reach at her heartIt leaps and fluttersShe standsher face white and a look of uncanny suffering about her eyesThe dead fingers grip fastThe mothermoaningshudderingher eyes gleamingenfolds her daughter in her arms I dare you to take her from me she cries out to the manto the friendto the bookto the world of beautywhatever it is toward which her daughter inclined for the divine instant of awakened soulI dare youI dare youNothing can ever take me from you the daughter weepsDeathTearsa form of decomposition nowroll from her cheeksThe struggle is overThe unit has been preserved and now one may look at the unit and see what it isThe rotted figures of the dead have dragged their shredded flesh back to the gravesThere are different kinds of familiesOnly in the struggle between the dead and the living do they become the same even when the contestants differI will describe only one typePerhaps it is the American familyperhaps it is notIt is the family which considers culture a matter of polished fingernails and emotional suppression and dinner table aphorismspuns and the classics in half morroccoIt has bound volumes of The Philistine or some other mawkish philosophical twaddle on view in the bookcaseIt the spirit of this family knows the titles of books memorized from literary reviews in current magazines and will discourse bitingly on the malicious trend of these radical volumes from the sweeping knowledge she has of their titlesIn the matter of music the spirit of this familyplays safe It will characterize astinklyorsyrupyanything melodious which secretly pleases itThe rather humorous falseness of its culture is inexhaustibleIntrospection is an indecent as well as impossible thing to the spirit of this familyT o look into her soul and see the diseased and dead things that fill it is naturally impossible and naturally indecentDostoevsky calls man an animal who can get used to anythingAnd a man s adjustment to hideous things is not so final as a woman sFor the spirit of this family to reveal an honest reaction when it is contrary to the approved artificial demands of a situation is as heinous The Little Review an exhibition of bad taste as to uncover a thighBut luckilythis concealing of honest feeling is not often requiredThe spirit of this family is incapable in the main of honest feelingThat is a part of the beauty killed long ago in hera part of the beauty she killed in the daughtera part of the beauty the daughter will strangle in her own childrenAnd one of the compensations for dead souls is that they naturally feel dishonest feeling and do not have to suffer with a realization of hypocrisyThis family thinks of virtue in terms of legsThis family regards art and truth with a modulated leerIt is crudely cynical of everything outside its rangeIt sneers and pooh hoosit ostracizes and condemnsIt is vulgarly contemptuous of the factors in life superior to itThe spirit of this family would have shrieked in outrage at the presence of Verlaine in its home unless he could have reflected social distinction on itIt would have closed the doors to Ibsenexcept for the social distinctionto every triumphant soul that had escaped the dead fingers and realized itselfAnd by some inexplicable trick of self adjustment the spirit of this family looks upon thought as an undesirable affectationSocial success means to this family a speaking acquaintance with any wealthier unit which originally considered itselfabovethis familyMoral success means to this family an exemption from the prosecution of the forces it has reared for its own protection keeping out of jailout of scandal monging newspapersout of the malicious after dinner gossip of its friendsOf an evening you will find this family in the living roomThe husband and father reads a newspaperHe has worked in his office all day and is tiredLife long ago ceased to mean anything to himHe is an animal husk in fine linenHe has his little prejudices and his little conventionsIndeedhe is a part of the system of the unit but not much interested in itHe never was possessed of the capacity for beauty which his women folk once had and which they found it necessary to kill in each otherMan is a more natural part of the world s uglinessHe is coarser stuff in generalFor him it is not necessary to wage any struggleHe accepted matrimony because of a concentrated physical curiosity in one womanand because it was the thing to do at his ageLove suffered epeliptic dissolution in the nuptial couchHonor toward his woman expired when the mysteries of her flesh paledObedience is his natural state that islong ago he established a line of least resistance and inoculated his women folk with the fable that adherence to this line was the obedience and respect he owed themIf a latent instinct awakens suddenly in him he indulges himselfHe finds it rather difficult to be immoralbut as he hesitates a latent strength overcomes his fear and thus he is able to be immoral and unfaithful to his own convenient restrictions in a natural manner and with no great loss of sleepThe Little Review One man in ten thousand inherits the beauty of the woman who bore him and he becomes an artistIt is not necessary for him to revoltHis fathers have taken care of thatThere is an assured place in the world for him not in the living room here in front of the fireplace but elsewherein places of which poets sing The family man keeps postedHe knows what is going on in the world but does not understand itHe is not capable of understandingBut sometimes understanding and reason coincide with his prejudices and he is then as liable to hold minority views as notHe is drysometimes cleverBut always he jogsjogsjogs alongHe can even sleep night after night in the same bed with his wife without feeling annoyanceHis bluntedness is completeDostoevsky is rightHis wife and the mother of his children is a part of the furniture of existence for himIn his own way he is quite deadbut it was not necessary to kill himIf his son revolts the instinct of his mother is communicated to him and he fightsHe borrows the mother s weapons and he blasphemes in a half hearted way about the duty to parentsBut the beauty which the mother found easy to kill in the daughter usually discovers a hardier citadel in the son and usually he carries it safely into the worldThe room this living room is dimly andartisticallylightedThe fire in the grate glowsThe daughter sits in a corner speaking to a friendAt the other side sits the father reading blanklyThe wife entersShe surveys the scene from the doorway with a feeling of warm satisfactionShe comes in and sits downThey talk about nothingthey think about

music written for the piano will have in it a high concentration of clear color sound and that the new pianist will focus his technique to just one end to the clearest expression of this color sound identitySea mistfor instancehas certain colors and certain smells if you are keen sensed it has certain soundsYou may say it has been the aim of all composers and musicians to put nature into musicWellit has been the aim of most poets to put nature into poetrybut the Imagists have done ittheir medium is not only a more direct one the point is that they seem to have dispensed with a mediumTheir words don t merely convey color to you they are the colorThe new musician can do this and I believe he can do it on the piano better than on any other instrumentHis music will be all these

Little Review 13LawsonCaplanSchmidt ALEXANDER BERKMAN DON T know of anything more tragic and pitiful than the superstition thatJustice will triumph What this metaphysical conception ofjusticereally signifieshow it is to be expressed in applicable termsis impossible to determine in view of the multiplicity of individual antagonisms and class interestsBut somehow we all believe injusticeyet the criterion of each is the degree of the attainment of his own purposeFrom time immemorial we humans have been clamoring forjustice divine and earthlyHence our slaveryAnd Kaiser and Czar both claim justice on their sideand millions are slaughtering each other to attain the particular justice of their respective mastersIn this blessed land of oursjustice is ranked highand labor is constantly basing its appeals and demands on justiceBut perhaps let us hope the John Lawson case has somewhat jolted the popular faith in the metaphysical conceptionat least so far as it manifests itself in the Colorado courtsIt is safe to say that there is no intelligent man in that state who does not know that the stage for Lawson s conviction had been set long before his trialHe was an intelligentactive agitatorHe sought to crystallize the rebellious dissatisfaction of the miners into effective actionsufficient reason for the Rockefeller controlled state to eliminatemost emphaticallysuch an undesirable elementIn Coloradoas well as throughout the rest of the countrymost people know that a greatinjustice was done Lawson What are the people of Colorado doing about itNot a thingThe cheerful idiototherwise known as the good citizencares for justice only in the degree in which it affects his own pocketAnd the masses of labor who do feel themselve and their cause injured by the railroading of Lawson to prison they call the verdict amiscarriage of justiceapplaud Professor Brewster who wired LawsonUnbelievableCounsel friends keep coolJustice will be done And the people of Colorado remain inactivein the belief that the Supreme Courtthe Governoror maybe the Holy Ghost will see to it that justice is doneYet the Lawson lesson has not been entirely lostIt is possible that it has shed a light that will reflect itself on coming fights between labor and capitalIt is more than probable that the lesson has already borne fruit in the more aggressive attitude of labor in some parts of the countryIt has helped ever growing numbers to realize that to expectjusticein the struggle between labor and capital means to doom the toilers to defeat14 The Little Review It will be highly interesting to watch the effect of the Lawson outrage upon the approaching trial of David Caplan and Mathew Schmidtthe aftermath of the McNamara casein Los AngelesCaliforniaThe history of this case is illuminating of our legal and socialjusticeThe labor unions in California have for the last nine years fought a bitter fight against the Merchants and ManufacturersAssociationthe Western branch of the Steel TrustEvery meanslegal and illegalhas been used by the employers to exterminate the unions and paralyze the workersAnd they have practically succeeded in breaking every labor organization in the Steel Industry from New York to San FranciscoWhere twenty years ago we had a powerful union for instancein Pennsylvania the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workerstoday nothing but a pitiful remnant is leftOnly one union in the steel industry has survived the Structural Iron WorkersThey survived because they contested every inch of ground against the Merchants and ManufacturersAssociationThe result of that fight was a long war between capital and labor on the CoastEvery form of persecution and violence was used against laborand labor was forced to defend itselfIn consequence the Structural Iron Workers increased their wages from2 40 a day to4 40and reduced their hours from ten to eightOrganized capital resorted to every trick to strangle the workersand in Los Angeles a special law was passed prohibiting picketingBut the union defied the lawand five hundred men went to prison during the general strike of the metal trades in Southern California in 1910During this fight the Los Angeles Timesthe most relentless enemy of labor and of humanitywas destroyedThe brothers McNamara were arrestedas a resultand then the masters made the solemn promise that the war would be stopped and that all further prosecutions of labor men would cease if the McNamaras would plead guiltyIt was only on the strength of this promise that the McNamaras were finally induced to plead guiltyHardly ten days passedwhen the Merchants and ManufacturersAssociation broke every promise they madeThey began the prosecution oflabor men in Los Angeles and Indianapolisand did everything in theirpower to railroad to prison the most effective members of the unionsAnd nowfour and a half years laterthey have arrested David Caplan in Seattle and Mathew Schmidt in New Yorkand brought them across the country to Los Angeles to put them on trial for complicity with the McNamarasThis perfidious activity of organized capital has made labor in California realize that the courts are controlled by the employersand that labor cannot expect justiceThey now understand what a fatal mistake was made inthe case of John LawsonThe workers depended on the innocence of Lawson for his acquittalThey failed to actexpecting justice to be doneThe Little Review At least some of the labor elements on the Coast are awakening to the situationThey feel that they cannot expect justice from the courts of the exploitersThey have now determined that more aggressive and militant action is necessaryif labor is not to be submerged by the oppression of capitalThey are beginning to see that throughout the country the masters are picking out the most effective and intelligent fighters from the ranks of the workers and railroading them to prisonto terrorize labor and stifle the spirit of liberty and independenceThe Lawson casethe case of Ford and Suhrof Rangel and Clineof Joe Hilland the many other cases now pending in the courts of New York and elsewhereall show what capital intends to do to laborIs labor really going to keep quiet and submit to this persecution and slaveryThe unions on the Coast have determined that they will notThey are calling upon every one in sympathy with labor to join the great movement to stop the aggression of capitalThey have decided on strong militant tactics to defend the workingmanhis family and his union against the tyranny of the bossesThey have issued the call to every central bodyaffiliated unions and radical organizationsto join hands at this most critical momentThis is not a question of theory or of philosophic ismIt is the great war of labor against capitala struggle of life and deathIn this struggle all local and theoretic differences may be safely forgottenand all friends of labor make common causeI have been sent as a special delegate by some of the California unions to help organize the solidaric and militant forces of labor throughout the countryIt is evident how significant this case is for the workers in generalIt is imperative that they combine in solidaric unity in this vital matterto register in mighty accents the sentiments and determination of the oppressedThus were HaywoodMoyerand Pettibone torn from the clutches of the jungle beastThus were returned to liberty Ettor and GiovannittiCarlo Trescaand other fighters for the better dayBut whenever the workers failed to sound the tocsin of solidarity and make their gesture of protesttheir prisoners of war have invariably remained the hostages of the enemyOrganizations and individuals who are willing to give us

sunlight on his shoulders so wellhad such a natural love for the feel of light and air upon his bare flesh that he almost attained that high charm of forgetting himself half dressedThe country people occasionally come down to the water on the Sabbath or to sellfrom their homes back on the automoblie routes and the interurban linesand for what they do not get of the natural beauty of shore and bluffI have a fine respectHowever they didn t miss the Temporary MrPanThey complained that he was exposing himselfeven that he was shamelessNowI am no worshiper of nudityI d like to bebut it disappoints in most casesThere is always a strain about an object that is conscious of itself and that nudity which is unconscious of itself is either shamelessan inevitable point of its imperfection anatomically for the trained eyeor else it is touched with divinity and does not frequent these shoresThe human body has suffered the fate of all flesh and plant fiber that is denied lightA certain vision must direct all growth and vision requires lightThe covered things are white lidded and abortivescrawny from struggle or bulbous from the feeding dream into which they are prone to sinkIt will require centuries for the human race to outgrow the shameswhich have come to adhere to our character structure from recent generationsWe have brutalized our bodies with these thoughtsWe associate women with veils and secrecybut the trouble is not with themhas not come from womenbut from the male ordering of women s affairs to satisfy his own ideas of possession and conservationThe whole cycle of human production is a man arrangement according to present standards and every process is destructively bungledHoweverthat s a life workthat subjectThe thoughts of our ancestors have debased our bodies in color and texture and contour organically and to be seenNudity is not beautifuland does not play sweetly upon our minds because of this heritageThe human body is associated with darknessand the place of this association in our minds is of corresponding darknessThe young man and I talked it overWe decided that it would be athankless task for him to spend the summers in ardent endeavor to educate the Countryside by browning his back in publicThat did not appeal to us as a fitting life taskmoreoverhis project would be frequently interrupted by the town marshalAs a matter of truthone may draw most of the values of the actinic rays of the sun through thin white clothingand if one has not crushed his feet into a revolting mess in pursuit of the tradesmenhe may go barefooted a little while each day on his own grass plot without shocking the natives or losing his credit at the bankThe real reason for opening this subject is to expresswithout hatredcertain facts in the case of the Countryside which complainedThey are villagers and farm people who live with Mother Nature without knowing herThey look into the body of Naturebut never see her face to faceThe play of light and the drive of intelligence in her eyes is above the level of their gaze or too brightPotentially they have all the living lights the flame immortalbut it is turned lowIt does not glorify them as men or parents or workmenIt does not inspire them to questing man s real and most significant businessThey do not know that which is good and evil in foodin musicin colorfabricbooksin houseslands or faithThey live in a low lazy rhythm and attract unto themselves inevitably objects of corresponding vibrationOne observes this in their childrenin their schoolsand most pathetically in their churchesThey abide dimly in the midst of their imperfectionsbut with tragic peaceWhen their children revoltthey meet on every hand the hideous weight of matterthe pressure of low vibrationsand only the more splendid of them have the integrity of spirit to rise above the resistanceAs for the clothing they wearthey would do better if left suddenly naked as a people and without preconceptions were commanded to find some covering for themselvesAs herdsthey have fallen into a descending arc of usageunder the inevitable down pull of tradeWhere the vibrations of matter are lowits responsive movement is gregarianrather than individualThe year aroundthese people wear clothingwoolen pants and skirtswhich if touched with an irontouched with sunlightrain or any medium that arouses the slumbering quantitiesthe adjacent nostril is offendedThey are heavy eaters of meat the year roundThey slay their pets with as little concern as they gather strawberriesTheir ideas of virtue and legitimacy have to do with an ecclesiastical formas ancient as Nineveh and as effaced in meaningThey accept their childrenas one pays a price for pleasure and those children which come from their stolen pleasures are either murdered or marked with shameTheir idea of love is indefinite with desireand their love of children has to do with the sense of possessionThey are not significant men in their own fields rarely a good masona good carpentera good farmerthe many have not even found the secret of order and unfolding from the simplest taskThe primary meaning of the day s task in its relation to life and blessedness is not to be conceived by themThey are taught from childhood that first of all work is for breadthat bread perishestherefore one must pile up as he may the wherewith

way which each man must go alonebefore he begins to be erect in other than bone and sinewThey cover their bodies but they do not cover their faces nor their minds nor their soulsand this is the marvelthey are not ashamedThey reveal the emptiness of their faces and the darkness of their minds without complaining to each other or the policeFrom any standpoint of realitythe points of view of the many need only to be expressed to reveal their abandonment You seeI have left the Countryside and am lost in the crowd nowany crowdthe world crowdwhose gods today are tradepatriotism and a certain limp legged tumblerYet we are told by every authoritative voice out of the pastand we know it from the urge of our own soulsthat we must love the many before we can serve themIt is fatuous to love blindlytherefore we must understand what we are aboutI have touched here some small things of the crowdwhich are well enough to know otherwise we are apt to stand apart from the many crying How noble are the simple mindedHow sweet the people of the Countryside How inevitable and unerring is the voice of the peopleAs a matter of truthunless directed by some strong man s visionthe voice of the people has never yet given utterance to constructive truth and the same may be said of those who cater to the public taste in politics or the so called artsThe man who undertakes to give the people what the people want is not an artist or a true leader of any dimensionHe is a tradesman and finds his place in his generationThe brave workman who dares be himself and go hungry for the honor finds sooner or later a brilliant little fact rising in his consciousnessone that comes to stayand which future thinking must be built around that while the people are all that is low and bad in their change and rush of personalitythey are also the soil of the futurea splendid potential mass that contains every heroism and masterpiece to be that all great things must come from the peoplebecause

Ugliest ManGEORGE BURMAN FOSTER GOOD and evilthese are time old oppositesSo are beautiful and uglyBut these two opposites are seldom entirely coincidentNo doubt there are good and high class men who are commonly judged to be fundamentally uglyAnd there are blinding beauties who are on a war footing against all that we call goodThe good satisfies our moral judgmentthe beautifulour judgment of tasteThe one has to do with the content of human lifethe otherwith the formButat bottomthe moral judgment and the judgment of taste cannot remain entirely and materially dissociatedIt was a more nearly correct feeling on the part of the Greeks when they let the beautiful and the good inter growAccording to the Greekthe good and the beautifulintimately unitedconstitute the ideal of virtuehoweverWe are reconciled after a fashion to the ugliness of a man if we find a great and noble soul in the repellant shellBut if permanent beauty is to be preserved to human natureefficient and high endeavorfree self concentrated formation of character is the only means to this endWhen theouter manmirrors goodness and beauty of heartfirmness and bravery of willseriousness and depth of thoughthis countenance glows under all circumstances with a radiance of happy beautyand it would be a barbarian and pitiable eye indeed that could not apprehend such radiance or feel itself smitten with its gloryFor the man of fine feelingthereforeall that is ugly affects him morally at the same timeIndeedthe reproach of having behaved in an ugly manner he feels as keenlyfrequently more keenly in factthan the reproach of having behaved immorallyIn the case of Friedrich Nietzschethe moral criterion of human worth was totally transformed into an aesthetic criterion This man who had subdued allmoralityand left it behind himwho took his standbeyond good and evil submitted to a new evaluationwas measured according to his greatnessGreatness was nobilitysupremacybeautySmallness was vulgaritybasenessuglinessNot the wickedestand not the wretchedestbut the ugliest man der hässlichste Mensch represents the power which the new culture has to struggle with to overcomeindeed if man is to mount to a higher plane of beingWho is this ugliest manOf all the Zarathustrian enigmasthis is perhaps the most enigmaticIt must have been a frightful ugliness which haunted and harried the poet philosopher when he narrates thatamid his wanderings over men s disappointing earthhe had met the ugliest manThe Little Review 31 Many and many were the types of human beings that Zarathustra had met in his lonely pilgrimagesMost of them he disposed of with high scorn or honest contemptthus did he dispatch the good and reputablethe custodians of the old tables of morals and order thenthe preachers of the doctrine of equalitywho swarmed around like flies in market placesshunning all solitudesable to exist only in masses next the poisonous tarantulas whowith envious revengedevised punishmentsin cold blood dragged their victims to justicefinallythe wise and uprightthe schoolmasterswhose duress converted all depths into shallowsmanaged to obliterate all men s peculiaritiestill nothing distinctive was leftBut the ugliest man was uglier than any of theseThese types did not so infuriate Zarathustra as did the ugliest manAt all these Nietzsche shook his headbut they did not floor himHe had been able to look upon themto scold themto laugh at them And again did Zarathustra s feet run through mountains and forestsWhen the path curved round a rockall at once the landscape changedand Zarathustra entered into a realm of deathHere bristled aloft black and red cliffswithout any grasstreeor bird s voiceFor it was a valley which all animals avoidedeven the beasts of preyexcept that a species of uglythickgreen serpent came here to die when they became oldTherefore the shepherds called this valleySerpent death Here Zarathustra found the ugliest man something sitting by the wayside shaped like a manand yet hardly like a mansomething nondescriptAnd all at once there came over Zarathustra a great shamehe blushed up to the roots of his white hairhe would flee this ill starred place the worst that there was in the whole world But the Great Despiserthe Hater of all pity was himself so unstrung and overpowered by pity that he sank down all at oncelike a giant oak that had weathered many a stormor withstood many a stroke of the woodman s axeWho was this ugliest manWhat was this ugliest thing which Nietzsche the great man spy and life appraiser had ever discovered in a human beingBefore Nietzsche wrotethus spake Zarathustrahe expresses himself in another work as followsNothing is ugly save the degenerate manFrom the physical standpoint everything ugly weakens and depresses manIt reminds of decaydangerimpotencehe literally loses strength in its presenceThe effect of ugliness may be gauged by the dynamometerWhenever man s spirits are downcastit is a sign that he scents the proximity of somethingugly His feeling of powerhis will to powerhis courage and his pride these things collapse at the sight of what is uglyand rise at the sight of what is beautifulUgliness is understood to signify a hint or a symptom of degenerationthat which reminds ushoweverremotely of degeneracyimpels us to the judgmentugly Every sign of exhaustionof gravityof ageof fatigue every kind of constraintsuch as crampor paralysis and above all the smellscolors and forms associated with decomposition and putrefactionThe Little Review however much they may havebeen attenuated into symbolsall these things provoke the same reactionwhich is the judgmentugly A certain hatred expresses itself herewho is it that man hatesWithout a doubt it is the decline of his typeIn this regard his hatred springs from the deepest instinct of the raceThere is horrorcautionprofundityand far reaching vision in this hatredit is the most profound hatred that exists Nowhere has Nietzsche told us of the zenithwho his superman isBut he here tells us of the nadirwho the ugliest man is and the superman is the exact and august oppositeThus we could ourselves construct his supermanBut the ugliest man we recognize this strange figure of the Zarathustra poesy in the sharp cry of distress which all representatives of degeneratede generahumanity groan out where the yearning toward a higher humanity overpowers themThe ugliest man then appears accoutered with a crown with which he has crowned his own headand with two purple girdles which encircle himIn a later profound observationNietzsche informs us that the ugliest man is called der historische Sinnthe historical mindor sensewhich needs decorationaccoutrementlike all ugly things that would make themselves tolerableat least for surface peopleThe degenerate manthis is the ugly manand the saddest degeneration is the surrender of life to the past for the past is the big grave which swallows up all that livesWhoever makes the past the goal of his longing walks among corpses which make him shiverHe becomes himself a corpsewhose society is freezing for living menAnd because this manassimilated to the pastliving in the pastis nothing himselfhe needs all kinds of fiddlefaddle to give himself the semblance of being somethingHe needs pomp which makes a world stirring phenomenon out of a coronation he scrambles and scratches after titles and orders which long ago Frederick the Greatthe philosopher king on the Prussian thronecalled the insignia of fools he has himself accredited by father and grandfatherso that their merit may adorn the shield of son and grandson in a wordhe reverses the counsel of an apostle Forgetting the things that are behind for he forgets the things that are before and reaches back for the things that arebehindAnd because there is for this backward bent man an inconvenient monitor and witness of all life because there is Godthe omnipresent Godwho ever sees alleven sees man through and throughthis ugliest man became the murderer of Godhe took revenge on the living God for being witness of the hiddenest life of man I know thee well said Zarathustrawith a brazen voice thou are the murderer of GodThou couldst not endure him who beheld thee through and throughthou ugliest manThou tookest revenge on this witness We have hereI thinkwith all that is enigmatic and obscurea sharply outlined picture of the ugliest manEarlier Nietzsche wrote a book on the blessing and the bane of history for lifeIn that book he accorded right to The Little Review 33 historical culture and to man s knowledge of the past only in so far as the life of the man of the present and of the future would be advanced therebyBut the historians in the schoolsin chair and pulpitdid not so thinkThey acknowledged life only when it was dead A zealous teacher of history was a meandering mummy from out the pastwho had no blood more in his veinsno flesh more on his bonesTherefore was he so uglyTherefore did he create such a frosty temperature round about himUnder the pressure of these historical forcesall life became a cultus of the pastThe older a thing wasthe better it wasIt was the long pastthe outlivedthat was nobleThe more remote that pastthe prouder men were of itand the brighter shone its glory beaming star to the eyes of menFrom this malady of the ugliest manfrom this de genera tionwe are by no means freeInstead of ascent to a higher genus than present manto supermanthere is descent to a lower genusThis antiquarianhoary spirit pervades our whole social lifethis re spect for what has become old and rottenfor what can show no other merit than that it once was It is a sign of our own decaythis living on the deadthis ability only to resuscitate and copy past centuries past poetrypast artpast philosophypast moralitypast religion this knowing in consequence no life of our very ownWe buildwhitewashed sepulchersin our livesbecause we have no courage of heart to create anything that belongs to lifeAt all eventsthat the putridity and the dead bones may be concealedwe use whitewashmuch whitewash W e use decorationsbrilliantfinely painted decorations so that men may not observe that life has become a theatrical playmaking an impression indeed under clever managementbut inspiring no living human heartAll the splendor of this pompwhich we of today employ on the stage of lifecannot conceal the chilly vacuity of this whole business and the man who peers behind the curtains and sees how people look shorn of their decorationswithout powder and paintwithout the artificial cunning luminosity of the day s pufferyhas Zarathustra s feeling in the valley forsaken to the old green thick snake on its way to dieZarathustra s feeling when he met the ugliest manwhere much heaviness settled on his mindbecause he did not think that anything so ugly and horrible could exist among menYesthere are traces and traits of this ugliest man among usIf we but imagine all that is decorationflummerystripped off from usthink how much degenerate life would be disclosed How much love for the dead that no longer liveshow much bitter strife and war over reliquesover some sacred cloakor sacred boneof which history narratestelling us that they once belonged to lifeHow much slavish obedience to thoughts that once were to institutions that once served the livingTo be suremen call this pietyand have thus designed a beautiful robe behind which they hide their moribund livesFor the sake of this pietythey exact consideration for all ancient dust which burden the homes and hearts of menthey arm them34 The Little Review selves against him whowith mighty handwould undertake a huge housecleaning of life and for lifePietyit is this that they call admiration and veneration of every idol which for long has been played outbut still counts us of today among its devoteesMen must even deal God a mortal blowthe Living God of the livingandwith the ferocious hatred of their follypursue the God who sees their innermost heart as a living witness of what they would like to hide from themselves and all the world But hehad to die he looked with eyes which beheld everythinghe beheld men s depths and dregsall his hidden ignominy and uglinesshe crept into my dirtiest cornersThis most pryingover intrusiveover pitiful one had to dieHe even beheld me on such a witness I would have revenge or not live myselfThe God who beheld everythingand also manthat God had to die Man cannot endure it that such a witness should live Thus spake the ugliest manZarathustra started offfeeling frozen to the very bowelsThe God who told men that altogether they served deathnot lifethat they worked deteriorationnot rejuvenation had to dieLife is a dyingand yet there shoots through the heart of man such a nameless anxiety in the presence of this dying that he paints up and pencils all death till it looks like lifeAnd indeed many are deceivedmany see only men s rouge and mark not the great lie which it hidesThis is the ugliest thing in the worldand it made the prophet of a new culture shudder and freezethisthat we live and walk among corpses which yet look as if they were aliveTo fight and conquer this hindrance to a new culturethis is to fight and conquer death and since death is death only through manthrough his yearning or fearthe triumph of a new culture begins with the triumphal song of lifewhich knows how to make a festival out of even deathTo be sureNietzsche did not set his most beautiful man over against his most uglybut we can yet read between the lines what he conceived the most beautiful man to beHe is the man who has pushed far from him the last vestige and survival of fear and slave serviceHe is the man who has learned dying as the great Consummatorvictorioussurrounded by men who hope and vow that there shall ever be festival where a man who so dies dedicates himself to the livingHere Zarathustra Nietzsche intimates a kinship with that other Dying Man Who proclaimed his life s victorious career in His It is finished and created on Christianity s Good Friday a festival of deathNietzsche speaks of the Hebrewtoo early deadwho would have confessed Zarathustra s doctrineif he had attained to Zarathustra s yearsIt did not occur to Nietzsche that such a confession was not at all neededbecause the world had perceived the glad message already which would make a festival out of death and teach men how the most beautiful festival was consecratedChristian art had opposed to the ugliest man the most beautiful human picturethe head full of wounds The Little Review 35 and bloodthe King in the thorn crownwho understood dying because he understood livingWith this victorious song of death began a new culturea new heroism of humanityto which death ceased to be a pale ghostbut which confessed even in deathas dyingand beholdwe liveThen men ceased to learn dyingand because they made no preaching of life out of dying and no vow to lifedeath became to them a torturing anxiety and care again they did not dare name his name they did not dare frankly look him in the eyeAnd this cowardice and lie disfigure all their action and passion they would give to death at least the semblance of life they would believe in ghostly existence still allotted to all the deadrather than say to deathThou are a messenger of Goda revelationa witness of life since thou art goodI will greet thee and bless thee So Zarathustra demanded of his disciples Let your dying be no blasphemy of men and earth my friendsyour spirit and your virtue shall still glow in your dyinglike the evening red over the earthor else death has miserably betrayed you Death our will evenour freedom this is life s highest meaningWho but Nietzsche could have thought thatOf coursethis is not to throw life awaywhen it has become hard and heavy to bearSuch a death would be of all the most unfreeIt would be a flightnot a deed it would be a lamentation and a feeblenessnot a festival of the soul But it means that we take up death from the start into the order of our lifeas the night whichno less than the daybelongs to man s full dayIt means that we give to life a worth which no death can destroywhich first in death reveals its eternal powerI must die so laments the slavewho has lived only nonentities even in his lifeand has never learned that life is workcreationconsummationI will die so speaks the heroto whom every fight brings the prize of a victory well worth death the hero who hazards his life every moment for the highest human goodwho knows that he and his life have become a sacrifice from which a betterhigherfreer humanity shall gain its life and its strengthWho is uglyWho is beautifulWho is ashamed of his death and falsifies his deadness that it may look like life who does thisbears death within himself as a power that drags him downdisfigures him in the fullness of that which he would be able to liveBut whoin his power to dieproves that he has learned to livehas overcome the ugliest thing in mancast it outnamelythe fear of death which creates all the lies of lifeand all the servility and unfreedom of men which creates men over whom das Gewesenthe dead pastpossesses powerso that they can never breathe a joyous breathcan never commit themselves to the living and the growingBut a beautiful culture will also become a good culture because one that is living is at once good and beautiful the eternal life of Godof whom it is said There is none good but God alone36 The Little Review Emasculating IbsenDEAR MRIBSEN I hope this letter finds you well as it leeves us the sameThe reason why I write you is that I seen your play called Ghosts at the Bijou Movie Theater last night and I thought it was so grand that I had to tell youI thought it was awful the way poor MrAlving is always seeing that hand which was pulling his hair out of the pastAnd it was awful too the way poor MrAlving crawled across the floor on his stomich and pulled the poison offn the icebox before he killed himselfThe way his poordear mother sufferedthat was terribleShe was such a strongbrave woman that I cried for her all the timeAnd The RevManders he was such a real swell minister that my heart was all torn watching himIt ain t natural for everybody to be so good as ministers because they ain t got so much time and don t read the Bible so oftenBut he was certainly all there when it came to pureness and kindnessBut even if the play was awful it was just grand the lesson that it taughtI sent my friend to see it and he thought it was swellHe said the kissing scenes where the terrible CapAlving hugs the different ladies was real stuff and that the lesson against the evils of drink was good for the youngThis is what I want to write you aboutMrIbsenWe re going to organize a West Side Ibsen Prohibition Club and make you honary presidentI wish therefor you will write the club a letter or better if you will write a sequil to the movie play Ghosts we will put it on at the clubI know how hard it is to have movie plays accepted because I have done some myself but if you don t write the sequil I will write it and send it to the Mutual people who put the first part onI am certain they will take it because I will make it just so strong and powerful a sermon against the evils of drink as what you didWith best regards and hopes for your future successI am your friendMobbie Mag PSFor the reader The wet nurses who minister to the mob have

CompanyThere is considerable diversity in Mr Fletcher s Irradiationsbut one soon discovers that he has not encrimsoned himself with the standard griefand fearSome persons havethereforefound him aloofoversubtleand lacking in emotional forceThis intimation that Mr Fletcher s art isetiolated is an admission of the reader s incompletenessVitality does not depend on subjectnor is subtlety necessarily weaknessBut the notion strangely persists that a poet must clothe his emotions in samite and dance with them around a blood red fire to the plangent accompaniment of drums and trumpetsTo say that MrFletcher has entwined himself with nature would in many of his poems is a part of the rainof the sand and windof the clouds and skyBut he is never merely descriptiveHe has the power of conveying a mood in the terms of nature without intruding himself upon the readerLet me illustrate with one of the best of his poems which has been much quoted elsewhereFlickering of incessant rain flashing pavementsscurry of umbrellasrecurved blossoms of the storm The winds came clanging and clattering long white highroads whipping in ribbons up summitsstrew upon the city gusty wafts of apple blossomd the rustling of innumerable translucent leaves Uneven tinklingthe lazy rain from the eaves Our tread mill versifiers will shrink and mumble in the presence of MrFletcher s clean new poetryThey who have inherited the dead mottled skin of old poetic form with its incrustation of ancient allusionssymbolsand yellowed figureswill not feel the alluring freshness of a poem such as thisIt is eveningand the earth her shoulders in an old blue shawlthere clink the polychrome points of the starsafter all these yearsupon earth there is lifeand then deathand later nightfall 44 The Little Review Fireand the quenching of emberswhy should I not remember that my night is dawn in another partof the worldIf the idea fits my fancyDawns of marvellous lightwakefulsleepywearydancing dawnsYou are rose petals settling through the blue of my eveningI light my pipe to salute youAnd sit puffing smoke in the air and never say a wordIn his preface MrFletcher says the use of rhyme is in its essence barbarousyet he himself uses it not infrequently together with such devices as assonanceonomatopoeiaand alliterationHe is not inconsistenthoweverfor he admits that rhyme used intelligently will add to the richness of effectIt doesThe wind that drives the fine dry sand the strandsad wind spinning arabesques a wrinkled handLabyrinths of shifting sanddancing dunesI will arise and run with

pipingstamping of drunken feetflutteringtattered broidery flung the dunessteep escarpments The fine dry sand that whistles the long low beaches Sand and Spray A Sea Symphony comprises the second part of MrFletcher s volumeThis symphony has much of the movement and variety of musicIn manner it resembles many of theIrradiations and it is just as well worth readingCertainly there will be many who will not like MrFletcher s workDogs will always bark at a new fragrance Japanese Lyricstranslated by Lafcadio Hearn Houghton Mifflin Company Readers of Lafcadio Hearn will recall the many translations of Japanese haikai poetry which are scattered through his writingsThose translations have been collected in the present volumeThey are delicate whisps of thoughttantalizingly suggestivemost of them

impatient withpeo puljust to the extent that our realization of superiority fails usThat impatient attitude reminds me of the ordinary attitude of the white toward the blackThe white man is not sure of himself history and biology do not give him sufficient supportSo he bullies negroes at every opportunitySome men even are impelled to contend for their superiority by abusing dogsThe sense of

beauty like that of thesadsweet music of humanity What is the glow of the most gorgeous sunset ever splashed against the western skies beside the glow of the divine in the human which hurls itself upon you and into you if you will let it in a thousand beseechinginvitingintoxicating flames from the midst of any crowdBut onlyof courseif you are in the midstIs there any adventure like theadventure of being humanand with humansand of them Go with Whitman into the heart of humanity struggle with themnot from far above them to lift from off their backs the crushing weight of wealth and masters and idle snobs and false gods so that they may get room to spread their wings for they have wingsand then you will know them as they areand yourself but as one of themIf some of them still try to clip the wings of those who have struggled free from the crushing pressureit is because of the maddening agony of their own atrophying wingsIf a few seem even to be unaware of the need for wingsit is because the clamor of more insistent needs the cries of hungry childrenof bruised and broken and unsatisfied men and of suffering and degraded women has silenced for every shame their own soul s wing cryBut I think that you will find that those who perform the wing clipping are the other butterflies whom money or position or callousness has set above the peoplenot those who are really of the crowdThey of the crowd love wingsand those who truly use themI am not daring to attempt reply to the statement which inflames me mostlest I become profane and entirely incoherentI meanof coursethe statement that the estimate of four or five thousand living artists would be too optimistic because thatwould mean four or five thousand whohave nothing in common with caterpillars That s a worse libel on artists than the rest of it is on peopleBut I ll try to stopwith one remark and one questionThe estimate is entirely too pessimistic I positively refuse to believe there are four thousand persons alive who have or even who think they havenothing in commonwith the great splendid mass of folks if therearethe gods have pity on themAnd has there ever been one single real and great artistwhether of brush or pen or tonewhose art and whose very greatness was not absolutely dependent upon and because of the fact that he hadand knew he hadeverything in common withand indeed included in his beingthe beings of these whom you termcaterpillarsthese whose life and living are and always have been and through ages will continue to be the most worth while content of all artOf course you replyNietzschebut he was

crime which demanded immediate retributionCertainly the law did not come out unscathed from this controversyIt is a familiar storybut it will bear repetition until it is remedied we are very much behind England in our administration of criminal lawThe efficiency of punishment as a deterrent to crime is largely based upon the swiftness and sureness of justice rather than the severity of the penalty inflictedBecker is deadbut who can deny that whatever social effect may result from his execution would have been trebled had his death come within a reasonable interval after the commission of his crimeThe case is significantnot because it is an exceptionbut because it is typical of the process of American lawStatement of OwnershipManagementCirculationEtc required by the Act of August
