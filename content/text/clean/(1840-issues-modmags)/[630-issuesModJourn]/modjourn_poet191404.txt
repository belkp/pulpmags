hill side  The Cyclists  Seeming dark plumaged Birds after carrion Careening and circling Over the dying  Of England  She lies with her bosom Beneath them no longer The Dominant Mother The Virile but rotting  Before time   The smell of her tainted Has bitten their nostrils Exultant they hover And shadow the sun with  Foreboding  TH E FOREIGNER  Have at you you Devils My back s to this tree For you re nothing so nice That the hind side of me Would escape your assault Come on now all three  Here s a dandified gentleman Rapier at point And a wrist which whirls round Like a circular joint A spatter of blood man That s just to anoint  And make supple your limbs Tis a pity the silk Of your waistcoat is stained  Why Your heart s full of milk And so full it spills over I m not of your ilk   The  You said so and laughed At my old fashioned hose At the cut of my hair At the length of my nose T o carve it to pattern I think you propose  Your pardon young Sir But my nose and my sword Are proving themselves In quite perfect accord grieve to have spotted Your shirt On my word  And hullo You Bully That blade s not a stick To slash right and left And my skull is too thick To be cleft with such cuffs Of a sword Now a lick  Down the side of your face What a pretty red line Tell the taverns that scar Was an honor Don t whine That a stranger has marked you  The tree s there You Swine   Did you think to get in At the back while your friends Made a little diversion In front So it ends With your sword clattering down On the ground Tis amends  I make for your courteous Reception of me A foreigner landed From over the sea Your welcome was fervent I think you ll agree  My shoes are not buckled With gold nor my hair Oiled and scented my jacket s Not satin I wear Corded breeches wide hats And I make people stare  So I do but my heart Is the heart of a man And my thoughts cannot twirl In the limited span Twixt my head and my heels As some other men s can   The Foreigner  have business more strange Than the shape of my boots And my interests range From the sky to the roots Of this dung hill you live in You half rotted shoots  Of a mouldering tree Here s at you once more You Apes You Jack fools You can show me the door And jeer at my ways But you re pinked to the core  And before I have done I will prick my name in With the front of my steel And your lily white skin Shall be printed with me For I ve come here to win   A LADY  You are beautiful and faded Like an old opera tune Played upon a harpsichord Or like the sun flooded silks Of an eighteenth century boudoir In your eyes Smoulder the fallen roses of outlived minutes And the perfume of your soul Is vague and suffusing With the pungence of sealed spice jars Your half tones delight me And I grow mad with gazing At your blent colours  My vigor is a new minted penny Which I cast at your feet Gather it up from the dust That its sparkle may amuse you  MUSIC  The neighbor sits in his window and plays the flute From my bed I can hear him And the round notes flutter and tap about the room And hit against each other Blurring to unexpected chords   Music  It is very beautiful With the little flute notes all about me In the darkness  In the daytime The neighbor eats bread and onions with one hand And copies music with the other He is fat and has a bald head So I do not look at him But run quickly past his window There is always the sky to look at Or the water in the well  But when night comes and he plays his flute  I think of him as a young man With gold seals hanging from his watch  And a blue coat with silver buttons As I lie in my bed The flute notes push against my ears and lips  And I go to sleep dreaming  THE BUNGLER  You glow in my heart Like the flames of uncounted candles But when I go to warm my hands My clumsiness overturns the light And then I stumble Against the tables and chairs   ANTICIPATION  I have been temperate always But I am like to be very drunk With your coming There have been times I feared to walk down the street Lest I should reel with the wine of you And jerk against my neighbors As they go by I am parched now and my tongue is horrible in my mouth But my brain is noisy With the clash and gurgle of filling wine cups  A GIFT  See I give myself to you Beloved My words are little jars For you to take and put upon a shelf Their shapes are quaint and beautiful And they have many pleasant colors and lustres To recommend them Also the scent from them fills the room With sweetness of flowers and crushed grasses  When I shall have given you the last one You will have the whole of me But I shall be dead   THE FORSAKEN  Holy Mother of God merciful Many Hear me I am very weary I have come from a village miles away all day I have been coming and I ache for such far roaming I cannot walk as light as I used and my thoughts grow confused I am heavier than I was Mary Mother you know the cause  Beautiful Holy Lady take my shame away from me Let this fear be only seeming let it be that I am dreaming For months I have hoped it was so now I am afraid I know Lady why should this be shame just because I haven t got his name He loved me yes Lady he did and he couldn t keep it hid We meant to marry Why did he die  That day when they told me he had gone down in the avalanche and could not be found until the snow melted in Spring I did nothing I could not cry Why should he die Why should he die and his child live His little child alive in me for my comfort No Good God for my miser I cannot face the shame to be a mother and not married and the poor child to be reviled for having no father Merciful Mother Holy Virgin take away this sin I did Let the baby not be Only take the stigma off of me  I have told no one but you Holy Mary My mother would call me whore and spit upon me the priest would have me repent and have the rest of my life spent in a convent I am no whore no bad woman he loved me and   we were to be married I carried him always in my heart what did it matter if I gave him the least part of me too You were a virgin Holy Mother but you had a son you know there are times when a woman must give all There is some call to give and hold back nothing I swear I obeyed God then and this child who lives in me is the sign What am I saying He is dead my beautiful strong man I shall never feel him caress me again This is the only baby I shall have Oh Holy Virgin protect my little baby My little helpless baby  He will look like his father and he will be as fast a runner and as good a shot Not that he shall be no scholar neither He shall go to school in winter and learn to read and write and my father will teach him to carve so that he can make the little horses and cows and chamois out of white wood Oh no no no How can I think such things I am not good My father will have nothing to do with my boy I shall be an outcast thing Oh Mother of our Lord God be merciful take away my shame Let my body be as it was before he came No little baby for me to keep underneath my heart for those long months T o live for and to get comfort from I cannot go home and tell my mother She is so hard and righteous She never loved my father and we were born for duty not for love I cannot face it Holy Mother take my baby away Take away my little baby I don t want it I can t bear it   The Forsaken  And I shall have nothing nothing Just be known as a good girl Have other men want to marry me whom I could not touch after having known my man Known the length and breadth of his beautiful white body and the depth of his love on the high Summer Alp with the moon above and the pine needles all shiny in the light of it He is gone my man I shall never hear him or feel him again but I could not touch another I would rather lie under the snow with my own man in my arms  So I shall live on and on Just a good woman With nothing to warm my heart where he lay and where he left his baby for me to care for I shall not be quite human I think Merely a stone dead creature They will respect me What do I care for respect You didn t care for people s tongues when you were carrying our Lord Jesus God had my man give me my baby when he knew he was going to take him away His lips will comfort me his hands will soothe me All day I will work at my lace making and all night I will keep him warm by my side and pray the blessed Angels to cover him with their wings Dear Mother what is it that sings I hear voices singing and lovely silver trumpets through it all They seem just on the other side of the wall Let me keep my baby Holy Mother He is only a poor lace maker s baby with a stain upon him but give me strength to bring him up to be a man  Amy Lowell   ALADDIN AND THE JINN  Bring me soft song said Aladdin This tailor shop sings not at all Chant me a word of the twilight Of roses that mourn in the fall Bring me a song like hashish That will comfort the stale and the sad For I would be mending my spirit Forgetting these days that are bad Forgetting companions too shallow Their quarrels and arguments thin Forgetting the shouting muezzin I am your slave said the Jinn  Bring me old wines said Aladdin I have been a starved pauper too long Serve them in vessels of jade and of shell Serve them with fruit and with song Wines of pre Adamite Sultans Digged from beneath the black seas New gathered dew from the heavens Dripped down from Heaven s sweet trees Cups from the angels pale tables That will make me both handsome and wise For I have beheld her the Princess Firelight and starlight her eyes Pauper I am I would woo her   Aladdin and the Jinn  And  let me drink wine to begin Though the Koran expressly forbids it 1 am your slave said the Jinn  Plan me a dome said Aladdin That is drawn like the dawn of the moon When the sphere seems to rest on the mountains Half hidden yet full risen soon Build me a dome said Aladdin That shall cause all young lovers to sigh The fulness of Life and of Beauty Peace beyond peace to the eye A palace of foam and of opal Pure moonlight without and within Where I may enthrone my sweet lady I am your slave said the Jinn Nicholas Vachel Lindsay   EASTER  The air is like a butterfly With frail blue wings The happy earth looks at the sky And sings  Joyce Kilmer  THE NIGHT SKY  O mystic delicate chalice of the world Jeweled with pallid moons Exquisite arch Of the quiet sky carven twixt dusk and dusk Of smoky Indian jade a summer night By God the Artist God the deaf and blind Who fashions masterpiece on masterpiece And through the Window of the Universe Hurls them forever and forever Pale cup wherein all tears and mirth of men Distil that men may drink of thee and live Thrice precious Grail that holds the Wine of Earth 1  John Reed   LYRA VERNALIS  Oft have I seen you lovely as of old Though Winter still forbade your birds to sing Steal by the silent houses barred to cold Around a sunlit corner vanishing With hooded face and mantle gray few know How in these peopled days you pass With hesitant comings hastenings away Through every street by every stretch of grass From wood to distant wood where er you go  To gaze upon some frozen spot And bid the frost depart Of many a gentle thing to feel the heart Judging the days before that pulse shall leap Fresh out of sleep  Sudden awake T o glow and merrymake In tune with the gay measure of its lot  So have I waited long today for sure This happy sun this wealth of southern air This desolation made by sleep more pure This emptiness will tempt you forth to fare  And earth will wake once more Now is the first sweet respite of the year Too long too long have you been stranger here Too long you tarry now so soon before   New storms with freshened force will rage O Spring what keeps you now When every tree when every naked bough  Needs your assurance when all spent things wait In fear which but your coming would assuage Spring Spring be not too late  The trodden soil conceals no trace of you Whose footprint I could tell in any place And yet methought that maid with raiment blue Who fled so fast had a familiar face  Some look of youth the Winter failed to heed Perhaps and now yon sapling is more green What laughter is it from what source unseen  Came that low mocking shout Behold a steed  Leaps as if happy to be driven Along the winged way Oh am I mad or did his driver gay  Lean from that dirty cart to wave farewell A finger to her lips as warning given Lest I her secret tell  Across wet meadows where the wild thyme sleeps Where lonely pools are forming in the sedge I fain would track you past the ice hung steeps Along the sinuous river s melting edge  To where alone there is a little hollow A slender streamlet trickles from the ground And stooping over it you gaze around   Lyra Vernalis  To see what charmed thing perchance may follow There kneeling on the early mud At last O Spring at last Would I might come upon you silently My arm about your shivering shoulders passed My hand beneath the head thrown back for me For me the breast a flower in every bud The eyes of ecstasy  Why must your journey in such desperate haste Without another curious glance behind There is a promise in this barren waste And from that southern way you went the wind  Brings an old fragrance back to things bereft Of all old fragrances Alas too soon Fall the long shadows of the afternoon  With fingers deft Dusk lights the stars in heaven s pale gulf of blue Where where are you Who should on earth make the sky s vision true  Now even have you sought that couch you left  Where when clouds ominously rise Dreaming you may forget How late will bloom the timid violet  Or on some quiet height perhaps you stand To view afar with passion laden eyes The desolated land  Arthur Johnson    THE HOUSE OF TAKUMI  POEM SEQUENCE FROM THE JAPANESE  Hidden Builders  I built for myself an abode that was planned of materials  only Carefully choosing each hollow bamboo But spirit things also wove themselves into it twining like  tendrils through lattices Distilling their atmospheres finer than air not fashioned for breathing Unseen and unguessed by the workmen they too were the builders and weavers Endlessly weaving  Hoarded Love  House I have loved with a love like that of a man for a  woman Love like an ether now clasps you and folds you House I have blessed with a blessing like that of father for  daughter Back from your walls as I gazed open eyed at the midnight Blessings returned like the voices persistent of temple bells  ringing Clearer than silver   The House of Takumi  Love Reflected  The Buddha blessed the bread before he brake the loaf And gave to his disciples For soulless things are sensitive to love They gather hoard and then in kind return They thrill with gathered and reflected love Vibrating bell like  Heredity  I dreamed a dream about a living house Pulsing and throbbing Perplexed I climbed its ancient way of stairs To find within its teeming haunted brain All moving shapes that there had lived or died Endlessly living  Coming Generations  Before the dawn birds sang uncertain little feet Frequently pattered On floors that claimed no echo from the listening walls The sleepers on their white beds stirred and thrilled But did not hear the childish phantom feet Beating their music  Desire for Children  The morning birds had ceased their first light greeting song And flown for food and water Before I knew I dreamed of children never born   O little feet so musical upon the stairs O little voices speaking in the inner ear Foolishly dreaming  Waters of Bitterness  I think my heart will smother me Beating against my side For within the room above Surrounded by those who can not help Languishes one I love Patiently suffering  Passing Generations  The wind sings in the chimney Breathing where it will Doors stand open and close again silently A great peace broods under the many roofs The walls listening vainly for footsteps Seem to be waiting  The Flow of Time  Long have I waited for the spring Praying for time to pass Now the cherry trees are white like snow And violets are blue in the fields But well I know that they who made it spring Are not returning   The House of Takumi  The House of Quietness  The wind sings in the chimney Rising and dying The stillness of the empty house is a persistent voice 1 hear its sibilant whisper like the waters of a sea For hours I lie and listen to the waves of silence Ceaselessly breaking  Opened Windows  Have mind and heart like children been deceived Grasping at shadows For still they whisper that they infinitely love And feel that they are infinitely loved And this they always knew yet never comprehended Until the voice of the essential silence Whispered its secret  The Time of Blossom  And the unplanted vines have grown and spread Filling the lattices The living walls are gay with crowded bloom The little footsteps patter down the walks And little voices fill the fragrant halls Laughing and loving  A J Russell   T O CELIA  I CONSUMMATION  There was a strangeness on your lips Lips that had been so sure You still were mine but in eclipse Beside me but obscure  There was a cloud upon your heart For Celia where you lay Death come to break your life apart Had led your love away  Through the cold distance of your eyes You could no longer see But when you died you heard me rise And followed suddenly  And close beside me looking down As I did on the dead You made of time a wedding gown Of space a marriage bed  I took in you death for a wife You married death in me Singing There is no other life  No other God than we   To Celia  II DURING A CHORALE BY CESAR FRANCK  In an old chamber softly lit  We heard the Chorale played And where you sat an exquisite Image of Life and lover of it  Death sang a serenade  I know now Celia what you heard  And why you turned and smiled It was the white wings of a bird Offering flight and you were stirred  Like an adventurous child  Death sang O lie upon your bier  Uplift your countenance Death bade me be your cavalier Called me to march and shed no tear  But sing to you and dance  And when you followed lured and led  By those mysterious wings And when I heard that you were dead I could not weep I sang instead  As a true lover sings  Today a room is softly lit I hear the Chorale played   And where you come an exquisite Image of death and lover of it Life sings a serenade  III SONGS ASCENDING  Love has been sung a thousand ways  So let it be The songs ascending in your praise Through all my days  Are three  Your cloud white body first I sing  Your love was heaven s blue And I a bird flew carolling In ring on ring  Of you  Your nearness is the second song  When God began to be And bound you strongly right or wrong With his own thong  T o me  But oh the song eternal high  That tops these two You live forever you who die I am not I  But you Witter Bynner  COMMENTS AND REVIEWS  POETRY S BANQUET  T the dinner given in honor of Mr William  Butler Yeats by the guarantors contributors  and editors of POETRY in the rooms of the  Cliff Dwellers Chicago on the evening of  March first the Irish poet took occasion to  warn his confreres in America against a number of besetting sins He said in part  Twenty five years ago a celebrated writer from South Africa said she lived in the East End of London because only there could she see the faces of people without a mask To this Oscar Wilde replied that he lived in the West End because nothing interested him but the mask After a week of lecturing I am too tired to assume a mask so I will address my remarks especially to a fellow craftsman For since coming to Chicago I have read several times a poem by Mr Lindsay one which will be in the anthologies General Booth Enters Into Heaven This poem is stripped bare of ornament it has an earnest simplicity a strange beauty and you know Bacon said There is no excellent beauty without strangeness   I have lived a good many years and have read many writers When I was younger than Mr Lindsay and was beginning to write in Ireland there was all around me the rhetorical poetry of the Irish politicians We young writers rebelled against that rhetoric there was too much of it and to a great extent it was meaningless When I went to London I found a group of young lyric writers who were also against rhetoric We formed the Rhymers Club we used to meet and read our poems to one another and we tried to rid them of rhetoric  But now when I open the ordinary American magazine I find that all we rebelled against in those early days the sentimentality the rhetoric the moral uplift still exist here Not be   cause you are too far from England but because you are too far from Paris  It is from Paris that nearly all the great influences in art and literature have come from the time of Chaucer until now Today the metrical experiments of French poets are overwhelming in their variety and delicacy The best English writing is dominated by French criticism in France is the great critical mind  The Victorian forgot this also they forgot the austerity of art and began to preach When I saw Paul Verlaine in Paris he told me that he could not translate Tennyson because he was too Anglais too noble when he should be broken hearted he has too many reminiscences  We in England our little group of rhymers were weary of all this We wanted to get rid not only of rhetoric but of poetic diction We tried to strip away everything that was artificial to get a style like speech as simple as the simplest prose like a cry of the heart   Real enjoyment of a beautiful thing is not achieved when a poet tries to teach It is not the business of a poet to instruct his age He should be too humble to instruct his age His business is merely to express himself whatever that self may be I would have all American poets keep in mind the example of Francois Villon  So you who are readers should encourage American poets to strive to become very simple very humble Your poet must put the fervor of his life into his work giving you his emotions before the world the evil with the good not thinking whether he is a good man or a bad man or whether he is teaching you A poet does not know whether he is a good man If he is a good man he probably thinks he is a bad man  Poetry that is naturally simple that might exist as the simplest prose should have instantaneousness of effect provided it finds the right audience You may have to wait years for that audience but when it is found that instantaneousness of effect is produced  To illustrate his points Mr Yeats read a few poems Of  An Epitaph by Mr Walter De La Mare he said There is  not an original sentence in this short poem yet it will live  for centuries He spoke of Mr T Sturge Moore as one   Comments and Reviews  of the most exquisite poets writing in England his poetry is a glorification of instinct Our Lady by Miss Mary E Coleridge he read as an example of poetry as simple as  daily speech Continuing he said  We rebelled against rhetoric and now there is a group of younger poets who dare to call us rhetorical When 1 returned to London from Ireland I had a young man go over all my work with me to eliminate the abstract This was an American poet Ezra Pound Much of his work is experimental his work will come slowly he will make many an experiment before he comes into his own I should like to read to you two poems of permanent value The Ballad of the Goodly Fere and The Return This last is I think the most beautiful poem that has been written in the free form one of the few in which I find real organic rhythm A great many poets use vers libre because they think it is easier to write than rhymed verse but it is much more difficult  The whole movement of poetry is toward pictures sensuous  images away from rhetoric from the abstract toward humility  But I fear I am now becoming rhetorical I have been driven  into Irish public life how can I avoid rhetoric  Mr Yeats then read a few poems from a group which will  be printed next month in POETRY Mr Nicholas Vachel  Lindsay followed with his powerful poem The Congo an  interpretation of the African race which will soon appear  in the Metropolitan Magazine also by request General  Booth Enters into Heaven  A few brief remarks preceded the talk of Mr Yeats The editor of POETRY in welcoming the distinguished guest said We honor a great art by honoring its greatest living artist and expressed the hope that the magazine might help prepare an audience for the poet who will come If we may do for him what Mr Yeats did for Synge our efforts will not be without reward   Mr Charles L Hutchinson one of the magazine s guarantors and Mr Charles H Hamill of the Administrative Committee urged the value of the movement for more appreciative recognition of the art Mr Richard Henry Little philosophized about symbolism A poem of salutation and regret was read from Miss Edith Wyatt whom an engagement of long standing had called to Bryn Mawr Mr Roy McWilliams was toastmaster  To Mr Arthur Davison Ficke was accorded the honor of introducing Mr Yeats with the following poem  In days when we were twenty From over seas there came Horns of a silver music Words of a singing flame As on a wind far blowing From hills of faery name  Strange cadencing soft grave It took our hearts in keep We heard the Red Hound coursing Through the pale mists of the deep We saw Edain and Dectora Beautiful deathless asleep  Now days have flickered by us Not silencing that strain The red wrath of Cuchulain Shouts through the hills again And every April wakes in the world Deirdre s immortal pain  Tonight these breathe and eddy Dimly around the board Robbing our lips of greeting Worthy the heart that poured That song of the white arms of desire And terror and the sword   Comments and Reviews  What greeting can we offer him Whom the gods have loved so long Whom the Old World gods have chosen Their singer to the throng The New World can but bring him now The love of men for his song  The song outlasts the singer Whose breath in the song shall live The lighted dreams of man remain Though man is fugitive One thing the gods withheld from the world Beauty for man to give  REVIEWS  Twelve Japanese Painters by Arthur Davison Ficke Ralph Fletcher Seymour Co Chicago This book belongs in any studio that affects the Japanese  print It is forty seven pages of Baedeker for the man who would travel toward Fuji San It is inspired verse It is good criticism It is sound aesthetics I do not see how any one who cares for prints can read it indifferently  Mr Ficke s particular faculty is flawlessness from the mosaic standpoint one inevitable little word after another His hold on me depends upon the fact that in his best pieces this self command never fails One might say that by mere polish he moves the heart His longer more diffuse works have never moved me His type of concentration seems so far impossible for him to achieve in art units that require more than three pages of print to each unit  After going through this particular book of seventeen poems with every person in Springfield with whom I dare   to read verse I found the following pieces kept their first lustre every evening and the last seemed even to increase in luminosity Koriusai Speaks Festival Scene by Kiyonaga The Two Women by Kitao Masanobu and the Portrait of a Woman by Yeishi  And this is not to reflect on the rest The book burns on each page with the gem like flame at least it does to me The first consideration is the self controlled art of Japan the second consideration is life yet the work is so crystalline that Life lives a second life within the book When I plan the future of some hypothetical poet west of the Mississippi I insist that he be corn fed and ramping and write for the farmer and go shouting along Or else severe astringent plain like St Gaudens Lincoln or Sherman long boned and oak hearted  But I must set aside theory here if I am to speak my mind This work of Mr Ficke s brings again dead days when I was one of a group of fanatical art students holding consultations over the embossed brocaded prints of Japan in the Lenox Library New York when the kingdoms of the world were a set of picture books and Hokusai was the king the emperor N V L  The Lonely Dancer and Other Poems by Richard Le Galli  enne John Lane Co  Again in this new book Mr Le Gallienne shows himself the true lyric singer His book shimmers with moonlight and with the fresh scented nights of spring for Mr Le   Comments and Reviews  Gallienne is the poet laureate of April One of his old  poems not in this book begins  Oh climb with me this April night  The silver ladder of the moon  and so soon as spring comes round again these lines come singing into my head That little lyric two stanzas long ha been my constant companion for years  Mr Le Gallienne has lost nothing of his magical interpretation of nature in her more charming moods in this last volume Such poems as To a Bird at Dawn May Is Building Her House and Shadow are very beautiful On page 66 there is a poem without a title of which this is the first stanza  I crossed the orchard walking home The rising moon was at my back The apples and the moonlight fell Together on the railroad track  How still and spangled that is and how full of the soft wind  of an early autumn evening  Again in his love poems such as The Afternoon is Lonely for Your Face is a charming fancy weaving pretty thoughts out of an attractive landscape  Perhaps that same weaving of pretty thoughts is at once  both Mr Le Gallienne s forte and his danger Or perhaps  in this age of the world we have not so great an appetite for  conceits Certainly an occasional dissonance would be a  welcome change for the sweetness and prettiness has a ten  dency to become cloying and when Mr Le Gallienne deals   with so great and elemental a subject as Death the fancies  with which he entwines it seem impertinent and shallow  Her eyes are bluebells now her voice a bird And the long sighing grass her elegy She who a woman was is now a star In the high heaven shining down on me  It is too much literature too little feeling Even when as in An Easter Hymn Mr Le Gallienne tries to be serious and simple the gift of charm betrays him and he weakens his theme by the following characteristic lines  When mid the sobbing of the rain The heart of April beats again  But if a man does one thing well we should not quarrel with him because he does others less well Mr Le Gallienne has a lyric talent of great beauty and we are thankful for what he has to give us  Merchants From Cathay by William Rose Benêt The  Century Co  It is a pleasure to come across a book so full of new and fresh ideas Mr Benêt has a most vigorous and delightful imagination and his sense of rhyme is quite extraordinary forced a little at times perhaps but when the result is so pleasing what does it matter The Bird Fancier is by far the most interesting poem in the book and a very unusual poem it is full of color and sound and with the weird note becoming more and more insistent until it grows to horror   Comments and Reviews  How excellent is the line  On the Fancier s arm the feathers assembled taken in its context and with the rhyme The last stanza is so fine it ought to be quoted but it would lose too much divorced from the rest of the poem  Lack of space forbids more than mention of The Marvellous Munchausen Merchants of Cathay The Iconoclast and Remarks to the Back of a Pew  In his more serious poems Mr Benêt is not so happy They are too derivative and too obviously didactic but Mr Benêt has so much artistic sense that he will doubtless correct this fault with time A L  NOTES  Of the poets represented in this number five have already appeared in POETRY These are Miss Amy Lowell of Brookline Mass author of A
