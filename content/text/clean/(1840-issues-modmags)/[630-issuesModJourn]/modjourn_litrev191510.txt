come to mefor I feel thee resting like a soft sorrow on my heartThou who art alive with the shadowed wounds of ages hast heard me crying out to embrace theemy soul beseeching thee to fold me against thy black bosomAnd in answer thou hast let the mysticism of thy wonder gloom sink into me until my soul hath opened to receive its kissTonight no one but I shall sing to theeFor thou art my mistressThy blackness and mine have weddedAnd now thy dark kiss stingeth like a pain in meInto thy long arms I give myselfNightNightthou art so filled with longingI hear the soft lament of thy deep heart murmuring to meThy dim fingers trail across my face in a blind caressI feel thy yielding body that is spirit more than my spirit behind the somber veils thou wearestI possess thee and our sorrows swell into an ecstacyNightthou art the beautiful shadow thrown upon the earth by my sorrowI have carried thee a buried miracle in my soul of souls until this hourwhen thou hast taken wings and flown out of me to confront meCopyright1915by Margaret CAnderson The Little Review Nightmy Nightlet me enter now into thy darkness until all life beats in vain outside the obscurity of my soulI would vanish from myselfNightmy somber mistressupon thy face my tears shine as stars and make thee more beautifulNightthou art infinity revealedI will stir thy ancient fires on thy cold lips until thou willst thunder to me with thy hidden voices out of thy vast silenceNightI open my heart to hear but I hear only my heart crying outSpeakBeautiful oneI sing to thee for bringing me the madness of silenceI sing to theefor thou art mine for thou art fierce and pregnant with still woundsNightBehold I know theeI have seen the black flames of thy spirit that burn in the depths of theeI have heard

strickenThou art treading silently awaywithout meNight thou hast taken from me the pain of thy kissesThere hath come into thy deep eyes a wearinessThou art dyingThou art dying from my armsThe red glow of death burneth in thy face and is transforming theeNightwhere shall I find thee againWhere shall I seek theeThe dreadful day that is thy white shadow hath comeAnd a part of me hath diedSleep Song I lay in a field of black flowersand there were purple veins and green that floated like thin worms about meThere were soft thick shapes swaying liquidlymoving unseenand I lay under them gripped by soft thick mistsDeep under them I lay hidden and they pulled me deeper into the field rolling softly around meA sorrow that had pursued me in my soul left me as I vanishedleft me and floated above the flowersAnd I saw a white face drifting away like a pale bubble over the top of my black gardenA white face like a dim sorrowlike a mute paindrifting far awaythe white face of a dead love searching in vain for mein vainThe day was a white monsternaked and bellowinggrinning after me with its buildings that were jagged rows of dirty teethThere was no place to hide from my sorrowIt lay in the sky that winked at me like a vast and blue and relentless eyeAnd it lay in the sun that burned like a golden grotesqueIt lay in every laugh and in every beauty and in every little bird that lost itself over the waterI felt the black flowers grow blacker and higher and I moved deeper into the blacknessAnd then a sorrow that had pursued me in my soul left me as I vanishedIt floated away over the tops of the black flowers and I saw her white face moving from me like a pale bubbleI saw the white face of a dead love moving beyond the soft shapes that swayed unseen drifting away like a mute pain and searching in vain for mein vainI ranbut there was no place to run for the monster day ran afterglaring like a white tormentshouting and scampering afterand there was no place to hideNow the day was a white grave opened to meNow it was a wide wave breaking over meAnd now it was a great birdwhite breasted and grey pinionedflying after me and afterbearing my sorrow in its blue beakracing after me until its heart burst in the west and it sankbleeding gorgeously across the skyAnd still I ran but now the night camerunning afterand there was no place to hide from my sorrowI fled in the streets before the darknessBut the stars found me and the trees loomed after me and the houselights followed me and the darkness wept around me and they were my sorrowBut there on the distant vergewhere the night sinks exhausted into the blood red arms of the white monster leaping over the world againI fell deep I fellFar into a hidden land where I lay hidden hidden in a field of black flowers that were threaded with purple veins and green floating like thin worms about meThe Little Review Autumn Song My heart scatters tears over the dark dayThe dull silvered poplar leaves float in the air like dead butterfliesIt is the autumn come againspeaking with its soft tongued winds to the trees and to meIt is coldI have lost my warmthI have lost theeAnd the autumn has come again to tell me of itListen to the sad tongued windsSee the storm faltering in the streetIt is coldIt is the autumn come againthe autumn in whose wild sad treasures we once laughed once when your hot hands reached out to me like a bright cry mocking the somber lisping of the twilight seasonWhere are the songs I sangthe songs that leaped out of flameDo they echo still in your listening earsDo they fall like warm tears in your heartSee the winds droop wearily into the trembling tree armsSee the street grows paleA dying panoply drifts across the grey girthed skyHoLifeI have still a song for youThough you come whispering to me from the golden toombs of youthfrom the scarlet graves of loveI will make of the lament you bring me musicI will make of the dull tears you bring me lyricsI will clothe the grey ghosts of sorrow in rich trappingsFor it is only she who hath diedIt is only she whom I loved with all my soulThough my heart scatter tears over the dark day they are the tears of plentyFor her death hath enriched meFor the autumn is come again speaking with its soft tongued winds to the trees and to me things I have never heard before things that her white breasts never told me things that her burning lips never said to me wildsad things that the flame from whence my songs once leaped never held for meThe dull silvered poplar leaves float in the air like dead butterfliesand they are beautifulDeath Song Last night you came and sat by my bed in a little dark room and boasted to me like a child I have come to destroy the sun you said I will take the greatyellow sun in my fingers and blow on it once and it will go out like a match And I wonderedbecause the sun is so large and hothow such a little one as you could blow it out like a matchBut you said I will blow once into the night and the stars will sputter like little flames in a great wind and scatter away in ashesAnd the moon will spin around and around like a bright coin until it breaks into little black bits And I wondered because the night was so far how such a little breath as yours could reach into its soulBut you saidI will go out and touch the trees and the green leaves will shrivel and the brown trunks will vanishI will breathe just once on the housesthe great big houses of iron and wood and stoneand they will sway like long pieces of black cloth in the wind and they will melt into a dark mist And I wondered and wonderedBut you said In an instant I will walk up and down all the roads you have known I will wander in all the fields you have wandered and pass through all the highways you have beenAnd each place that I move in will cease to beUnder my feet the earth will become a powder and vanish Then you saidfor I had ceased to wonder and was listening sadly I will go to your beloved whose hair is like the silk on the corn and whose eyes are like the deeps of the sea and I will smile on her and she will become as nothingShe will become as a speck of dust and she will never be again And I wondered again how such a little one as you could make my beloved into a speck of dust when she was so beautifulBut you saidI will touch all the faces you have seen with the point of my finger and they will change into little dark clouds and I will blowthem away with the stars and the moon and the yellow sun And I thought of all the faces you boasted to destroy and wonderedbecause there were so manyBut you said Do you remember the little bird you saw hopping on the stones in the park one dayI will go find the little bird and lay my hand on her and she will never hop on the stones again I remembered the little birdAnd you said Do you remember the widegreen water that rolled itself into a great colored ball and bounced up and down under the sunListen I will go and blow on the water and it will disappear into a single dropAnd I will bring this drop back to you to wear in your eyes when they close And I wondered and wonderedBut you saidListen there is an old woman who smiles when she thinks of youI will walk up behind her and touch her gently on the shoulder and she will vanish And I murmured Do not touch the old woman But you saidListen I will lay my hand over all the wild notes and sweet notes you have heard and they will be hushedI will kill the songs that lie unborn in the earth and the sea and the cherry trees and in the white throats of birds and women and in the hearts of men And I wondered how such a little one as you could hush so great a chorusBut you came closer to me and said I have come to destroy the world for youto pluck out every little blade of grass and every flowerto brush away the stars and kick over the hills and tear up all the fields It was dark in the little room where we were and I sighedAnd you came closer to me and said I will gather up in a greatblack bag everyone and everything and every God you have known and I will drop them into a greatblack holeAnd listen and then you will be aloneIIThe Synagogue This street in the ghetto looks at night a prison corridorthe houses facing it are dark cells And then you come to a block where the ricketythin tenements like gnawedpatient pencils tracing crazy star lines the sky And then you come to the Synagogue of Judas the Servantlittle church of the Jews on its knees enveloped in the rags of cheap saloons and hovels It thrusts its iron star into the night Like a strange voice whispering in a dark placeAnd its stained walls impregnated with an ancient faith Murmur stoically to the stars of burning prayers and hopeless sobs And other things they have never heardAnd if you stand before it for a time Strange wild things will cry out of the shadowsAnd you will see the tornbleeding image of a race Whom Christ crucifiedIn the Sun O what a day The buildings are bursting into bloomHugedazzling flowers sweeping against the heavenDizzy ferns waving like dreadful fans under the flying cloudsThe shining windows flutter down like a shower of golden petalsO what a day The buildings are crashing into bloom Gleaming stalks of purple sprawling with a graceful frenzy into spaceSmoke monsters dance lazily over their headsThe sky swims like a blue butterfly in and out among themThe streets race awayA golden wind sweeps with a roar through the world that has become a fierce gorgeous gardenand it nods breathlesslyOut of its blazing depths color leaps and the growling music of a torn God singing in painO what a daybursting into madness The Little Review On the Beach The lake comes gliding in and inAnd gliding out it goesRunning up and back on the ribbon of the beach That plays with its silver toesAnd the lake reaches down to the hem of its gown With its cool curved wind of a handAnd throws out its petticoat lacy and white With a swish swish over the sandIts blue dress flutteringtinted with the sunHangs from its girdle white spacedAnd a far ship riding with its nose in hiding Stands black like a buckle at its waistIt begins to rain and the lake birds fly With a whir and an angry screechAs the thin grey fingers reach down from the sky And taptap faintly on the beachDigging little holes for an elfin folkPointing up the water like a grateAnd the sky moves closer like a gust of smoke And behind it crouch and wait Great half shapes and grey cloud apesAnd a greyold water crewAnd the lake birds fly with their wings awrySearching in their faces for the blueNow the long rain chants in the grasses on the hyllAnd the lake runs in with a frightened soundAnd sullen and wet the sand sinks lowLike a heavy brown cloud on the groundOn the hill top green the trees bend away And brood as they lower and bendAnd grey things walk beyond the grey Where the sands and the waters endThe rain has stopped and the earth like a bride Has hung white petals in her hairAnd the sky draws back till the white clouds ride Like soft white gardens in the airAnd a butterfly flutters like an endless note Over the lake s thin brinkAnd the sand takes off its heavy brown coat And the cloud apes vanish and sinkThe gay water dawns and the grasshopper pipes And the lake glides in anewDressed in greens and in awning stripesAnd little birds leap toward the blue The Little Review The Dionysian Dreiser DREISER is the greatest novelist in AmericaIt is not a distinctionHe has written poor novelsHis latest novelTheGeniuspublished by John Lane Company is loose in partsIt limpsIt loses its breathIt grows thinBut it is a novel of sweep and magnitudeof sledge hammer blows and fine chiselingIn the caramel chorus of America s chirping fictionists Dreiser raises the smoothvirile voice of an artistAnd there is no voice like his in AmericaI prefer to write of what Dreiser has done in TheGeniusthan to tell in detail of what it is aboutCalmlyaloofly with a consummate dispassion Dreiser has thrust his magic pen home into the heart of American PuritanismGod forgive himGod forgive the publishersGod forgive everybody who reads the book and forgive me who write about itFor American Puritanism is a sacred thingas sacred as the gilt on the cathedral altar placesas hallowed as the bathroom in a bawdy houseAnd Dreiser has peeled off the gilt and ruthlessly thrust open the doorMay he be cursed with the wrath of an avenging public conscienceMay he be made to wither under the distinction of being a maniacle sensualista libidinous ruffiana lascivious distiller of corrupting langoursAmenAgainst the gray dirt backgroundthe shallow hued smears of his many contemporariesDreiser s book stands forth like a red cry of truthIt is not the book of a man enraged with the narrowness of a countrysputtering against the insipidity of its composite idealsDreiser never descends to the punitive hectoring of a Robert HerrickNor does he join the plaintive assaults upon the pusillanimous conventions which characterize theadvancedfiction of the countryHe does not make his men and women vehicles for the antiquated day dream of brotherhood boshHe does not prostitute his work in dramatizing the current quibblesmarketing asinine public convulsions in the literary capsules so commonly compounded by our quackcreators All these things he does not do and if the reading public of today will not reward himthe God of DostoevskyFlaubertHuysmannsShakespeare and Ambrose Bierce willWhat Dreiser does do is tell a straightforward storytell it with all the painstaking genius of the old Flemish paintersAnd he uses for his background not the isolated strata of any single callingbut a country your world and mine and our neighbor sLife is greater than any of its truthssings Theodore DreiserThere are many kinds of goodmany kinds of standards and many kinds of virtueThere is the virtue of farmer Bluethe solidmasculineclear and open virtue rooted in the laws of the land and the rigamarole of societythriving on the longbrown roadsthe ploughed fields and the homely beauties of existenceAnd there is the virtue of Eugene Witlathe aestheticvibrating pursuit of beauty rooted in the soul of the artistthriving on the illusive lust of womenthe intangible urge of inspiration spitting in the face of laws unnatural to it and the fallacies that would be its fettersYessays Dreiser I do not quote him life is a wide field bearing on its bosom beautiful flowers that do not resemble each other and that require widely different care and nourishmentTo think that such commonplaces should be distinctive notes in the art of a country But they areIf you have read these things into novels before you have not read them into American novelsI do not recall a single hero in American fictionwho is not a Puritanwho does not suffer when he sinswhom the indulgence of his desire for women does not inspire to repentance andreformand success as the blue literary laws of America demandFor further particulars on this general subject see MrMencken s fulmination in last month s Smart SetOn this broad canvas of thought it is that Dreiser worksIn his new novel he begins in a little town in IllinoisOut of the midst of a mediocre family living in the concentric provincialism of the middle west he launches his young hero Witla a lad suffering from dreams and stomach trouble and a vague distinguishing unrestHis types are masterpiecesHis styleshorn of pretentious reticence or rhetorical pompis the painstaking and poetical diction he revealed in Jennie GerhardtBut he is not infallibleThere are sentencesparagraphs which jarAlthough his strokes in delineating character and situation are swift and certainhis language often seems lamehis words wateryhis phrases triteBut these are as the flaws of a panoramic pen crowded at moments to a point of impatience and not the faults of a weak writerThe effect is untouchedHis people breathe out of the pagesThey are personalitiesFrom beginning to end Dreiser reveals a psychology of character amazing in its range and detachmentWitla as a boy lives in AlexandriaIllinoisDreiser traces the development of his soul and sex and struggle out of the blanketing bourgois of his birthplaceThe youngGene answers the call of beautywithout knowing what it is that calls himHe comes to ChicagoHe is a laundry wagon drivera

is aboutIt is partially a depiction of the struggle between an artist husband and agood womanwho is his wifepartly the struggle between the flesh and the spirit of the same husband and the tale of

who doesn t listen to youwho describes you at your various bestswho wrings the pathos and joys out of your little worlds who paints in with the brush of a universal art what you and I are doing in Alexandria and Chicago and New York and all the milk station stops betweenI am not a disciple of the Dreiserian GospelI would like to argue with him the certain superiorities of monogamy for the artistBut he has limned a hero who is not a sugar coated moralizerHe has ignored superbly the mob begotten mandates of literary excellenceWhatever his faults of composition or constructionand there are not so many as his friends endeavor to make out there arehe has magnificently booted the reading publicthe morally subsidized critics and the very publishers in the coarsest regions of their bodies their soulsAnd for these things I hail him as the greatest novelist in the countryI acclaim him as the only realuncontaminated genius of these States and pray to God that my friend Sherwood Anderson will hurry up and get published so that there will be two of themTHE SCAVENGER Leather Lane Three restless gas jets In Leather LaneA thousand facesWandering in the nightToo dull for painGod

truthmy friend There is no truthIt is impossible for the human mind to attain the truthYou can tell the truth with reservationswith omissionsPerhaps you can speak the truth that is only part truthYesthat is often done by virtuous people and by clever peopleBut to speak the truththe whole truth and nothing but the truthto place your soul naked before either God or manthatmy friendis impossibleI have listened to women lieSometimes it is only necessary to watchAnd it is the same with a manWhatA man will tell the truth before GodYou are quite wrongA man will lie to himself and he will lie to his GodI knowI listened to a man lie to GodI will tell you the storyThe man s name was Henry SpencerYou perhaps remember itHe was a murdererOne of his victims was a tango teacher named MrsAllison RexroatWhen the body of MrsRexroat was found behind a clump of bushes in a lonely spot the police somehow blundered upon a clewIn four days they traced the murder of the woman to Henry SpencerThey wove a net of evidence about himOh they are cleversometimesmy friendOn the fifth day Henry Spencer sat in the police captain s office and they sweated himAfter five hours he confessedOrdinarily this means nothingI have seen criminals confess to crimes of which they were innocentSweating is an unintelligent processbut then criminals are unintelligent persons and for a stupid mind the whole affair becomes quite an ordealThe police captain says You did The criminal replies I didn t It is very simplemy friendbut very wearingparticularly when there are five policemen to sayYou did and none but yourself to sayI didn t But it happened this time that the policemen blundered upon a real confessionAfter five hours Henry Spencer jumped to his feet and shouted YesI didI killed her He was led awayTwo days later he repeated his confession and elaborated on itHe sketched the murderdescribed the events leading up to itThe policemenhighly elatedrushed out and verified all he had saidThey found the hammer he told them he had used where he said he had thrown itThey found the effects of the murdered woman where he said he had hidden themHenry Spencer went to trialA number of attorneys defending him pleaded insanitySpencer upset their efforts by rising in the court room and informing the jury he was quite sane and that he had committed a number of murders in his lifeGiven permission by the court he informed them that his life had been an extremely illegal oneHe named five women he had killedThe policehighly elatedrushed out and verified his statementsIn concludingthe defendant again sought to impress them with the fact that he was quite sane and willing to pay the penalty for his crimesIn fact several times he cried out from his seat Hurry up and hang me You will arguemy friendthat there was an instance where in the very depravity of his nature a man attained the naked truthYou are quite wrongHenry Spencer killed the women he said he killedbut he failed of the truthFor three months he had sat in his cell figuring the thing outHe came to the conclusion that by telling truthfully of his crimes and pleading truthfully of his sanity he would create the impression that he was indeed a maniacYou seeit is quite simpleLies are always simpleIt is only the truth which is impossible to understandHenry Spencer s logic proved accurateHe convinced the jury that he was a maniacBut he had placed too much faith on the technical interpretation of the lawThe jury sentenced him to hanganywaySo did the judgeThe date was set and Henry Spencer waited in the jail of a little town in IllinoisIt is the duty of a large number of people in the world to save souls from HellDo not think I speak sarcasticallymy friendThere is nothing wrong in thisexceptof courseits utter futilityFor two months the RevMrWilliamshis wifeand his son visited Henry Spencer daily in his cellThey taught him religionThe doomed man was an illiterateHe had been brought up in the streetsHe spoke English vulgarly and he understood nothingHis mind was unformed and his ideas of any particular life to be were as vague as his ideas of the life that wasSo he became religiousThis is quite a story in itselfhis acquiringfaith They played hymns in his cell on an old melodeonEach night the Williams family knelt with him and prayedHe found in the Scriptures and their promise something that stilled the cold terror of deathHis nerves became quietIn fact he became buoyantYou will say it is impossible for a man to acquire genuine faith under such circumstancesYou are quite wrongmy friendI will prove it to you soonOn the day preceding his execution Henry Spencer exhibited the only bit of nervousness during his watch for deathHe objected to the big clock that hung in the corridor outside his cellHe didn t like the way it tickedYou know whySo they removed the clockHow kind people are to those whom they are about to destroyThey quite resemble the Gods in the matterI am coming now to the point of the storyso be patientmy friendIt was a sunny morning in early JulyInside a stockade they had erected a scaffoldDuring the night Henry Spencer sang hymnsThe sheriff sat on the doorstep of his home adjoining the jail listening and looking at the moon and greasing a hempen rope with cold cream which he borrowed from his daughterHe was a religious man and the hymns made him sadThe Little Review At ten o clock the death march started from Spencer s cellNow there were thirty eight steps leading to the top of the scaffold which rose high above the stockade topI know this because a young man named Smith and I walked up the steps the midnight before and counted themAfter counting them I made a wager with the young man that Spencer would never reach the top unsupportedSo I was exceedingly interested when the death march entered the stockadeA number of persons were privileged to march in the lineand the first to appear was SpencerHe was dressed as if he were hurrying to a tennis game white trouserswhite shoesa soft white collarand a white shirtOn the pocket of his shirt he had pinned a red carnationHe walked with a lightspringy stepBehind him trailed the RevMrWilliams and the othersHenry Spencer wore a good natured smile on his faceWhen he reached the bottom step of the scaffold I held my breathI watched him skip nimbly up the stairsnever missing a stepnever tripping or hesitatingUnder more virtuous circumstances the thing would have passed for heroismAt any rate I lost the wagerSpencer stood on the scaffoldthe noose hanging over his shoulderThe smile had not left his faceSeveral hundred necks were craned towards himI would have felt chilled to see so many necks at such a time had I been heThe sheriff and his assistant began dressing him in a white robe that covered him from the neck downHe commenced talking at once My friends he saidextending his armThey strapped it to his side as he did so but he continued unflustered I am glad of the opportunity this gives me of telling you that for the first time in my life I am happyI have found a mother and a God and a friend while I have been in jail waiting for deathAlthough it is going to cost me my life I am glad I am here to tell you thisI have repented for my sinsI have made my peace with my God and my fellow menAnd I am happymy friendshappyI have found a mother who has shown me the way to peace and salvationI am grateful to Him for the gladness he has put in my heartOhmy friends He raised his head to the skyStanding against the sun in his white robehis face transfigured with a wonderful smilehe looked like some Crusader giving himself into the arms of the VirginAbove him stretched the green leafy branch of a tree that rustled faintly in the breezeA little bird sat on a twig and chirpedAnd still above stretched the pure blue sky with its white fleece cloudsHenry Spencer looked at it all lifethe little birdthe skythe green leaves and smiledsmiled as I have never seen a man smile beforeThey strapped his ankles and then the sheriff adjusted the rope around his neck with great careHis political future was dependent on his taskSpencer resumed talkingHe recited two long psalms with never a wrong wordand I who had listened to him five months ago sat astoundedHis voicehis accenteverything about him had changedA theologian could have rendered the psalms no more accuratelyThen he looked at the sky againI felt that before his eyes the clouds rolled away and God revealed himselfa gigantic figure seated on a golden throneI felt that he saw the cherubs and the angels he had read of in the scripturesperceived the jewelled streets and the harpists and Christ waiting with outstretched arms and forgiveness Yesmy friends he went on I am not afraidfor I have given myself to Christpure in spiritstrong in faith He quoted from the Bible SeeI smile at it allfor believe meO LordI am happy The sheriff had lifted the white hood to the man s head and was beginning to adjust itThe smile never left his facethe light that blazed from his eyes never dimmed I am going to heaven he said as they settled the hood on his head and I want to say only one more thing before I goMy friendsas I stand hereI tell you I am innocent of the murder of MrsAllison Rexroat And they hanged himThe truthThe human ego is too weak for truthWhat do you saymy friendWe carry faithfully what we are givenon hard shouldersover rough mountainsAnd when perspiringwe are toldYealife is hard to bear But man himself only is hard to bearThe reason is that he carrieth too many strange things on his shouldersLike the camel he kneeleth down and alloweth the heavy load to be put on his backNietzsche Romain Rolland ELLEN KEYAuthorised translation from the Swedish by Mamiah Bouton BorthwickCopyright1914 IIN Clamecya quiet town in Nivernais in Central FranceRomain Rolland was born in 1866His family had dwelt for centuries in the little placeboth as country folk and townspeopleQuite contrary to the inference one would draw from Jean Christopheneither German nor other foreign ancestry is discoverable in the family lineageRolland is descended from pure French Catholic burgher stockHis parents devoted themselves with loving zeal to his education his mother endowing him with a musical sense and love of music that made musicfrom earliest childhoodhis passion and joyhis fathera notary in Clamecygave up his profession that he might accompany his young son to ParisIt is not the external events of his lifebut the spiritual atmosphere and environment of his native townthat Rolland depicted in the sixth part of Jean Christopheunder the sub title Antoinette The landscape of Nivernais is a mingling of rivers and canalsgreat forests and Mont de Moran s peaksThe region unites memorials of the Keltic and Gallic Roman times and cathedrals of the Gothic periodstimulating the historical sense whichnext to the sense of musicis most characteristic of Romain RollandHe entered the Ecole Normale supérieure in Pariswhen about fifteen or sixteen years of ageand later went to the Academia di Francia in RomeHe considers the friendship formed there with Malvida von Meysenburgprofoundly significant in his developmentAs she was a faithful friend of Mazzini and Herzenof Wagner and Nietzschein middle ageso in her old age she was the friend of Romain Rolland Her memory is sacred to me he recently wroteand he had continued in regular correspondence with her from 1890 until her death in 1903Rome exercised a profound influence upon his entire spiritual lifeHe spent there the years 1889 and 1890and has since made frequent visits for longer or shorter periodsItaly is the country whichnext to Francehe knows best and loves mostGermanyon the other handwhich he hasSee my article in Verk och Människorin which I endeavored to show my countrymen the value to them of Memoiren einer IdealistenHistoire de l Opéra en Europeavant Lully et Scarlatti Les origines du theatre lyrique modem and also Les causes de la decadence de la peinture italiennedescribed in Jean Christophe so vividly that one is convinced he must have passed a great part of his life therehe knows only through some minor journeysIn 1895he received his doctor s degree at the University of Parisand presented two thesesHe wasfirstinstructor in the History of Art at the school he had attended later he became professor of History of Music at the Sorbonnea position he will probably resign partlybecause an automobile accident injured his arm so that he can no longer illustrate his lectures on the History of Music with the piano partlybecause he has found the combination of authorship and lectures too great a strain upon his delicate healthConcerning the literary impressions that were decisive in his developmenthe says that his educationlike that of most young Frenchmenwas founded upon the classics of the seventeenth centuryHe found his wayhimselfto the writers who gave him spiritual sustenanceShakespeareGoetheand the Encyclopedistsespecially DiderotIn 1886along with his school comradeshe became acquainted with TolstoyIn his book on TolstoyRolland says He was the purest light that illumined our youththe cheering star in the twilight of the end of the century our only real friend in contemporary European art It was Tolstoy s intoxicating adoration of life that enraptured the young Frenchmen as well as the young NorthernersIt was the realism in Tolstoy s art thatopened the portals to lifeit was the mysticism in Tolstoy s nature that opened their ears tothe music of the soul for which they longed Tolstoy was to our generation what Werther was to the youth of the eighteenth centuryBut wrote Rolland in a letter the most potent influence in my life was and continues to be musicIt has been an ever flowing springnot only for my emotional lifebut also for the interpretation of lifeForto him who can rightly listenmusic is a language that can interpret the subtlest emotions of the souland reveal manifold secrets which literature has never been able to expressIf in any degree I understand the German soulit is due to music Romain Rolland is familiaralikewith the old German masters of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuriesand with those of most recent timesJean Christophethe world s greatest novel concerning a musician and musicis therefore written by a thoroughly trained connoisseur and practitioner of music a man who demonstrates thatfor his own and for his hero s individual culturemusic is the most profound determining influenceEven though Romain Rolland differs from Tolstoy in questions pertaining to his conception of musicstill it is in Tolstoy s spirit that he glorifies in this form of art its universal breadthits power beyond national boundaries and personal limitations to unite mankind in and through the joy of beautywhich is one of the highest conditions of the soulOne aspect of Romain Rolland s literary work is a direct expression of his profound belief in the ethical mission of artHe participated ardently in the movementinstituted at the close of the last centurythat purposed to educate the workingman by means of elevated amusementsespecially playsBut Rolland did notlike Tolstoyseek to awaken love of mankind he wanted to strengthen power of action and heroismRolland has recently published the second edition of a book in which he has collected his controversial articleswritten at the time when he and a group of friends hoped to create a new theatre for the awakening peopleand thus contribute to the encouragement of that energy of action necessary to the solution of the great problems the time presentsPleasureenlightenmentenergysays Rollandare what the theatre should furnish the peopleNeither the classic dramawhich bores the workingman to death by presenting to him les parties mortes de l amenor the present dramawhich injures or lowers him by setting him in a fever of sordid passionsis fit for a people s theatreIt must furnish the best drama of the present timethe spectacle in which the serious aspect of the time is reflectedor scenes from those earlier phases in which the spirit of struggle and of devotion livedin other wordsit must furnish a virile and wholesome artThe heroes of the French Revolution were Rolland s inspiration for the dramaand he utilized the struggles of the time of the Revolution for spectacles and folk festivalsAt that time he wrote and produced for the people s theatreLe 14 JuilletDantonLes LoupsLe triomphe de la raisonThe last he has recently publishedtogether with two other early dramasStLouis and AertThey are allas he himself saysdevoted to religious enthusiasm for Godfor countryfor reasonHe wished to set these pictures of struggling devotion against the cowardice of thought and cowardice of will that he saw everywhere around himHe voiced his own sentiment and that of his young kindred spirits in the words of one of his heroeswho was condemned to deathLife will be what I willI have anticipated victorybut I shall be victorious And in the words of anotherYou are always thinking of what you can keep or loseOnly think of what you can giveLive be like the water that flows The world would not exist without that happiness of beingsof flowers in the sunthat joy of giving one s life to the point of exhaustion which is also a joy of dying continually It is elder brother to Jean Christophe Rolland says less robust but not less faithful who uttered these wordswhich comprise Rolland s creed in its most succint formulaTo revive the energy of action of the French Revolution in order to continue thus the work interrupted in 1794to set in motion the great passionsnot for the purpose of arousing chauvinistic or revolutionary fanaticismbut in order to kindle anew the universal feeling of solidaritythis was the hope of Rolland and his friends for the future of France This hope he says was one of the purest and holiest forces in our young lives Rollandthereforecalls his Theatre du peuple a document of the timebecause itreflects the artistic ideas and hopes of a whole generation He gives voice now1913to that proud utterance Let the future judge us even should it prove that it was our crime to have believed too much in the future That this little group has not yet been victoriouswe knowRomain Rolland indicated the reason when he saidIn order to fashion a theatre for the peoplewe must first have a peoplea people with a freedom of the soul able to enjoy arta people with leisurea people not oppressed by misery or incessant toil a people not brutalized by every superstition and fanaticism from right and lefta people lord over itself and victor in the battle fought out from day to day To these utterances of 1903 can be added one of this yearin which Rolland expressed himself most fervently and with comprehension in regard to the working class of women and in that connection in regard to the whole woman question It was made evidentthenthat the idealist Rolland is no advocate of the chauvanistic religious reactionHis idealism is of the whirl of revolutionary times and the futureHis critique upon the classic French literaturehisTeutonismin Jean Christophehis political and religious radicalismhave made him as obnoxious to nationalistic Catholic France as Mmede Stael once was because of her De l AllemagneAmong other evidences of Rolland s status in his own country is the circumstance that when the French Academy recently awarded its new prize of 10 000 francsit was giventhrough the influence of Maurice Barrésto a wholly new man in French literature André Lafon du Blayeinstructor in a Catholic private schoolwho had written a book about a school boya book which was found to possess thatelevated characterthe awarding of the prize demanded Jean Christophe had just been finished It ishowevernot merely in academic circles that Romain Rolland is denied recognitionHe has succeeded in getting himself well hated in many another circle because of the cutting truths in Jean Christophedirected against all factionsIn Ord och Bild1912George Brandes has given a brief but excellent characterization of Rolland s spiritual and intellectual endowments and of his limitationsWithout doubt Rolland s spiritual tendency in youth was determined not only by Tolstoy but also by Guyau the more because Tolstoy has Guyau to thank for whatever of reason is found in his theories of artIn regard to the influence of Guyau upon Tolstoy and Nietzschesee In a preface to Celles qui travaillenta work of the notable and sincere French authoressSimone Bodèvefor exampleProfessor Albert Nilson s excellent essay upon Guyau s AestheticsIn the mind of Rolland as well as of Guyauthe ethical ideal is the highest intensive quality of lifethe most effective energyRolland is far from the Christian ascetcism that diluted the wine of TolstoyBut along with Tolstoywith Guyauwith Nietzschehe demands an art that possesses life s consummate vigor that is itself the richest lifethe highest intensity of powerIn other words the ethical ideal and the aesthetic are at heart the same thingthe fundamental principle of art and religion is solidaritythe sense of beauty is at the same time the most intensive and the most expansive of feelingsand so like the love of humanity the great fraternizing power They who love most create most richly andthe work that reveals to us the life of greatest value is the noblestthese propositions permeated Rolland just as they did Guyau and Tolstoyalthough Rolland establishes a basis of valuation quite different from that of the latterPerhaps Bergsontoohas in some respects confirmed Rolland s personal view of lifeBut as Rolland s view was enunciated before Bergson began to writethe influence could have been only to strengthennot to determine itNo idea harmonized better with Rolland s own innermost being than that respecting the power of the spirit to make a way for creativeunfathomableinexhaustible lifeJem Christophefrom the first chapter to the lastis an illustration of this explosive powerthis élan vitalSchiller s words come to mind Der Dichter ist der einzige wahre Mensch und der beste Philosoph ist nur eine Karikatur gegen ihn The poet is the only real Man and the best philosopher is only a caricature beside himNot only with his dramas of the Revolution did Romain Rolland endeavor to make his countrymen hero worshippers he also began a series of popular biographies aimed to presentnot the great man s workbut the personal powers and experiences that found expression in his workHe says in the preface Europe is poisoned with materialism and egotismwe must throw open the windows to get airRespirons le souffle des hérosLet us breathe the breath of heroes He rejoices that he too has witnessed contemporary heroic deeds the defense of the Boers and the vindication of DreyfusBut he knows that it iseasier to kindle enthusiasm by heroes of the past heroeswho were great in heart His hero worship did not lead himhoweverto glorification at the expense of truthHe utters the thoughtprofoundly true and all too little understoodthat every lack of harmony between life and its laws dependseven in great spirits not upon their greatnessbut upon their weaknesses But these weaknesses render them not less worthy of our love The idealism that will not recognize the truth is cowardice there is only one heroism in the world to see the world as it is and to love itIn a letter to Goethe1795after reading Wilhelm MeisterSo without hesitationRolland points out weaknesses in Michael Angelo s lifeand inconsistencies in Tolstoy sHe sees in both great specimens of thetype that will pass awaythe Christian those whohave had their refuge in God and the everlasting life when this life has gone against them those whose faith has often been expression for deficient belief in lifein the futurein themselves a lack of courage and a lack of gladnessI know he continues of how many defeats your grievous victories are madeand therefore I pity you and admire youYou make the world more doleful but more beautifulPraised be pain and praised be joyBoth are holythey form the world and they broaden great souls joy and pain are powersare lifeare GodThe three biographies that Rolland has thus far published are of BeethovenMichael Angeloand TolstoyIn the firstit is the love of life and the courage of life in the secondcreative power and strength of belief in the thirdthe ecstacy of life and the love of mankindthat he emphasizesSuch soulshe saysrestore to us belief in life and in mankindfor from themissues a current of social power and potent goodness IIBeethoven is Rolland s own conception of lifeand is nearest his heartTo thatsoul of musicheroismand goodnessRolland has reared the only memorial worthy of Beethoven that art has created Jean ChristopheThis book was published during the course of nine yearsBut long before it began to appear it had lived in and with its writer for the greater part of his lifeIn it Rolland has committed to writing his profound conception of the innermost being of a musical geniusand has done it in such a manner that one is firmly convinced of the truth of the revelations that one follows from the cradle to the graveIn other novels concerning geniuses the writers assert incessantly that they are geniuses here the genius evinces himself through his beingOne does not read a bookone lives a life and a life of the highest valuethe existence that great spirit creates that of the geniuswho out of the flaming chaos of his nature forms a cosmosAneducational novel of which the world s literature thus far possesses only one such in Wilhelm Meisterandin a measurein Keller s Der Grune Heinrich I have lived more intensely with Jean Christophe than with most living people World fame is a curious thingSometimes it is attained quickly through glorifying friends a path to fame that often early avenges itself that is more dangerous even than the fame that the attacks of enemies furnishSometimes fame is won with one blowby an exceptional work againEpitome of the introduction to Michael Angelo Lack of space forces me to omit Miss Key s interesting but very long analysis of Jean ChristopheThe EditorThe Little Review it is prepared for in silence and then suddenly rushes forth with the roar of a great torrent formed by many small streamsThe last is the case with Romain RollandWhen I read him in 1909in SwitzerlandI went shortly afterwards to Pariswhereat that timehe was not mentioned among the celebrated writers and where even his friends thought he dare not reckon his circle of readers larger than the ten or fifteen thousand faithful he possessed in the world of French speaking readersIn Germany his circle was still narrower in Swedenhe was unknown even by nameFor the new generation the book is a document of the spiritual history of the timeFor the serious minded portion of the French youthRolland has possessed an influence comparable with his own description of Tolstoy s influence upon himself and the young generation with himYouth has learned from him that the fleeting fashionable attitude toward the great souls or ideas that Paris shapes is sterile that it is only by devotion that a spiritual growth can be attainedthat skepticism in the face of all greatness is povertybut admiration and loveis the wayto the most potentthe richestlife Youth has found in him contempt for mere fine phrasesfor declamationand received from him Goethe s conception of creation In the beginning was action They have heard him proclaim that nationalism that is loyalty to the best in the essence of the French nation love of truth and justicedesire for freedom and fraternitydevotion to its ideal values and above all the dream of happiness for all mankindThis dream that among us Teutons is content to sleepis among Frenchmen an ever restless disturbance of the bloodAnd it is only by occasionally letting his blood flow for these dreams that he feels he is living up to his highest idealsThis Youth for whom each new part of Jean Christophe has been a great eventdespises with Rolland the estheticism that turns from lifeThis youth has learned to distinguish between great art and the work of those who think they are creating art but are only making artsBut above allat a time of reaction toward the Christianfaitha reaction that has been justified by the fact that science has not been able toexplainlife norvindicateit they receive a new fountain of living waterRolland has attempted neither to explain life nor defend itThe leit motiv of his great symphonic work is Beethoven s thought Durch Leiden Freude Through suffering joy comes We canso he saysneither understand life in all its plenitude of contradictions nor ennoble it in all its brutality in any way other than by living it one s self in the fullest and highest meaning of the wordMusicthe all unifying artlovethe all embracing condition of the soulare the two highest attitudes of devotion to Godwho is lifeMore Rolland knows notAnd more than he knows the veracious man does not say I cannot he writes give any metaphysical credoForin the first placeI will never deceive myself by saying I know that which I do not know whichat the mostI can imagine or hopeIn the second placeI will never confine myself within the limits of any beliefFor I hope to develop until my last dayI wish to reserve for myself unlimited freedom of intellectual transformation and renewalI have many gods in my Pantheon but my chief godhead is LibertyAt present I do not separate the essence of the human soul from that of the divine spiritof which the former is a partBut I hardly believe that this divine spirit fills the universeIt seekscertainlyto fill the world and guide it but nothing indicates that it will succeedEven in this regard I reserve space for libertyPure monism does not satisfy meI am more inclined to a dualism such as the ancient Empedocles believed inI have an unbounded admiration for the pre Socratic philosophersthe sages of Ionia and Magna GraeciaIndeed my first workwritten at Rometwenty years agowas a drama with Empedocles as heroThe struggle between two principles is manifest to me in the whole history of the worldmaterial as well as moral historyThe question is whether there is not a third principlein which the other two are included or harmonizedA trinity therefore it is singular how this form forces itself upon the human mind but a trinity very different from the Christian conception of the trinitysince it comprises a father and two striving brothers a triad that approaches the antique cosmogony of which we find a reflection in Hesiodin ChaosGaeaand ErosIf I live I shall go deeper into ancient thoughtThose ancient philosophers lived in more intimate contact with nature than any of their successorsandmoreovercollected the thousand year old wisdom of the whole Orient Besides this personal utterance of Rolland himselfa French friend of hisintimate with his thoughthas given me permission to communicate the following statement of the trend of Rolland s thoughtThe liberty of his mindhis lucidityhis keen penetrationrender him incapable of accepting the least dogma or the least constraintIt is impossible to conceive of anything that could have upon such a mindnot to say a direct holdbut even an appreciable influenceThat mind is alonemagnificently aloneas independent as if the world were just bornMoreoverhe is quite as far from all revealed religions as from all systemsHe would in no wise admit that the Christian or any other religion is more closely related to the pastand Darwinism or any scientism whatever more to the futureHe would seein these diverse ways of viewing lifeforms of the human mind which return at periodic intervals and of which one no more than the other is an absolute progress in which he does not believeOnly by his very naturehe is antimaterialisticHe believes in the duality of soul and body in an absoluteorganic mannerHe hopes sincerely to quit this body and go to live a larger and fuller lifeNo personal immortalityHe cannot endure the thoughtThat would be the continuation of this captivity in a limited personalitywhich to him appears stiflingHe feels that he is also going to live in Godnot understanding by that word The Little Review any anthropomorphic godbut a fountain of universal lifeHe loves to plungethrough time and spaceinto a meditation in which he totally forgets his personalityand wherein he finds a sort of intoxicationHe has uttered this admirable and terrible sentence Sometimes I feel no difference between my friends absent or presentliving or dead To ask such a being if he is of the past or of the future would have no significancehe is beyond the compass of timeI have met Rolland only through lettersBut some words concerning his personalityas it had affected another poetI can communicate here in conclusionThe confident grasp replete with experiencethe modest ripeness in his beingthe benignitythe unprecedented purity in all his purpose are beneficent Everything is genuinedeveloped with will and consciousness a man who has improved steadily From him emanates a gentle plenitudeconsummate in actionlike that of a star at twilight When world renown comes to such a manit has not much to say to himRolland meets it with an averted glance in his far seeing luminous eyeseyes which quietly and steadily look towards new works and new horizonsFrom all corners of the world he hears that he has given to the time the book most brimming with the whole seething life of the timethat he has given men the book most permeated with the essence of music and Orphean effects that he has created an entire human racea race in which all ages of life and degrees of developmentin which women as well as men are equally convincing in truth to life that he has given a work overflowing with ideaswith philosophy of lifewith vital helpby exhibiting a great human life in all its weakness and in all its strengthAnd assuredly this will give him joyBut he will feel proud only when the word comes that his French heart longs to hear The people that has given to the world such a work is notas its enemies saygoing to destructionThat nation is ever potent with the energy of lifeRolland s great book is not merely a glorious revelation of the fact that all the greatest ideas that France has given the world live ever in the French peopleIt demonstrates also that mankind needs the French spirit always in order to realize themPoemsWITTER BYNNER I Shall Come to

landmarks in Russian modern historyThe Napoleonic war was followed by the insurrection of the Decembriststhe first attempt on the part of liberal Russia to break the autocracyThe iron reign of Nicolas I culminated in the Crimean campaignwhich revealed the utter rottenness of the old order and necessitated the general reconstruction of the estatefrom the liberation of the serfs to the establishment of jury tribunalsThe reaction under Alexander III and Nicolas II came to a collapse with the Japanese warmore disastrous and richer in results than SebastopolIt may be interesting to notice that each of the mentioned epochs followed the previous one at a space of about a quarter of a centuryand the fact that the present war broke out only ten years after the last one may be interpreted as an attempt for self correction on the part of HistoryBoth the war with Japan and the revolution that came as its result were abortive and premature phenomenaand were destinedto be continued It is necessary to get an idea of what has occurred in Russia during the last ten years in order to understand her present situation and perspectivesThe Russian people were neither prepared nor desirous of fighting against Japan for the Yalou forestsa problem that interested only a group of greedy capitalistsNicolas was egged on by the Kaiserwho was more than anxious to involve his neighbor in a mess in the Far Eastand thus to divert his attention from the Near East where the interests of the Triple Alliance demanded the eliminationor at least the weakeningof the formidable ally of FranceThe Czar caught the baitand was rewarded with the Treaty of Portsmouthwhich put an end to Russia s ambitions in Manchuria and crippled her international prestigeto the immediate advantage of Germany and AustriaThe defeated bear was forcibly driven to introspectionHer navy almost totally destroyedher army decimated and demoralizedher population torn by revolutions and civil warfareRussia faced a Herculian taskThe government was confronted with a double problemto quench the internal conflagrationand to get ready forretaliation The first aim was more or less achievedthe revolutionists were

institution elected and managed practically by the Czar s ministersWith feverish energy the government set out to carry through its second purposeThe Dumas were forced to sanction gigantic war budgetsand the entire bureaucratic state was thrown into a crucible of radicalsweeping reformsThe reconstruction of the army has become the all important issueWithout naming the potential enemyall partiesexcept the Socialistsagreed that Russia must concentrate her forces on the building up in the fastest possible time of an enormousefficientmodern armyThe majority of the people differed with the governmenthoweveron one pointas to who should carry out the great taskThe people have had little confidence in the capability of the bureaucracy for self reformationthey have applied to them the Russian saying Only the grave can change the hunchback Alexander Guchkovwhile president of the Duma and later as an influential private citizenhas revealed the hopelessly rotten state of affairs in the military and civil organization of the countrymanaged by unscrupulous thieves and graftersby useless sinecure holders from among the nobility and the royal familyThe reorganization of the statepointed out MrGuchkov and his followersmust be taken from the hands of the effeminate and imbecile Grand Dukesand entrusted to representatives of the nationFor such a heresy Guchkov had to resign from his post as head of theparliament and the work of reconstruction continued to be handled by the old chinovnicksthe puppets of the Czar and of his uncles and cousinsPublic opinion in Russia has been crystallizing simultaneously with military preparation and diplomatic negotiationsAustria s annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina gave Russian diplomacy the gravest slap since the Berlin Congress Wilhelm s threat to appear inshining armorto the assistance of his ally compelled foreign minister Sasonov to withdraw his protest against Austria s actThe humiliation was felt deeply by all classes the Russian people have come to regard Germany as their bitterest foeresponsible not only for their past and present military and diplomatic fiascoesbut largely responsible also for the internal retrogressive policy of their governmentIt has been widely known that during the last revolution the Kaiser had counselled Nicolasunrelenting firmness and had even offered toloanhis army for the suppression of the uprisingThe popularity of the present war in Russia is thus explainedThe conservatives see in it an opportunity to strengthen the power of the autocracy through drummed up patriotism and loyalty to the thronethe liberals hope that with the defeat of Germany there will come an end to thedark influenceof the Prussian retrogrades on Russia s policythe masses are eager to fight against theAntichrists the enemies of the Slavs and of the Slavonic churchWhatever the outcome of this war may beit has done inestimable service for the awakening of RussiaThe country has been elevated and purified morally and nationallyThe abolition of vodkathe unification of differing parties and of hostile racesthe liberal concessions granted by the governmentthese are the few tangible results of the war that can be checked off alreadyBut there is considerably more to comeThe ignominious failures of the army have pointed a burning finger of accusation against the real enemy of the peoplethe bureaucracyThe Russian soldiers have fought like lions led by assesThe shameless lack of munitionthe use of antiquated gunsthe wretched equipment of the soldiersthe inefficiency of field hospitalsthe continuing graft in giving out contractsthe presence in the army of such time proved nonentities as General Rennenkampf and other Manchurian celebritiesthese facts have shown to the people that the Czar and his clique have forgotten everything and have learned nothingThe general dissatisfaction in army circles and among the civilians may bring about a storm that will sweep away the tottering throne of Nicolas RomanovThis is not a mere theoretic conjectureSince 1904 an intense revolutionary propaganda has been carried on within the army and navyThe germ of rebellion has penetrated not only the common soldierswho are largely recruited from among the down trodden peasants and workingmenbut also the officerswho have learned a good deal in the last ten yearsA military coup d etat after the model of the Young Turks has become a popular idea with the intelligent officers who cannot fail to see that the autocratic régime is a detrimental anachronismThere have been persistent rumors about the high ambitions of the ex Supreme CommanderGrand Duke Nicolas is a happy exception among the degenerated RomanovsHe has been long considered as thestrong man and therefore feared and opposed to by the Court camarillaNecessity compelled the Czar to appoint him commander his appointment was insistently recommended by Joffre and KitchenerUnlike Kuropatkinthe Grand Duke refused to follow dictations from PetrogradWhen in early spring he received an order from the Czar to evacuate Warsawthe commander telegraphed back that he was willing to obeybut that he would move his army against the capitalThe order was recalledThe fact that he was recently removed from his post and exiled to Caucasia shows the growing fears of the Czarwho has lost his head and is hewing the branch on which he is still seatedThe Grand Duke had performed a difficultalthough not very spectacular task that of saving the unarmed army from the iron grip of the GermansPetrograd demandedaction as it did ten years ago from KuropatkinNow that the Czar has assumed the commandership of the army one may expect rapidactions Sedans and Tzusimas and an early peace treaty as honorable as that of PortsmouthThe sentiments of the population were characteristically voiced by the Jewish member of the DumaFriedmanIn his speech he recounted the unbelievable atrocities of the Russian authorities performed over the Jews in the war zoneYet he saidIt is true we are without rightswe are oppressed beyond enduranceBut we know the foundation of the evilIt emanates from these benchespointing to the Ministers We are persecuted by the Russian government and not by the Russian peopleIt is not to be wondered atthereforethat we are content to bind our fate loyally and faithfully with the fate of the Russian peoplewhatever may be done to us by the Russian government The best of Russia are unanimously The Little Review determined thatthe foundation of the evilmust goIn the last few weeks various bodies of the Russian commonwealth have issued grave resolutions condemning the government and demanding democratization of the stateA revolution seems inevitablebutto repeata military revolution is most likely to take placeThe bulk of the virile population is within the fighting ranksand it is therein the armythat the national nerve pulsates at presentWhether it be Grand Duke Nicolasor another capable and popular leaderit is to be expected that this time the army will pronounce the verdict over the imbecile Czar and will cleanse the Aagean stables of the corrupted bureaucracyKSophomoric

disputingtechniques valuesand standards in regard to paintings that somehow seem to live outside any limits pedants have placedOut from the noise the voice of the artist arises with a strength and clearness in words similar to the quality of his paintingsWriting in the February Craftsman of this yeartelling of his workhis ideasand hispeople Robert Henri has this to say My love of mankind is individualI am patriotic only about what I admireand my devotion to humanity burns as brightly for Europe as for AmericaIt flames up swiftly for Mexico if I am painting the peon there it warms towards the bull fighter of Spain if in spite of its cruelty there is that element in his art which I find beautiful it intensifies before the Irish peasant whose lovepoetrysimplicityand humor have enriched my existence just as completely as though these people were of my own country and my own hearthstoneEverywhere I see at times this beautiful expression of the dignity of life to which I respond with a wish to preserve this beauty of humanity for my friends to enjoy The Chinese American girl who has found coquetry in new freedom the peona symbol of a destroyed civilization in Mexicoand the Indian who works as one in slavery and dreams as a man in still places all their lives are in their expressionin their eyestheir movements or they are not worth translating into art He very simply tells what he feels about techniquewhich ought to quiet the objection to his or any individual s methods Technique is merely a languageand as I grow older and see more and more clearly I have but one intention and that is to make this language as clear and simple and sincere as is humanly possible It is a language of no value for its own sake It must be so translucent that it can be forgottenthe value of the subject shining through it A woman who sat for Henri last year for her portrait has this to say of him in a recent letterTo me he is quite the most wonderful man among American artistsso very big yet simple as a childso very human yet utterly unconscious of his humanityHe is much like Whitman only more tendermore subtleTo Henri life is his artThat s what makes him truly greatThat s what made him go to the Ferrer School and awaken talent and even genius where no one else would have seen anything to awakenAs a teacher Henri is perhaps even greater than as a painterI heard him explain things to his class only twicebut I have never heard anything more fascinating and vividHis greatest worthhoweveris his sense of freedomhis fervent belief that only freedom can bring out the best in the individualHe is really an anarchist though he does not label himself one And thus the exhibit of twenty five paintings at the Art Institute takes on a broader and more beautiful airIt becomes human and alive even though the noise from the studios is confusingPaul Manship also has a room at the Art InstituteGreekAsyrianJapaneseChineseEgyptianItalianRomanGothicand what notbut whereoh whereis Paul

printed many enconiums of your magazineI shall watch with curiosity to see if you print thisTHE WEAKNESS OF REVOLT DrWeilNew YorkThe spirit of revolt is compounded from many causesEven in the average young girl of whom MrHecht writes in the August LITTLE REVIEW it arises as much from her digestion as from her incomplete physical functioningas much from her work as from her leisureas much from her friends as from her freshnessMrHecht would be the first to admit thatwould he be equally willing to admit that it meets death variouslyHe talks only of the family as the snuffer for the flameThis does not mean that he excludes other causesbut it does mean that he has overemphasized oneIt is trueas MrHecht insiststhat the American family tends to quell revoltThe battle of the generations is as old as the racethe family has always struggled to bring the rebel into line for its own preservationBut that struggle in all its various shades of acuteness has become a truism of modern thoughtthanks to a multiplex modern dramaa scientific sociologyand even the daily pressWhy discuss the subject only to dwell again heavily on the obviousThe problem is far more complicatedThe verdict of guilt against the family grows monotonous when returned at every inquestTo place a single responsible cause for any tremor to revolt that dies abortive is to lack subtletyAlong with each verdict against the family there is also a verdict against the individualOne is not to blame if she is not a geniusbut if even her greatest emotions are somewhat lacking in poignancythe fluctuating spirit of restlesness in her never reaches the heights which demand actionAlong with each verdict against the family there is also a verdict against the quality of the revolutionary spiritNot only are its causal factors weak and fluctuatingbut the very vagueness which to MrHecht constitutes its charm spells also its damnationA spirit of restlessness isin itselfnothing about which one can go to the hilltops and shoutand when it crystalizes in some particular issuea booka picturea small individual rightthe object often seems too trivial to struggle forTo be sure the principle is not a small thingbut a principle is abstract and when it confronts a concrete bit of sufferingit fades by contrastThe sordid bread and butter difficulties to be faced by one standing wholly alonethe scathing force of public opinionthe pain of others whichwhen you love themis pain to you these are realities which only the truly big souls dare to faceFor most of us the spirit of revolt is too diffuse even to demand actionand for most of the rest action is too divine a consummation to be compassed by our weak human spiritNot to any external cause reallybut to an inherent lack in usis it due that we slowly grow complacentinstead of crusading worthily in behalf of libertyAlice GroffPhiladelphiaThe most of you publishers are such unspeakable Kaisers of Kultur that you treat the geniuses who make you what you are as insignificant
