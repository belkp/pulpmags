Smoke of the leaves in autumn another Smoke of a steel mill roof or a battleship funnel They all go up in a line with a smokestack Or they twist in the slow twist of the wind  If the north wind comes they run to the south  If the west wind comes they run to the east By this sign all smokes know each other  Smoke of the fields in spring and leaves in autumn Smoke of the finished steel chilled and blue By the oath of work they swear I know you  Hunted and hissed from the center Deep down long ago when God made us over   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Deep down are the cinders we came from You and I and our heads of smoke  Some of the smokes God dropped on the job Cross on the sky and count our years And sing in the secrets of our numbers Sing their dawns and sing their evenings Sing an old log fire song  You may put the damper up You may put the damper down The smoke goes up the chimney just the same  Smoke of a city sunset skyline Smoke of a country dusk horizon They cross on the sky and count our years  Smoke of a brick red dust Winds on a spiral Out of the stacks  For a hidden and glimpsing moon This said the bar iron shed to the blooming mill This is the slang of coal and steel The day gang hands it to the night gang The night gang hands it back  Stammer at the slang of this Let us understand half of it   In the rolling mills and sheet mills In the harr and boom of the blast fires The smoke changes its shadow And men change their shadow A nigger a wop a bohunk changes A bar of steel it is only  Smoke at the heart of it smoke and the blood of a man A runner of fire ran in it ran out ran somewhere else And left smoke and the blood of a man And the finished steel chilled and blue  So fire runs in runs out runs somewhere else again And the bar of steel is a gun a wheel a nail a shovel A rudder under the sea a steering gear in the sky And always dark in the heart and through it  Smoke and the blood of a man Pittsburg Youngstown Gary they make their steel with men  In the blood of men and the ink of chimneys The smoke nights write their oaths Smoke into steel and blood into steel Homestead Braddock Birmingham they make their steel  with men Smoke and blood is the mix of steel  The birdmen drone in the blue it is steel a motor sings and zooms   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Steel barb wire around The Works Steel guns in the holsters of the guards at the gates of The Works  Steel ore boats bring the loads clawed from the earth by steel lifted and lugged by arms of steel sung on its way by the clanking clam shells  The runners now the handlers now are steel they dig and clutch and haul they hoist their automatic knuckles from job to job they are steel making steel  Fire and dust and air fight in the furnaces the pour is timed the billets wriggle the clinkers are dumped Liners on the sea skyscrapers on the land diving steel in the sea climbing steel in the sky  Finders in the dark you Steve with a dinner bucket you Steve clumping in the dusk on the sidewalks with an evening paper for the woman and kids you Steve with your head wondering where we all end up  Finders in the dark Steve I hook my arm in cinder sleeves we go down the street together it is all the same to us you Steve and the rest of us end on the same stars we all wear a hat in hell together in hell or heaven  Smoke nights now Steve Smoke smoke lost in the sieves of yesterday Dumped again to the scoops and hooks today   Carl Sandburg  Smoke like the clocks and whistles always Smoke nights now To morrow something else  Luck moons come and go Five men swim in a pot of red steel Their bones are kneaded into the bread of steel Their bones are knocked into coils and anvils And the sucking plungers of sea fighting turbines Look for them in the woven frame of a wireless station  So ghosts hide in steel like heavy armed men in mirrors Peepers skulkers they shadow dance in laughing tombs They are always there and they never answer  One of them said I like my job the company is good to me America is a wonderful country One Jesus my bones ache the company is a liar this is a free country like hell One I got a girl a peach we save up and go on a farm and raise pigs and be the boss ourselves And the others were roughneck singers a long ways from home Look for them back of a steel vault door  They laugh at the cost They lift the birdmen into the blue It is steel a motor sings and zooms   In the subway plugs and drums In the slow hydraulic drills in gumbo or gravel Under dynamo shafts in the webs of armature spiders They shadow dance and laugh at the cost  The ovens light a red dome Spools of fire wind and wind Quadrangles of crimson sputter The lashes of dying maroon let down Fire and wind wash out the slag Forever the slag gets washed in fire and wind  The anthem learned by the steel is  Do this or go hungry Look for our rust on a plow Listen to us in a threshing engine razz Look at our job in the running wagon wheat  Fire and wind wash at the slag Box cars clocks steam shovels churns pistons boilers scissors Oh the sleeping slag from the mountains the slag heavy pig iron will go down many roads  Men will stab and shoot with it and make butter and tunnel rivers and mow hay in swaths and slit hogs and skin beeves and steer airplanes across North America Europe Asia round the world   Hacked from a hard rock country broken and baked in mills and smelters the rusty dust waits Till the clean hard weave of its atoms cripples and blunts the drills chewing a hole in it The steel of its plinths and flanges is reckoned O God in one one millionth of an inch  Once when 1 saw the curves of fire the rough scarf women dancing Dancing out of the flues and smoke stacks flying hair of fire flying feet upside down  Buckets and baskets of fire exploding and chortling fire running wild out of the steady and fastened ovens Sparks cracking a harr harr huff from a solar plexus of  rock ribs of the earth taking a laugh for themselves  Ears and noses of fire gibbering gorilla arms of fire gold mud pies gold bird wings red jackets riding purple mules scarlet autocrats tumbling from the humps of camels assassinated czars straddling vermillion balloons  I saw then the fires flash one by one good by then smoke smoke And in the screens the great sisters of night and cool stars sitting women arranging their hair Waiting in the sky waiting with slow easy eyes waiting  and half murmuring Since you know all and I know nothing tell me what I dreamed last night   Pearl cobwebs in the windy rain in only a flicker of wind are caught and lost and never known again  A pool of moonshine comes and waits but never waits long the wind picks up loose gold like this and is gone  A bar of steel sleeps and looks slant eyed on the pearl cobwebs the pools of moonshine sleeps slant eyed a million years sleeps with a coat of rust a vest of moths a shirt of gathering sod and loam  The wind never bothers a bar of steel The wind picks only pearl cobwebs pools of moonshine  TANGIBLES  Washington August I918  I have seen this city in the day and the sun I have seen this city in the night and the moon And in the night and the moon I have seen a thing this city  gave me nothing of in the day and the sun  The float of the dome in the day and the sun is one thing The float of the dome in the night and the moon is another thing In the night and the moon the float of the dome is a dream   whisper a croon of a hope Not today child not today lover maybe tomorrow child maybe tomorrow lover  Can a dome of iron dream deeper than living men  Can the float of a shape hovering among tree tops can this speak an oratory sad singing and red beyond the speech of the living men  A mother of men a sister a lover a woman past the dreams of the living Does she go sad singing and red out of the float of this dome  There is something here men die for  NIGHT MOVEMENT NEW YORK  In the night when the sea winds take the city in their arms And cool the loud streets that kept their dust noon and  afternoon In the night when the sea birds call to the lights of the city The lights that cut on the skyline their name of a city In the night when the trains and wagons start from a long  way off For the city where the people ask bread and want letters In the night the city lives too the day is not all In the night there are dancers dancing and singers singing And the sailors and soldiers look for numbers on doors In the night the sea winds take the city in their arms   LOSERS  If I should pass the tomb of Jonah I would stop there and sit for awhile Because I was swallowed one time deep in the dark And came out alive after all  If I pass the burial spot of Nero I shall say to the wind Well well I who have fiddled in a world on fire I who have done so many stunts not worth doing  I am looking for the grave of Sinbad too I want to shake his ghost hand and say Neither of us died very early did we  And the last sleeping place of Nebuchadnezzar When I arrive there I shall tell the wind You ate grass I have eaten crow Who is better off now or next year  Jack Cade John Brown Jesse James There too I could sit down and stop for awhile I think I could tell their headstones God let me remember all good losers  I could ask people to throw ashes on their heads In the name of that sergeant at Belleau Woods Walking into the drumfires calling his men Come on you Do you want to live forever   ACCOMPLISHED FACTS  Every year Emily Dickinson sent one friend the first arbutus bud in her garden  In a last will and testament Andrew Jackson remembered a friend with the gift of George Washington s pocket spy glass  Napoleon too in a last testament mentioned a silver watch taken from the bedroom of Frederick the Great and passed along this trophy to a particular friend  O Henry took a blood carnation from his coat lapel and handed it to a country girl starting work in a bean bazaar and scribbled Peach blossoms may or may not stay pink in city dust  So it goes Some things we buy some not Tom Jefferson was proud of his radishes and Abe Lincoln blacked his own boots and Bismarck called Berlin a wilderness of brick and newspapers  So it goes There are accomplished facts Ride ride ride on in the great new blimps Cross unheard of oceans circle the planet When you come back we may sit by five hollyhocks We might listen to boys fighting for marbles The grasshopper will look good to us  So it goes    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  PEOPLE WHO MUST  I put my easel on the roof of a skyscraper I painted a long while and called it a day s work The people on a corner swarmed and the traffic cop s whistle  never let up all afternoon They were the same as bugs many bugs on their way Those people on the go or at a standstill And the traffic cop a spot of blue a splinter of brass Where the black tides ran around him And he kept the street I painted a long while And called it a day s work  BAS RELIEF  Five geese

sit The law says two strangers shall eat breakfast together after  nights on the horn of an Arctic moon  CALLS  Because I have called to you as the flame flamingo calls or the want of a spotted hawk is called  because in the dusk the warblers shoot the running waters of short songs to the homecoming warblers  because the cry here is wing to wing and song to song  I am waiting waiting with the flame flamingo the spotted hawk the running water warbler  waiting for you   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  EVENING WATERFALL  What was the name you called me And why did you go so soon  The crows lift their caw on the wind And the wind changed and was lonely  The warblers cry their sleepy songs Across the valley gloaming Across the cattle horns of early stars  Feathers and people in the crotch of a treetop Throw an evening waterfall of sleepy songs  What was the name you called me And why did you go so soon  SEA WASH  The sea wash never ends The sea wash repeats repeats Only old songs Is that all the sea knows  Only the old strong songs Is that all The sea wash repeats repeats  Carl Sandburg   WINTER WIFE  The white hills smoke with snow And it is well for you Who make so poor a lover Who give my hands such little tasks to do For were the doorstep bare And the path not drifted over My heart would need no cover I should go Go and never care Fling out my arms and run Glad in the wakening sun Wild in the singing air Race with my blowing hair  But the weight of the winter is on the door And the snow has driven me near to you It might be well if you d love me more And tell me I am dear to you Although it is early to understand For how is there any knowing The road I will be going When a free wind is blowing Over the opened land  Margery Swett   A LINE A DAY FOR CERTAIN LOVERS  REMEMBRANCE  I never forgot you And I loved your silences I believed in you and yet I could not believe  I was both constant and inconstant You were faithless yet immeasurably true  A time came When your memory swung like a bright pendulum Backwards and forwards in my brain Channeling a groove  Even had I loved you I would have chosen the same way  RE ENCOUNTER  With your first word You royally out starred my sudden blazing faith What you appeared to me in that instant Will never be told  UNDERCURRENTS  There were warnings and devious oppositions Frankness simplicity And many many undercurrents   And all the while I knew that what they feared of me I had no desire to accomplish  I took as much as little all that I wanted all  I alone guessed how much it was But they blessed me sighing in their relief For how little  PREMONITIONS  Cloud upon cloud of mist Fog clouds And curtains of rain  Oh the glistening world that lay last night Beyond the narrow and indrawing circle Of this grey morning s vision  I fear some secret chemistry at work Among these shifting shrouds That stir and move repulsively Like dank old water weeds In an old and stagnant pond These dim cloud walls may well conceal Some darker crown Than the pool s white crown of fire flies  Have you no delicately colored words Does your hand possess no new grace Your eyes no cunning   To lure away this fantasy Your eyes  Your eyes  THE BRINGERS OF GIFTS  High above the city We stood and watched the boats upon the river  You had your dreams But the deeper peace that I knew at last Was not in your eyes grey depths  From the cup of my hands You drank but the remembrance of sorrow I knew but the fragrance of your spirit When the censer Lay broken at my feet  Above the city We watched the life of the river We saw the lights appear   BELSHAZZAR  We were walled about with sinister intentions And the hot sweet summer day was suddenly alive With quickening fears We knew but we shut them out As one shuts out the unbearable sunlight of the dawn   DRIFT  Two hours And the sombre long kiss of leave taking  Your eyes had accepted everything  And you sank into the long useless future While the present slowly disintegrated about us  EPILOGUE  Blue purple The shadow of the earth Circles the long horizon  My life is circled By the shadow of your love  Blue purple out there And over the blue A rose pink mist that rises That rising fades  No frail flushed aureole Crowns the shadow in my heart Unless this That you suffer a little and are often alone Because of your love That breathed upon such a pale flame  Helen Birch Bartlett   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THE BURNED HOUSE  In my house on a dry high hill  Strange things seemed stranger still  When the windows opened each morning  Oceans entered without warning  When the curtains closed each night  Entered light sweet sacred light  Long I lived there with the weather With the weather close together  Had no teacher save one chewink  Scolding madly Make you think  Thinking made me almost ill It was so high on that dry hill  And yet I thought three times a day In a hilly happy harmless way Thought the mountains were animals Thought the clouds high safe stone walls  Thought King Solomon came to call  Climbing over the cloudy wall Begged him run and catch the brook  While I got my shepherd crook  Once while I made the thick white soup Saint John sat upon the stoop   Grace Fallow Norton  Saint John pointed out to me Lotus buds on my oak tree  And then a partridge whirred in the wood Fluttering lame as a partridge should Partridge turned to a paradise bird Uttering ecstasy word by word  Till smoke of the chimney writhed withdrew And sowed a seed and rose and flew I lived in that house four years and a week Well I know whereof I speak  Smoke seed grew to a tree of flame O fire tree Red flowering shame  Devouring my dear house branch and root  Now I have eaten of one more fruit   Was it too happy was it too high  My little house close to the sky  Was it too useful was it too good  My little house beside the wood  OR DID YOU LOVE DEATH  I got your love lying  Candles at my head  I got your love dying  White on my bed   By your love gifted My life saw its span By my love lifted I rose and I ran  1 lost your love living O stinging sunshine I lost your love striving For bread and for wine  Was it love crying Farewell with faint breath Did you love me dying Or did you love death  Grace Fallow Norton  MY YEARS  My years fall softly Softly Like petals of a rose And leave me A barren withered stalk That dangles in the winds  Paul Eldridge   BRICK DUST  It s just a heap of ruin A drunken brick carouse This thing my spirit grew in That once was called a house  An attic where I scribbled Through baking summer days While street pianos nibbled At the patient Marseillaise  The spider landlord squatted In a web of dinner smells And people slowly rotted In little gossip hells  I hated all I learned there  And yet I could have cried For a little oil I burned there A little dream that died  Louisa Brooke   IN THE CEMETERY  I  I never come here but I see This same old woman wearing years That bear her head and shoulders down Her eyes are dry of tears  Each headstone has some tale for her From each to each she goes They tell her things she understands About the folks she knows  Now living things are dumb and strange She turns away her head I think she s more at home out here Among the speaking dead  II  Love of life logicians say Inherent passion of the race Yet here is what I found today Upon a woman s face  Such longing as I have not seen Was in her thoughtful eyes That watched a double bed of green Where but one sleeper lies   III  Grave diggers are a cheerful lot Fine mornin sir he said I fancied that a murmur waked  Among the listening dead  Fine mornin up above word passed From each to each below I m glad the digger spoke out loud I think they like to know  THE CONVICT  This then was the wage of hate Making shoes for men to wear Men still free to walk or wait In the sun and air  It was hate that sent him here Words a knife a heavy form Sudden silence and a fear At something wet and warm  That was all so far away Strange to think that he could feel Fear or lust or hate that day Only shoes were real  David Morton   MIRAGE  A cabin a cow and an apple tree These three things petition me Neighborly close and mine all mine The cabin covered with eglantine Cow dark red with white spots over Up to her knees in honey clover Apple tree with a bird s nest in Made where the sunlight faeries spin Silks for shade and cover  I hear them trilling the birds  Oh yes You hear the cries of the street in stress And a saffron guard with a traffic star Clutches and holds you where you are Or you would be in a pretty mess Under a motor car  Thus my tiresome old sub self Tumbling down from her closet shelf Packing her fardel of things forgot Saving me whether I will or not  It is wiser to dream all snug in bed Bed posts standing foot and head Roof tree hiding the still white cry Of a midnight moon that is going by Warding away the eerie spell   From the windows close where the dreamers lie While the velvet tread Of the Dark comes soft to the mimic dead And sweet as a sigh of Israfel  But what can one do if the visions snare In the market place when the world is there What can one do to save her soul  When without summons the films unroll  Cabin covered with eglantine Cherry red of the milken kine An apple tree and in its crest A robin s song and a robin s nest  Eufina

his bassoon Their toleration is most indulgent The one with grins The other with a smile When they are tired They go to bed together Though their dreams The one dreams of solemn white beards The other of twinkling white legs The woman Who looks in on them at times Careful not to disturb them Likes this time best She rocks their cradle for them  TO w c w M D  There has been Another death   This time

on his jubilee birthday which occurred December twenty second just as our subscribers were opening the January number Poets less forgetful sent many letters of felicitation acknowledging one and all the debt which the new movement owes to the man who published The Children of the Night in 1897 and Captain Craig in 1902 two books of poems more directly inspired from common experience and more austere in style than anything in the earlier American tradition I remember reading Captain Craig when it first appeared and looking up the earlier books absorbed by the grim relentless simplicity of this poet s art rocky almost grudging its softly toned verdure like the New England soil it sprang from In those days the young Carl Sandburg carried stray clippings of Robinson around in his pocket reading them an hundred times and digging in vain for their author in small town libraries  However our tardiness enables us to quote a few sentences from the appreciative birthday tributes printed in the New York Times of Dec 21st  Hermann Hagedorn thinks Mr Robinson the greatest living American poet Josephine Peabody calls him a master etcher of human portraits Arthur Davison Ficke speaks of his curiously penetrating insight into the laby   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  rinths of the human mind and his scrupulous artistic integrity Vachel Lindsay calls him the relentless seeker and finder of human beings a novelist distilled into a poet the high gossip among the more humorous angels and men George Sterling thinks he is the only poet whose truth is always beauty and whose beauty is always truth The venerable Edwin Markham declares As psychologist he approaches the power of Browning yet in style he is as simple as Whittier Amy Lowell says He is a poet for poets his art becomes only the more interesting the more it is studied A realist he is also a foe to materialism a skeptic his poems are full of spirituality Strong virile contemptuous of shams no one has voiced the contradictory elements of the American character better than he  And Edgar Lee Masters who was lightly called a follower of Robinson at a time when he had not yet read his work now gives him this high praise  Mr Robinson was producing poetry of importance in one of the most sterile periods of American poetry It was at a time when the Victorian era had spent itself as a creative impulse but when its manner and outlook controlled production without vitalizing it He has had the good fortune to live to this day of recognition of his work both for its own value and as an expression of today As a craftsman he is a master as a thinker he is subtle and original as an artist he has kept the faith The poets of America look to him now that he is at the meridian of his career to fight on in the war of spiritualizing America since he has inherited this day of hope after a beginning that did not bring adequate reward  As an artist he has kept the faith this is perhaps the finest word in the rich sheaf of praise offered by Mr Robin   son s fellow craftsmen Somewhat shy and aloof haughtily austere in thought and manner of life imaginatively observant impassioned like tempered steel he stands today as in his more obscure yesterdays adequate uncompromising a big man a thorough and keen visioned artist  Someone has called him the proudest figure in American letters At least he led the modern procession for his countrymen wilful and self advised he struck his own path and found no doubt with surprise that he had blazed a trail for others And now as they pass on each in his own way to his own goal he turns to the legend encrusted past and dreams of Guinevere  May he live several decades more and crowd them with poems as good as Miniver Cheevy Richard Cory or the Man from Stratford H M  CAMPION S OBSERVATIONS  Dissatisfaction with rhymed accented verse is not peculiar to our time the most robust and flourishing period of English poetry that of the Elizabethans is marked among other things by a distinct effort to abolish the mediaeval poetic forms which were based on somewhat cheap effects of alliteration stress and rhyme and to substitute a type of verse more satisfying to ears trained in music or familiar with Greek There were two reasons why this movement was abortive first too slavish a regard for Greek and especially Roman models with the result that pedantry as always dried out poetry and second the rapid deterioration of the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  tradition of English chamber music due to the Revolution and the assassination of the only art loving monarch who ever occupied the throne of England In the purely classic sense this verse was not really quantitative But that after all is unimportant the interesting fact is that a serious attempt was made to write verse in which the measure was regulated by the musical value of the syllables It was worth attempting And I believe that either our musicians must become poets or our poets must learn music before we get any real advance in lyric poetry Certainly the present sort of lyric becomes every day more intolerable  Thomas Campion the Elizabethan musician song writer and poet composed a sort of pamphlet on this subject entitled Observations on the Art of English Poesy The diction is a little quaint and euphemistic the Ciceronian construction of the sentences has a slight tang of pedantry yet the observations are so full of good sense the examples in many cases so brilliant the author s knowledge not only of poetry but of music and musical quantity is so obvious that I recommend any young poet to study this short treatise if he is desirous to quote Dr Campion of seconding the perfection of the industrious Greeks and Romans My desire is not to discuss the technical questions raised for the obvious reason that I am too ignorant of music to do so without pretention but merely to quote from the book with the hope that it may be read by some poet musician or musician poet who will do for the verse of today what Campion did for that of his time   Going over this little book one finds amusing things on rhyme He calls rhyme a vulgar and easy kind of poesy a childish titillation speaks of its fatness and declares that the facility and popularity i e cheapness commonplace of rime create as many poets as a hot summer flies Yet he is not so perverse as to deny that in attacking rhyme he must encounter many glorious enemies but adds All this and more cannot deter me from a lawful defence of perfection Yet perhaps this is his best argument  But there is yet another fault in rime altogether intolerable which is that it enforceth a man oftentimes to abjure his matter and extend a short conceit beyond all bounds of art for in qua torzains i e sonnets methinks the poet handles his subject as tyrannically as Procrustes the thief his prisoners  So he disposes of all that childish mediaeval rubbish of canzons and virelays ballades and pantoums villanelles and rondeaux and what not which however beautifully they may have been used by their inventors are merely tedious in the hands of copyists And this is only another way of saying that the original artist creates his own form or develops a form in a manner unforeseen by its inventor as Shakespeare developed Marlowe s blank verse  The first chapter on numbers in general is worth close attention And the chapters on the quantities of English words contain a great deal of matter interesting to those who consider poetry an art Campion insists on pronunciation as the only infallible test of quantity the ear not the eye or fingers as the sole judge of the harmony of words His study of the verse of his time goes into close and often   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  quaint detail but it is in this Elegy that he touches poetry its last line is worthy of Ovid  Constant to none but ever false to me Traitor still to love through thy faint desires Not hope of pity now nor vain redress Turns my griefs to tears and renewed laments   True colors deck thy cheeks false foils thy breast Frailer than thy light beauty is thy mind  The English Sapphics inevitably devoted to the queen have a displeasingly fulsome air but the other examples are quite lovely  Just beguiler Kindest love yet only chastest Royal in thy smooth denials Frowning or demurely smiling  Still my pure delight  And this Anacreontic with its Shelleyan cadence  Follow follow Though with music Armed like whirlwind Now she flies thee Time can conquer Love s unkindness Love can alter Time s disgraces Till death faint not Then but follow  But best of all in spite of obvious blemishes is Rose cheeked Laura the second example of the English Sapphic This poem so well known in Elizabethan anthologies is I believe the only piece of quantitative verse which has been allowed to creep into any of the official collections of poetry and that no doubt because its quaint sweet music like that   of old wood wind and string airs is unnoticed Had Campion written twenty more poems in quantitative verse as lovely he might have altered the form of English poetry  Rose cheeked Laura come Sing thou smoothly with thy beauty s Silent music either other  Sweetly gracing Lovely forms do flow From consent divinely framed Heaven is music and thy beauty s  Birth is heavenly These dull notes we sing Discords need for helps to grace them Only beauty purely loving  Knows no discord But still moves delight Like clear springs renewed by flowing Ever perfect ever in them  Selves eternal  Richard Aldington  THE SANDBURG SARETT RECITAL  Chicago December 21st 1919  It was a grand show There was something human and healthy and never before beheld in the way the two poets treated the audience gave the audience some credit for being human too chattered and gossiped and talked with them and had themselves as much fun as they gave to the bewildered spectators No evening clothes no dissertations on art Carl Sandburg read then brought forth a guitar of his and sang most delicately and lovably old ballads Jesse James Frankie and Albert were Sweethearts The Boll   Weevil and This Morning this Evening so Soon and Lew Sarett came out with a tom tom or what was it and shrieked and bellowed snorted squeaked and squawked chirped and warbled just like the many animals he had carefully listened to during his stay in the forests of the North west and Canada  Sandburg is a kingly reader His reading is exactly as beautiful as his poetry and his person He is one of the most completely sucessfully alive human beings I ever saw from his sturdy shoes to the tuft of hard gray hair over his granite eyes to his voice and his words from the majestic dignity of his voice to the dignity of his poems Carl Sandburg is in and out thoroughly expressive of one beauty and one glory himself  Lew Sarett recited like a versatile actor perhaps too much so his fine Indian songs But he certainly was insuperable at imitating wild animals gave us the sadness the horror the weirdness the vastness the humor of the forest as it is expressed by its worthy and heretofore misunderstood inhabitants E C  REVIEWS  BODY AND RAIMENT  Body and Raiment and Profiles from China new ed by Eunice Tietjens Alfred A Knopf The books which are easiest to review are of two sorts those which the reviewer likes extremely however tempera   mentally agreeable to him or not may be the method employed and those which he does not like but of which he finds the method the theory in some way provocative in some way either positively or negatively of momentary value The books which he finds hardest to review are those which again are neither bad enough nor good enough to compel from him a sharp reaction in taste and on the other hand those which do not greatly challenge in one direction or the other his opinions as to theory Mrs Tietjens new book Body and Raiment is for the present reviewer at any rate of the second sort Of Profiles from China there is obviously more to be said one may argue pro and con as to whether it belongs more suitably or more profitably in the category of prose or of poetry and one has to deal however that question is argued with vignettes sufficiently sharp with artistic effects which are tantalizingly of a dubiousness By George this is good one exclaims but the next line or stanza with its over emphasis or its flatness or  its superflousness or its sentimentality makes one suspect that the word of exclamatory praise was perhaps a little too quick on the wing  Body and Raiment is in some respects a better book but in many respects a less interesting one It contains a good many things which clearly deserve more than anything in Profiles to be called poetry The book as a whole entitles Mrs Tietjens to a conspicuous place among the contemporary female poets Griswold of America If she lacks the power of Miss Lowell or her richness of mind or   the delicate crystalline sharpness of H D or the grace and gentleness of Sara Teasdale she is at any rate of their company It is only when one sets about the formulation of an opinion on the book as a whole when one attempts to characterize it that one perceives how singularly little in proportion to its skill the work of Mrs Tietjens leaves any clear personal impress on one s mind  It is this fact indeed which constitutes one s sharpest impression of Body and Raiment Why is it that this book slips so soundlessly so tracelessly through one s outspread senses The work is more interesting than Sara Teas dale s more robust and varied than H D s more instinctively modulated rhythmatically and in sound color than Amy Lowell s but all three are better poets Mrs Tietjens herself offers us a clue at which we may gratefully catch in her Plaint of Complexity which stands as the Proem to the book she says  I have too many selves to know the one  In too complex a schooling was I bred  Child of too many cities who have gone  Down all bright cross roads of the world s desires  And at too many altars bowed my head  To light too many fires  In this Mrs Tietjens puts her finger on the secret She has too many selves to know the one she is as Ezra Pound has excellently put it a broken bundle of mirrors It would be superficial to say that this polymorphism is due only to the fact that Mrs Tietjens has as in her confession dipped herself too many times in too many dyes of culture   This sort of environment to use the word in its broadest sense cannot harm what one might term the salient artistic temperament it can only enrich it Many a great artist has in his formative years perforce played the chameleon The difference between the great artist or even merely the small but none the less genuine artist and the artist who is at bottom only derivative lacking in personality is simply a difference in sensibility The former type has from the very outset as a coefficient of the forces of heredity and infantile environment a sensibility markedly peculiar a sensibility which all through his life no matter how often or how richly overlaid with knowledges and conventions or on the other hand no matter how fearfully starved for food of sensation will give him a consciousness in some slight degree unlike the consciousness of any other No one can say of course whether it is from this over acuteness of sensibility that the sort of frustration arises which gives an individual that hunger of one kind or another which compels him forever to seek satisfaction in color or sound or image or rhythm or the ordering of masses in architecture or of ideas in thought but it is clear that in whatever relation to each other those two factors are conspicuously present and it should be equally clear that for our immediate purpose the matter of sensibility is of paramount importance  For what one gets back to ultimately in the case of Mrs Tietjens is the lack of any very marked idiosyncracy of sensibility This lack must have been present from the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  outset and it is one which she will find it difficult if not impossible to overcome One by no means implies in taking this position that she lacks talent we are involved indeed simply in drawing what is at best a very dubious line between talent and genius Of talent it is evident that Mrs Tietjens has a great deal Her sense of rhythm is firm rich varied and is combined with a well developed sense of orotundity the sense of sound values as distinct from rhythm values In this regard her work compares very favorably with that done by any other woman now writing verse in America But this unfortunately is insufficient one demands more one demands just that so slight amount of difference just that personal variation on the skilful norm which sets the true artist apart This Mrs Tietjens lacks when one examines her work closely in rhythm and even more conspicuously in other regards What is it that her sensibility has given her to say what is it that her frustrations have compelled her to say Nothing one confesses reluctantly very unique The perceptions are good normal sometimes charming but never very acute the moods are recognizable but never rich And all this is tantamount to saying that Mrs Tietjens seldom gets very far from a skilful rhythmical treatment of the sentimental in terms of  the commonplace  This sounds a little harsh and one hastens to say that there is much pleasure to be derived from To my Friend become Famous from a number of the shorter lyrics in the book and from some of the paraphrases from the Japanese   The Bacchante to her Babe is enthusiastic but uncouthly sentimental and like many of Mrs Tietjens poems has about it a kind of immature sententiousness ditto The Steam Shovel and The Drug Clerk An index to Mrs Tietjens incompleteness as an artist is the fact that what would otherwise be the most original and perfect thing in the book The Tepid Hour is robbed of its force by the repetition throughout at the end of each stanza of the first line At this point it is proper to observe that Mrs Tietjens might object to this and that she may be right the critic too has his limitations Conrad Aiken  KIPLING TODAY  The Years Between by Rudyard Kipling Doubleday Page  amp Co  Every poet worth the name has of course desired to be known simply for the special beauty and truth he expresses and not for something extraneous that can be got up about him I am that which unseen comes and sings sings sings says Whitman in characterizing the Poet  Too long now and for too many listeners all Kipling s poetry has been uttered in the presence of a Doppelgánger in the presence of his former fame The reader who will exorcise the Doppelgánger of Kipling s fame and sit down to listen to that which unseen comes and sings sings sings in The Years Between will be richly rewarded by the gifts of a great artist   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  You may agree with him You may disagree with him You probably must disagree with him in some respects For he writes about the world today Everybody s world About this no two people have the same opinion  But as a musical characterization of the wild ordinary face of this present civilization cruel poor and splendid the power and interest of the book s poetry will hold almost anyone I believe who ever thinks about what we are all here for where  Across a world where all men grieve And grieving strive the more The great days range like tides and leave Our dead on every shore  The sorrow of the globe pours through the book s pages The reminiscence of lighter familiar hours laughs through them Their art is free from any tone of exclusions  And Amorite or Eremite or General Averagee The people Lord Thy people are good enough for me And when they bore me over much I will not shake mine ears Recalling many thousand such whom I have bored to tears And when they labor to impress I will not doubt nor scoff Since I myself have done no less and sometimes pulled if off Yea as we are and we are not and we pretend to be Thy people Lord Thy people are good enough for me  Kipling has the gift of using any form with sufficient flexibility to deprive it of the air of a literary attitude His Epitaphs for Soldiers Spartan in their classicism remain marvels in the directness and conciseness of their use of English the tragic finality of their brief sentences and sharp caesuras Here are two of them   On the first hour of my first day In the front trench I fell Children in boxes at a play Stand up to watch it well  My name my speech my self I had forgot My wife and children came I knew them not I died My mother followed At her call And on her bosom I remembered all  The writer of this review always Ishmaelitish in her position in the pages of POETRY may as well come forward boldly now and assert that she has always believed that as the elder Beaumont said  Our Saxon shortness hath peculiar grace In choice of words fit for the ending place  In that excellent faculty of our language Kipling has an infinite cunning The wild rack and smother of the sea songs the ugly creeping story of danger these are among the musical masterpieces of the collection  The magic of the book has many facets On a rainy evening about two years ago someone said There is a poem of Kipling s in that magazine I opened it to read the magnificent tribute to Bunyan now included in The Years Between I shall never forget the flash and force of John Bunyan as he rose before me in Chicago on that rainy evening in Kipling s graphic music The real Bunyan his achievement his strength his penetration burns with life in the poem s forthright eloquence burns with life but the life of quiet speech of comment forcibly unpretentious as it were not too proud to be amusing and with the coals all banked   There is something in the poem too that takes you home  and comforts you for all the short comings of your race  A pedlar from a hovel  The lowest of the low  The father of the Novel  Salvation s first Defoe  Eight blinded generations  Ere Armageddon came  He showed us how to meet it  And Bunyan was his name  Whitman our greatest poet wishing peculiarly as has been  said to be known as a Bard has pointed out that he is not  the wind nor the red sun  But I am that which unseen comes and sings sings sings Which babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the land Which the birds know in the woods mornings and evenings And the shore sands know and the hissing wave  Whitman s fame was undoubtedly somewhat obscured  in his life in America by the rush and strong tide of his  music its sustained power of recognizable repetition of  flowing on and on Close on the wave comes the wave  behind The taste of our land especially the taste of  poetic culture in coteries has always rather feared Bards  has always rather edged away from the undisguised musical  enjoyment of poetry and regarded this as a manifestation  demanding some disparagement and not quite sophisticated  nor refined What the birds know in the woods mornings  and evenings is thought to be too obvious not subtle enough  Those who do not care for singing feel some dubiousness  about the intellectuality the greatness the genius of that  which unseen comes and sings sings sings   Kipling Today  It would be better for all such people not to read The Years Between It is all by a Bard But if you like to hark to all its deep rhymed subtleties and over tones beyond prose intimations to listen to that which unseen comes and sings in its pages its music will tell you I think many tales of the fire of our world that men will always remember  Edith Franklin Wyatt  MR BYNNER S PHILOSOPHY OF LOVE  The Beloved Stranger by Witter Bynner Alfred A Knopf  In an age of experiment it is natural to discuss matters of technique and it is always natural to fear being taken in again by a poet who has once hoaxed his public Yet critics of The Beloved Stranger have not noted that the poems in this book express a philosophy of love which invites comment rather more than their technique or than the suggestion of Mr Reedy in his preface that their author may have a double personality and be a case for psychiatry  Mr Bynner once wrote a poem which contained this stanza Single your love you lose your love You cloak her face with clay Now mine I never quite discern And never look away In The Beloved Stranger we see how the passage of time  affects such a way of taking lave  The book is divided into three parts In the first the  Stranger is ideal and his substance is indicated by verses like  I have ventured many people to see you   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  and  At the first footfall of an uncouth season  You migrate with a sudden wing sweep  To Beauty  With you there is no meantime  You are now After such elevated emotion the poet a past master in the art of relief relaxes and grows cheerful and indeed fantastic in the second section of the book called Divertise ment Here occur the phrases which have distressed reviewers such as  From my hearse of winter  From my coffin of you  I start up and wave my hand and  The look in your eyes  Was as soft as the underside of soap   And I left before you could love me  It may be that as expressions of the heart s resentment at the tyranny of the ideal and its hasty retreat in untoward circumstances to the protection of that tyranny such phrases are too vivid In the third division the Beloved Stranger ceases to be ideal for his apparition is identified with successive persons at no small cost of bitterness for the poet  Into me even now as I hold you Roll all the waste spaces of the world Desert after desert  It is hard to see how things could end otherwise if in one s amorous progress one starts out with the ideal only to lose it in reality It was not so in the philosophy of Plato but who can deny that Platonic love leaves much of the   map of emotion uncharted and free therefore to raise distressing phantoms in the mind From it as from other philosophies of passion the soul will continue to make brave and romantic flights to discover if there be regions more congenial  The successes and failures of this particular flight should be of interest to the student of love The general reader may feel in its telling phrases and its fragmentary charm that The Beloved Stranger is more a discreet lover s notebook than anything else As such it ought to find a welcome place in the imaginative literature of the period  Haniel Long  CALIBAN S LOVE MAKING  Scepticisms by Conrad Aiken Alfred A Knopf  How much or little of a poet soever he be Mr Aiken is decisively a critic when he writes about poets By critic I mean a person who like Mr Aiken publishes a book of too many pages wherein neither the author nor the subject is presented His subject and Mr Aiken could not somehow get along and they have divorced severed both lose their significance and physiognomy And that should certainly suffice for me to say if it weren t for the fact that this mimicking and swaggering scientism people reverentially call Criticism and pay more attention to than to the works of art themselves  Mr Aiken by calling his book Scepticisms discredits it himself and thereby thinks that it has become safer to for   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  ward it This kind of compromise with truth fails because of the claims the book makes It is directed obviously to readers and it claims some kind of recognition But if scepticism means as in this case lack of faith in one s own concern if it means demureness if it betrays an insufficient stimulus then its scope and therefore its claims can never be sufficiently limited  In the Apologia pro Specie sua which precedes the notes the author gives us some hope shows some virility when he threatens to appear with his prejudices to speak as a poet of his competitors But the very term apology ought to have put us on guard and also the bashful and canting tone of such an apology In fact he fails to keep his promise this is entirely irremediably hopelessly only the book of a critic  For it is all a discussion of appearances and not a presentation of poems and poets seen and felt The basis of such a discussion is as usual an obvious borrowed conception of the beautiful of the musical of the poetical of the ugly Now beauty is never one and the same and therefore one may not have a conception of it also beauty is always one and the same being infinite one has moments of knowledge of it knows it intuitively just as the poets know it It cannot be measured there are no yardsticks of infinite length  And besides into the critic s own field one could bring this suggestion that this obsolete phraseology of technique rhythm method realism classicism etc etc has been voted down a hundred times already by the aestheticians themselves Critics ought to be more consistent and know aesthetics more   if they cannot know art better From Aristotle to Benedetto Croce art has bothered the philosophers Philosophers wish to get rid by means of the intellect of the good things of the earth among which art is So several of them sat and thought till their brains were mouldy trying to figure out what was the matter with it At any rate whatever logic be it has been ascertained that certain problems have been settled for good that to scuffle about subject matter beauty in art beautiful art music in poetry the seven arts rhythm school symbol metaphor genus and species is not to be allowed any more not even to critics and aestheticians These words it has been ascertained commit even the best aesthetician  Instead of beautiful things to be looked at with love or unbeautiful things to be looked at with hatred Mr Aiken sees in poems merely words and their array or disarray He continually speaks of form as separate from the words themselves and their meanings The words of a poem came to be together they were not put together and one cannot abstract a word from its meaning and sound any more than one can abstract the pink on the cheeks of a lovely girl from that girl s loveliness Mr Aiken measures lines and finds them an inch short or an inch long when he has measured two thousand of them he publishes a book And how does a critic know that a line is an inch short if he hasn t in his heart or mind the line as it should have been And if he has then he is a poet if Aiken would tell us what poetry is to him if he would say for instance that the Woolworth   Building is rendered by three trochees and five anapaests and call the bluff of the poet who does otherwise then his criticism would be a struggle between his personality and that of the poet he criticizes If instead of skipping around these dancing men endeavoring to measure the circumference of their calves and the diameter of their knee caps he would stand alongside them and tell us See this is the difference they dance and I am stiff and still then his performance would prove at least informatory But he does that only a little and unconsciously his personality succeeds only in trammeling him it doesn t even let him be a conscientiously bad critic Thus he apologizes for his bias prejudices temperament  Bias prejudice temperament these are not vices they are a person s constitution they are the person It is only the artists that trust to these forces within them for one could say of every poem that it is a prejudice as of every love affair that it is the outcome of a bias The amount of faith one gives to these supposed vices is the measure of one s greatness temperament if one have faith in it becomes whimsicality liveliness power force bias becomes will prejudice becomes Evangel New Word When a man cannot give sufficient credit to these qualities in him it is because they are scanty and weak and he is aware of their falling short And all weakness resorts to sentimentality thus we see Mr Aiken apologizing for not being an absolute judge  The genesis and the sum of my objections is this book is formless Mr Kostyleff who gave Aiken much of his   style and many of his ideas is partly responsible no doubt for Aiken s bad writing Here is a sample of Kostyleff s   The verbal discharge The emotional shock finds in the poet preformed cerebral mechanisms Automatic discharge of verbal reflexes along chains of association set in motion by a chance occurrence  See the verbal reflexes discharging by the shore of the chain and see the chain trotting on And they say that the symbolists use a strange language Mr Kostyleff is Mr Aiken s conscience or I should rather say judging from his weird shape he is Aiken s nightmare  One of the outstanding features of Scepticisms explanatory of the title is Mr Aiken s reiteration  But why isn t this prose instead of poetry It is lovely prose but not poetry it s only very rhythmical prose  He says that or something like that of every major poet and of most of the minor ones well every poet writes prose in this country it s an American custom I guess  Shakespeare didn t write those plays they were written by another man called Shakespeare  We have beheld another performance by Caliban criticism is creative when it is the art of the arts and then it is either poetry or beautiful prose as you please to call it but beautiful Otherwise criticism is an ugly soul trying to touch a beautiful one using all the tricks the mechanics the devices and the deceptions of an ugly soul It s Caliban and Ariel will never have anything to do with him E C   POETRY A Magazine of Verse CORRESPONDENCE  FOR ARMENIAN ORPHANS  The Near East Relief 1 Madison Avenue New York asks us to print the following poem in behalf of

from a distinguished poet  The new Yeats poem is a beauty He is the one supreme artist writing in English today I am always awed by the sharp perfection and immediate honesty of every poeta of his This is   The Later Yeats  especially true of his work of the last few years It seems far finer to me than the soft gray blue poems of the earlier Yeats I cannot understand for the life of me why the critics have not given The Wild Swans of Coole a more generous reception Not one in America really caught the full measure of its beauty Louis Untermeyer and Marguerite Wilkinson were the most favorable but even they were somewhat regretful and explanatory Why What more could you want than the perfection of music the economy the terrible honesty of these lyrics They are as casual and as cruel as life itself and if they are disillusioned they compensate us by flashes of radiant new loveliness and a richness of experience that no other poet could share with us Yeats doesn t write for an audience thank heaven He is aloof enough and arrogant enough to be able to speak of himself without remembering that we are listening We were talking to his father recently in New York He was
