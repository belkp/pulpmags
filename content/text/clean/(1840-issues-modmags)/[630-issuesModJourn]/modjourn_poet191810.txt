Sept 30th 1917 and although the endowment has been partly resub scribed for another period this Fund is insufficient and expenses are constantly increasing The art of poetry requires if it is to advance not only special sympathy from a discriminating public but also endowment similar to that readily granted to the other arts All who believe in the general purpose and policy of this magazine and recognize the need and value of such an organ of the art are invited to assist thus in maintaining it   VOL XIII No I  OCTOBER 1918  FATHERLAND  OR what would a man die For what would a man be dead In April go down and lie In a low bed And when spring was passing by Pull the covers over his head  Did he know his house would be dark The window curtains drawn When the morning star was a spark On the ashes of the dawn Chilly and very low With no door swinging back and forth Where he may pass and go   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Over the shining swarth With the winds singing to and fro And the redbirds winging north Would he lie like a straight ash stick When the roots around him stir And the other dead are quick The daisy and ragweed and burr Lie still though he hear in his night The wind blowing on to June The silence of ripe sunlight Over the grass at noon The stars like bees overhead In the apple trees and the plums For what would a man be dead Now April comes  Do men love Fatherland So that they die for these Night in blue valleys and The breakers of blue seas Clouds marching caravanned And star acquainted trees Cities time s made grey And talkative and wise Hills so old they may Watch pain with patient eyes Young mountan tops that play At touching the skies   Eloise Robinson  The heavens like a bent hand The brown earth underneath Are these his Fatherland For which man stops his breath Takes off his body and Goes down to sit with Death  Or is it this that rouses His heart to go Do streets of little houses Keep haunting him so With their secrets like small caged birds That flutter and fly at the sill And their ghosts of long dead words That are walking still With their cool white beds for sleep And their tables spread And their tented roofs that keep Out the curious moon overhead  For these what man would end His own fire and lamp light His thought that is his friend And sits by his hearth at night His old acquainted clothes And the sweet taste of bread All of the things he knows Go down in the earth and be dead   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  No this is Fatherland For which men lifting up Life toss it on the sand Like water from a cup A little land that has Truth round it like a sea Where dreams are many as The leaves are on a tree And stars grow in the grass For men to touch and see A little holy land Within all hearts of men The earth holds in her hand There he is citizen With high heroic things With faiths and loyalties With deeds that put on wings And songs that sing of these With sacrifice though it be For a mistaken dream Justice and mercy Alive with a little gleam In the earth of men who say They have rooted it from the sod And taken another way And got them another God  From mountains of the moon April has come once more   Eloise Robinson  But April nor May nor June Will ever find his door He lies so quiet now In puzzlement how death Can be so kind and how Lightly he draws his breath Almost afraid to stir Lest he find his dreaming vain He drinks of wonder there As green leaves drink the rain I think he was not sad T o feel his weight of clay Nor sorry that he had Lost April s way He had such glory in His closing eyes He needs no stars to spin And bubble in clear skies No young south wind that leaps Singing no April flowers Within his house he keeps A greater spring than ours   Eloise Robinson  POETRY A Magazine of Verse  WAR SEQUENCE  PRELUDE  I thought Surely of those in battle one bearing the impulse of the years before the splendid sunset would create a song A song of war  But none not one has spoken And the singers die fighting in silence comrade by comrade fall leaving above their death no Marseillaise  I thought  My people finding perhaps their freedom in a war for freedom might find also utterance singing of the rite of hecatombs offered to greater than a god  But none not one has spoken Over France the voice of France is Rheims a threnody graven in silence Yet the song to break the anguish of that silence the life song uttered not the dirge of Rheims  THE MARNE  Within that secret place Waste land where the rivers run red   Cloyd Head  Bearing the blood of the dead To the charnel sea They build a temple and a mystery A freedom such as none may ever share Who have not lived with Death Who have not killed  Untempered passion building as earth must build Through uttermost destruction reaching toward new life Blindly as if aware that out of death may rise Fulfilment to whatever veiled will Created conflict a master soul unknown  Such freedom has no voice it dares not own The abyss the horror of a life made free The grandeur which it cannot understand  Therefore the curtain and the mystery Therefore the silence that is No man s Land  THEY MARCH THROUGH THE STREETS OF PARIS  America Can it be my country that in you The dream men dared not dream is true I know not what the old men seek   Youth steadily tramping eight abreast The Rainbow Division Pershing s Crusaders marching Past the arcades of the Rue de Rivoli They go to defense of unknown Picardy  The black garbed throng and the men in olive drab passing The acclaim and deeper still for those who hear the song Of silent voices rising the birth of a new music in the world Brought by the men of many nations Come from a new home wrought in a new made land  O France again the debt but this debt greater For to us you bring after yourself have bled The will to suffering not in a selfish cause I know not what the old men seek Never to them always to Youth you speak By being France We come youth of America youth dedicate A nation among nations humble before the hope Of freedom proudly to create Our own tradition there in Picardy   Cloyd Head  THE GERMAN EMPIRE BISMARCK VON MOLTKE  Night like a tempest rends the will of earth Braced to a knowledge of the hate ordained Before new brotherhood  Welded by iron a shackled nation taught The consciousness of power without freedom Deformed at birth bidden to strike enslave Forge chain to chain riveting life to darkness  Prussia  We could not know Faith waits its proof confirmed only by blood How deep the source ingenerate the need That seeks its first growth in democracy Not till you struck A hand menacing all that there was yet to gain And all that had been gained  I will not fight against the youth of Germany  Our battle is not won yet will be won Not a defeat of men but of a wrong Can they not hear Youth cries to youth above the clash of war   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The old shall yield before the dream we dream Re find the honor of the Fatherland Help us that there may rise Out of the darkness Peace with victory  EPILOGUE  When all is done The faith unshaken When peace has come The well gained peace When comes that day The living lest they may forget too soon Shall know we fought against the bondage of our souls We fought as one by one So suffered we And found beneath the larger cause our own The unguessed depth and height Under the stars under the sky and night We descried a vision of what things were true  Backward the surge time and the day regain Their mastery Yet something will remain Of vision and the quest the unceasing quest Toward light and toward the spirit that creates Effacing war  Cloyd Head   PARIS 1917  Where is the home of love so dear Where but here yea here Here love and danger snatch the flower Of life perchance a single hour Mate and die Here they lie yea here  Here love hath pierced each heart with grief Joy so brief ah brief Is paid with tears enow They know Our well beloved an utter woe Than death more dread They are wed to grief  None weary of sweet love and dear Nay not here not here Black veiled as any holy nun The brides of love and war are done With love s delight Their long long night is here  In those who give and those who take Hearts must break must break Yet give they of themselves twice o er Who give to love in time of war And lightly bear Despair for dear love s sake  Ruth Gaines   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  THEIR STRANGE EYES HOLD NO VISION  Their strange eyes hold no vision as a rule No dizzy glory A still look is theirs But rather as one subtly vacant stares Watching the circling magic of a pool  Now when the morning firing becomes tame Out in the warming sun he tries to guess Which battery they re after Let me see Which battery is there which battery I wonder which Again again the same Returning question idle meaningless Startled he sighs or laughs or softly swears Mutteringly something of dear names declares In the bitter cruelty of tenderness  The planes drift low circling monotonously Droning like many a drowsy bumble bee Some summer morning Only now and then A whining shell the mere formality Of stupid war calls back his thoughts again  Suddenly near the unseen death swoops low Laughing and singing and full pitifully The startled eyes stare wide but do not see The whirling features of the genie foe Safe in his summoned cloud The quiet skies Tell not his surest comings With waved wands Howard Buck  A mist springs from the earth and swaying stands A veiling moment sinks And there he lies Face down clutching the clay with warm dead hands  Howard Buck   LITANY  Saint Genevieve whose sleepless watch Saved threatened France of old Above the ship that carries him Your sacred vigil hold  Where all the fair green fields you loved Are scarred with bursting shell Joan the Maid who fought for France Oh guard your young knight well  But if by sea or if by land God set death in his way Then Mother of the Sacrificed Teach me what prayer to pray  Aliene Gregory   FLOWERS OF WAR  THE LILIES OF FRANCE  J F S J  France s lilies are tall and white Brave as the dawn calm as the night And fragrantly they sway above The quiet head of one I love  Unceasingly these fadeless flowers Hasten their bloom through the war swept hours And many a lad shall have their foam Washing with peace his new found home  O France s lilies are tall with pride Flooding the slopes of the western side It comforts me they sway above The quiet head of one I love  KNOW THYSELF  I shall not grudge the falling if I may have the fight  For the soul of man is comfortless unless he prove his might  Rather my body fall today unnoticed and unsought  Than I should hail tomorrow s dawn with any fight unfought   Louise Ayres Garnett  COMRADES  Last night I dreamed the Cross of God Stood rooted deep in Flanders sod And wide its open arms were spread Over the fields of living dead Mile upon mile the crosses rose Shepherding sleep s supreme repose And as I looked they seemed to be Merged into conquering Calvary O Jesus more than Savior now Brother soldier captain Thou Each of Thy comrades of the cross Treasures the gift that man calls loss Oh what an Easter lies concealed Beneath the flowers on Flanders Field  Louise Ayres Garnett  HONORS  France counts not blasted trees among her losses  Nor flowers torn from the valley or hill crest  For in their stead are rows on rows of crosses  The which she wears more proudly on her breast Antoinette De Coursey Patterson   THE HOPE  The hope I hold The leering demon days Deride and reason plays Snug as a raven on a gallows tree Its ancient game with me Flapping its wings and lewdly gibbering Life is a humorous thing But on I fare clutching it is not gold The hope I hold  The hope I hold Delicate cruelty Snatches at passing by And like a vine leaf fallen from its place Upon a tortured face Offers its fragrance to betray sighs low Life is a humorous show But on I fare clutching It is not gold The hope I hold  The hope I hold Nature herself with glee Derides And destiny With evil goblin laughter indicates   John Cowper Powys  The adamantine gates And with a maniac chuckle rallies me That way is closed you see But I fare on clutching It is not gold The hope I hold  O hope whose face in madness I have kissed O hope that art a miraage and a mist Shall I destroy thee now and laugh thereat It is too late for that  John Cowper Powys  THE KIND HEART  Though I go out in cold and storm My heart shall keep my body warm Though I am humble though I am poor The rich are begging at my door I am the least a man may be But the great come and kneel to me  Julia Wickham Greenwood   THRONES  Golden and green and blue  Is the screen of the Empress throne  Golden and green and blue  And the black of ebony  Green and blue are the peacocks plumes  Standing to right and left  Golden and blue and green the silk  Of the high swung canopy  Wide and deep is the Empress throne  Of carven ebony  With its straight footstool  And its peacocks fans  And its shadowing mystery  Brown is the slope of the dust blown hill And brown the dust blown plain Grey are the guarding dogs of stone And grey the sentinels  Grey are the carven shapes that lead  To a carven sepulchre  Grey is the broken balustrade  And grey the heavy walls  Wide and deep is the Empress throne  On that hillside far away  With its carven dogs   Mary Aldis  And its sentinels  And its mighty door of grey  O BITTER DAY  O pale small face I saw a moment in a throng of men I am bereft I am alone  I seek but nowhere find again Your startled grace O pale small face  O fearful heart Forever questioning forever dumb I weary af your sick mistrust  Why do you bolt the door when love would come Go dwell apart O fearful heart  O bitter day When you looked and passed you of the pale small face You of the sweet tormented eyes  The eager tread the startled grace Yet I said no word to make you stay O bitter bitter day  EMBARCATION  Slowly the great wave of a nation s sorrow Rises and swells and surges   From unseen depths it comes From very far away Silently relentlessly it moves Forward forward forward Until at last with a profound reverberation It breaks upon the grey inevitable rock And falls back broken into fragments That seethe in restless foam  GO FROM ME  O Pain go from me for a little space Leave me to greet the sun awakened day You have companioned me in every place Now for an hour I would go my way  I would go forth with lifted eyes and heart Hearing the blackbird s cry the lark s delight The whole world sings I must attune my part Send my voice ringing down the halls of night  I have been patient with your dull dead clasp Have borne the horror of your fierce embrace I have not shrunk from your unceasing grasp Nor from the lowering pallor of your face  Now I am weary I would go my way  One hour alone to greet the new born day  Mary Aldis   THE TRENCHES  The night fall in the trenches The hungry Russian plain Stretching its endless whiteness  Beneath the bullet s rain Those flecks of black and crimson Ah God the vultures know Are hearts that beat with love and hope But one short hour ago  Above the fumes of battle Above the shrieks of hell The singing of the bullet The crashing of the shell A dream of gold green shadows Ah God the wood doves know Where you and I walked hand in hand A thousand years ago  A Alondra   REDHAW WINDS  FALLTIME  Gold of a ripe oat straw gold of a southwest moon Canada thistle blue and flimmering larkspur blue Tomatoes shining in the October sun with red hearts Shining five and six in a row on a wooden fence Why do you keep wishes shining on your faces all day long Wishes like women with half forgotten lovers going to  new cities  What is there for you in the birds the birds the birds crying down on the north wind in September acres of birds spotting the air going south  Is there something finished And some new beginning on the way  AUTUMN MOVEMENT  I cried over beautiful things knowing no beautiful thing lasts  The field of cornflower yellow is a scarf at the neck of the copper sunburned woman the mother of the year the taker of seeds  The northwest wind comes and the yellow is torn full of holes new beautiful things come in the first spit of snow on the northwest wind and the old things go not one lasts   Carl Sandburg  VALLEY SONG  Your eyes and the valley are memories Your eyes fire and the valley a bowl It was here a moonrise crept over the timberline It was here we turned the coffee cups upside down And your eyes and the moon swept the valley  I will see you again in a million years I will see you again to morrow I will never know your dark eyes again These are three ghosts I keep These are three sumach red dogs I run with  All of it wraps and knots to a riddle I have the moon the timberline and you All three are gone and I keep all three  OLD FASHIONED REQUITED LOVE  I have ransacked the encyclopedias And slid my fingers among topics and titles Looking for you  And the answer comes slow There seems to be no answer  I shall ask the next banana peddler the who and why of it  Or the iceman with his iron tongs gripping a clear cube in summer sunlight maybe he will know   THE NEXT CHILD WAITS  I know the city waits the next child waits there is a great singing Mother  Our earth of a turning ball who set it swinging A great Nobody Who put the People down on the wire grass wilderness A great Nobody  I have listened to the tides of the sea trying to spell the word I have walked under tall trees and heard winter winds trying to write the high sign of it I have felt the magnet pull of it under the shoes of my feet in the dirt of a prairie road  I know the city waits the next child waits there is a great singing Mother  ASSYRIAN TABLETS From the Fourth Millennium B C Free translation  ASHURNATSIRPAL THE THIRD  Three walls around the town of Tela when I came They expected everything of those walls nobody in the town came out to kiss my feet  I knocked the walls down killed three thousand soldiers Took away cattle and sheep took all the loot in sight And burned special captives   Carl Sandburg  Some of the soldiers I cut off hands and feet Others I cut off nose ears fingers Some I put out the eyes I made a pyramid of heads I strung heads on trees circling the town  When I got through with it There wasn t much left of the town of Tela  BILBEA  Shamash If he knows copper hair And blood flower lips Shamash watches you For my sake  Bilbea I was in Babylon on Saturday night I saw nothing of you anywhere I was at the old place and the other girls were there But no Bilbea  Have you gone to another house or city Why don t you write I was sorry I walked home half sick  Tell me how it goes Send me some kind of a letter And take care of yourself  Carl Sandburg   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  CHROMATICS  TH E SONG  That day in the slipping of torsos and straining flanks On the bloodied ooze of fields plowed by iron And the smoke bluish near earth and gold in the sunshine Floating like cotton down Do you remember how we heard All the Red Cross bands on Fifth Avenue And bugles in little home towns And children s harmonicas bleating AMERICA And the harsh and terrible screaming And that strange vibration at the roots of us Desire fierce like a song  And after Do you remember the drollery of the wind on our faces And horizons reeling And the terror of the plain heaving like a gaunt pelvis to  the sun Over us threshing and twanging Torn up roots of the song  IRON WINE  The ore in the crucible is pungent smelling like acrid wine It is dusky red like the ebb of poppies   Lola Ridge  And purple like the blood of elderberries Surely it is a strong wine juice distilled of the fierce iron  I am drunk of its fumes I feel its fiery flux  Diffusing permeating Working some strange alchemy   So that I turn aside from the goodly board So that I look askance upon the common cup And from the mouths of crucibles  Suck forth the acrid sap  TH E FIDDLER  In a little Hungarian café  Men and women are drinking Yellow wine in tall goblets  Through the milky haze of the smoke  The fiddler undersized blond  Leans to his violin  As to the breast of a woman  Red hair kindles to fire  On the black of his coat sleeve Where his white thin hand  Trembles and dives Like a sliver of moonlight When wind has broken the water   DAWN WIND  Wind just arisen Off what cool matters of marsh moss In tented boughs leaf drawn before the stars Or niche of cliff under the eagles You of living things So gay and tender and full of play Why do you blow on my thoughts like cut flowers Gathered and laid to dry on this paper rolled out of dead  wood  I see you Shaking that flower at me with soft invitation And frisking away Deliciously rumpling the grass   So you fluttered the curtains about my cradle Prattling of fields Before I had had my milk Did I stir on my pillow making to follow you Fleet One I swaddled unwinged like a bird in the egg  Let be My dreams that crackle under your breath You have the dust of the world to blow on  Do not tag me and dance away looking back I am too old to play with you Eternal child   Lola Ridge  TH E EDGE  I  I thought to die that night in the solitude  where they would never find me But there was time And I lay quietly on the drawn knees of the mountain  staring into the abyss  I do not know how long I could not count the hours they ran so fast Like little bare foot urchins shaking my hands away But I remember Somewhere water trickled like a thin severed vein And a wind came out of the grass Touching me gently tentatively like a paw  As the night grew The gray cloud that had covered the sky like sackcloth Fell in ashen folds about the hills Like hooded virgins pulling their cloaks about them There must have been a spent moon For the tall one s veil held a shimmer of silver   This too I remember And the tenderly rocking mountain Silence And beating stars    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  II  Dawn Lay like a waxen hand upon the world And folded hills Broke into a solemn wonder of peaks stemming clear and  cold Till the Tall One bloomed like a lily Flecked with sun Fine as a golden pollen It seemed a wind might blow it from the snow  I smelled the raw sweet essences of things And heard spiders in the leaves And ticking of little feet As tiny creatures came out of their doors To see God pouring light into his star  It seemed life held No future and no past for me but this  And I too got up stiffly from the earth And held my heart up like a cup  Lola Ridge  COMMENT  JOYCE KILMER  OETRY S sixth birthday finds the nations still at war and the United States pouring her armies into the battle fields of France But the day is brighter than for four tragic years the German hordes are beginning the backward sweep which will not end we may reasonably hope until the blood soaked borders of France Belgium and Italy are delivered from the invader until dare we hope so far until the Balkan states are set in order until heroic Serbia is restored until even chaotic Russia is offered peace to bind up her wounds and even the German people achieve their freedom  Our American poets are doing their share in this battle of two epochs doing it not only with songs their own weapon but with guns and grenades as well We have all read their songs of war and some of these the future will read But for their more active labors in the great conflict we must count the stars in their service flag  Two gold stars shine at the top of the flag which hangs in the poets window one for Alan Seeger American volunteer in the Foreign Legion who died in France July the fourth 1916 after nearly two years of service and now another for Joyce Kilmer who was killed in action at the Picardy front on August the first Both these poets were young though not in their first youth Seeger the student and rover guest of France and her lover entered her serv   ice when the enemy set foot upon her soil and died for her at twenty eight Kilmer who had just passed thirty volunteered when his country entered the war although his responsibilities as a husband and the father of four children would have exempted him from military obligation He was sent to France last year and was a sergeant at the time of his death  Death in battle is for a poet an accolade it ennobles him gives him a high significance At once his songs assume a richer color from the beauty of his devotion and the people in whose service he died cherish them like jewels These two young American poets dying gallantly in a great war achieve undying fame and lift the best of their songs toward the sun as if at the tip of a flag in the van of armies No American can easily forget Seeger s Rendezvous with Death and now Joyce Kilmer s Trees his rhapsodic octave Poets and the more recent Prayer of a Soldier in France will also flash with glory in the eyes of his fellow countrymen  Our acquaintance with Joyce Kilmer began with Trees which POETRY had the honor of publishing toward the end of its first year in August 1913 The delicate quatrain Easter followed the next April and an essay on the poetry of Gerard Hopkins in September In March 1917 came The Blue Valentine that lovely tribute to Aline and The Thorn a tribute to the holy warrior Saint Michael who has nobly answered his devotee s prayer  The Ivory Tower is fair to see And may her walls encompass me   Joyce Kilmer  But when the Devil comes with the thunder of his might Saint Michael show me how to fight  The poet had a singularly gracious and loyal character and unusual personal charm He was as everyone knows an enthusiastic convert to Roman Catholicism and his best poems are enriched with deep religious devotion The rapturous worship of the grandeur of God which he praised in Gerard Hopkins may be found in certain of his own poems eloquently in Memorial Day The Rosary and the sonnet so self prophetic In Memory of Rupert Brooke more loftily in The Fourth Shepherd Poets and the more recent Prayer We quote today in his honor two of these poems chosen partly because they are less familiar than the lovely Trees but chiefly because his religion was so profoundly the central motive of his life and thought and moreover good devotional poetry is of all kinds the rarest nowadays and these are aflame with the real fire The first poem is from a recent number of Good Housekeeping the second from Trees and Other Poems George  H Doran Co 1914  PRAYER OF A SOLDIER IN FRANCE  My shoulders ache beneath my pack  Lie easier Cross upon His back I march with feet that burn and smart Tread Holy Feet upon my heart  Men shout at me who may not speak They scourged Thy back and smote Thy cheek I may not lift a hand to clear  My eyes of salty drops that sear   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Then shall ray fickle soul forget Thy Agony of Bloody Sweat  My rifle hand is stiff and numb From Thy pierced palm red rivers come  Lord Thou didst suffer more for me Than all the hosts of land and sea  So let me render back again This millionth of Thy gift Amen  POETS  Vain is the chiming of forgotten bells That the wind sways above a ruined shrine Vainer his voice in whom no longer dwells Hunger that craves immortal Bread and Wine  Light songs we breathe that perish with our breath Out of our lips that have not kissed the rod They shall not live who have not tasted death They only sing who are struck dumb by God  It may be that this latter poem is his finest utterance  finest because of all his songs so few and brief it burns  with the whitest heat of rapture It is worthy to be carved upon his tomb H M  THE OTHER STARS IN THE POETS FLAG  One after another our poets are sailing for France or at least are in camp preparing to sail Arthur Davison Ficke erstwhile a lawyer in Davenport is now a major in the Ordnance Reserve Corps stationed at last accounts in Paris William Rose Benêt is a lieutenant in the Aviation   The Other Stars in the Poets Flag  Section of the Signal Reserve Corps and Kendall Banning is a major in

shoulder straps the list is quite long H Thompson Rich formerly editor of The Forum is an acting sergeant of the Medical Corps perhaps already transferred to the School of Military Psychology at Camp Greenleaf Georgia training in which he hopes may win him a commission Archie Austin Coates of New York who has also been a magazine editor has be come Chief Yeoman in the U S Naval Reserve being on duty in publicity work at the Brooklyn Navy Yard Francis Buzzell of Chicago author of poems and short stories is likewise in the navy being detailed to the congenial duty of editing the Great Lakes Recruit  A number are in various departments of the medical and ambulance service Cloyd Head and Willard Wattles on this side John Black and Robert Redfield Jr on the other though the latter has been invalided home Dr Frank S   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Gordon was rejected for this service because of two pounds underweight  Baker Brownell Louis Gilmore Earl B Marlatt Mark Turbyfill John Pierre Roche and Morris Gilbert are in different camps or perhaps on their way to the front Salomon de la Selva the Nicaraguan poet being refused by Uncle Sam sailed last month for England having succeeded in enrolling himself in the British army John Mc Clure wrote last spring of soon going into training and Dean B Lyman Jr was to enlist last summer  J E Scruggs of Atlanta wrote us when on the point of going to camp I passed up my chance of being an officer because I wanted to feel the thrill of being a private a conscripted private and he has now achieved his desire in the 52nd Infantry John B Weaver of Chicago is impatient of ordnance training longs to get over and be a real part in this wonderful affair certainly if I survive the experience it will have been the most valuable thing that could have come into my life And Paul B Sifton of Montana wrote from France a year ago  At the time of taking the soldiers oath I thought to gain color for future writings Now that I am here close to the quivering wide gaping wound of War I have put the thought from me for a time at least perhaps for good if my life is necessary in the caging of the imperialists If I come out pathos hate lust abnegation I shall have known them all  Others are in the Red Cross or the Y M C A or in work for college men in the army William Griffith Lee Wilson Dodd Raymond P Holden perhaps more Nor must we forget the women at least two of whom Miss   The Other Stars in the Poets Flag  Gladys Cromwell of New York and Miss Eloise Robinson of Cincinnati are doing canteen work in France  Of course there are soldiers also among POETRY S British contributors Rupert Brooke and Edward Thomas head the list having given the last proof of devotion Ford Madox Hueffer and Richard Aldington have been at the front two or three years also Frederic Manning and Isaac Rosenberg all of whom have sent us war poems A few months ago F S Flint was accepted and sent to Flanders and Wilfrid Wilson Gibson after three rejections succeeded in getting into the ranks  For all these and any other poets who may take their share of the hazardous adventure let us who write and read this record wish high service to the cause we are fighting for and a safe return when victory is won  H M  AESTHETIC AND SOCIAL CRITICISM  Mr Bourne and Mr Brooks were so polite in their letter to the editors in our September number that exceptions to their points seem almost a discourtesy We are appalled at the danger of losing our equilibrium and being once more accused of rushing jealously and angrily to the defense of our contributors at the sign of any fancied slight Dear readers were we angry or jealous and did we merely fancy a slight in Mr Bourne s slur upon the vogue of the little theatres and little magazines And   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  did we defend or even mention a single contributor in our effort to show Mr Bourne that those Traps for the Unwary which bother him so much are not formidable  He now explains that in appealing for more careful and better oriented criticism he did the new poetry and the little magazines the honor of assuming that they had arrived Well we never dreamed that anyone could doubt our arrival and were in no fear of being destroyed by a rude touch What we objected to was the rudeness of the touch its way of putting us in our place as a critical journal among the un careful and un orienting Again dear readers we will leave it to you whether POETRY has treated the art as shut up in its own world or as an expression of life pregnant with possibilities Perhaps Mr Bourne has not been one of your select company  As for that developing orthodoxy of the new where have these two gentlemen found it in POETRY whose critical articles have covered a wide range of opinion from Ezra Pound to Louis Untermeyer By way of illustrating that better and more oriented criticism they solemnly inform us that there is no way for instance of knowing yet where Mr Lindsay will come out and ask who in the little circle of poetry missionaries points out to him the dangers of mere verbality and the imperative need of growth Well ask Mr Lindsay who has been his sternest censor against verbality and other dangers As to the imperative need of growth probably he requires no information on that rather obvious and universal need   Aesthetic and Social Criticism  But these are trifles let us pass on to the main point of our correspondents argument their complaint that this public the new poetry s public enthusiastic and hospitable seems to be still moving hazily in a mist of values and interpretations for it still gets aesthetic instead of social criticism The phrase tempts one toward a subject much befogged by careless thinking and still more careless writing that of the poet s or more comprehensively the artist s business The subject is ancient but undying and if our inquiry becomes platitudinous it will not be the first time nor yet the last that such questions have run up against the obvious  The artist is born to express the beauty of life The first essential in this his business is that he should feel this beauty feel it perhaps more keenly more profoundly than his fellow creatures the second that he should be able to express his feeling Now the beauty of life is a large subject embracing not only the people now on earth with their social frame work their natural environment of land water air and their spiritual equipment of emotion and desire all set in the midst of a solar system and a sidereal universe and other infinities of creative passion embracing not only all this but also infinities past and future material and spiritual mysteries which stagger the imagination Each artist being like the rest of us incapable of infinity feels and expresses that special beauty which is most immediate to his consciousness He has an inalienable right to his specialty as good a right as the honey bee or the brick   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  layer and the critic s function is to demand of him not  some other specialty but sincerity and achievement in the  one which has chosen him  These generalities lead to the question what Mr Brooks and Mr Bourne mean by social criticism in the arts An artist may find his special beauty in the social movements of our time in strikes or war or pacifism or settlements or the Bolsheviki but has the critic any right to complain if he finds it like Whistler in the fall of a rocket or the turn of a girl s figure or like Inness in a sunset drift of autumnal colors Of the lyric or the landscape painter and to the same degree of the lyric or the landscape poet say Orrick Johns and John Gould Fletcher the critic has a right to measure the degree of success in expressing the  vision that is he has a right to aesthetic criticism But were he to indulge in social criticism were he to rebuke let us say George Inness for not painting Lincoln or H D for not singing the battle of the Marne he would be uttering the too common kind of banalities which make the public still move hazily in a mist of values  The artist of course can express only himself If his vision is limited by the drawing room his utmost achievement will be a delicate miniature or a finely turned vers de société If his vision embraces the mediaeval world and its religion his achievement will be a Divina Commedia The critic may rank the artist and define his work but it is easier by thinking to find out God than by criticizing to change a poet s scope and product The critic may legiti   Aesthetic and Social Criticism  mately indulge in discussion of a larger scope examine the art in relation to the larger movement of ideas and social movements and the peculiar intellectual and spiritual color of the time but his discussion if it is just will have to estimate values at last by the strictly aesthetic standard The poem or picture will stand by its aesthetic adequacy in the triumphant expression of the vision in the artist s soul whether this vision be minute or cosmic And if it is aesthetically inadequate the most illuminating social wisdom will not save it  But social critcism in the arts is probably more befogging to the critic and his public than to the artist The artist big or little is in his degree a seer and it may be that he sees deeper than the Critic who is obsessed by the movements of the time It may be that Verlaine s prison song or a single drawing of a nude or a tree by Arthur Davies have more importance in the eternal scheme of beauty and are more interpretive of their age than the most shapely revelation of contemporary movements Movements pass but beauty endures Our age will endure in the beauty it creates and in that beauty its essential movement will be expressed It may be as indeed I believe that certain of our living poets will be remembered in that ultimate record but if they fail it will be through lack of power to feel or to express or both and not through lack of social criticism H M   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  REVIEWS  WILD SWANS  The Wild Swans at Coole Other Verses and a Play in  Verse by W B Yeats The Cuala Press Dundrum  Ireland  For a poet with such a personality as Yeats it seems almost indecorous to bare it before us in the midst of our social political and literary lives Yeats makes poetry out of the fact that he is a proud sensitive cultivated Irishman He hardly has to make poetry except the rhymes which don t matter he just lets his heart talk as in the poems about the dying lady  In a despondent mood the poet like some of the admirers of his earlier manner longs for the leopards of the moon and complains of the harsh and timid sun Whatever the lights are of Ego Dominus Tuus Presences Men Improve With Years The Collarbone of a Hare The Fisherman The Hawk they shine The invading hawk too if not indecorous is unfair as unfair as some similarly naive passages in the Bible are  What tumbling cloud did you cleave Yellow eyed hawk of the mind Last evening that I who had sat Dumbfounded before a knave Should give to my friend A pretence of wit  The weighing and measuring the critical care evidently spent on this thin volume save the reviewer most of his labor If the longer poems seem to him in spite of their   Wild Swans  shrewdness and spells of passion somewhat old fashioned he is willing to bend to the opinion of the author of the others One can not but pay reverence to a poet who after having written poetry for many years can still be read with the same critical alertness that one would give to the best of the younger poets And if there is a drooping line here and there the author is too proud too able and too conscientious to arouse misgivings that he will ever bank on his reputation  Here is Yeats in a very gentle mood  PRESENCES  This night has been so strange that it seemed  As if the hair stood up on my head  From going down of the sun I have dreamed  That women laughing or timid or wild  In rustle of lace or silken stuff  Climbed up my creaking stair They had read  All I had rhymed of that monstrous thing  Returned and yet unrequited love  They stood in the door and stood between  My great wood lecturn and the fire  Till I could hear their hearts beating  One is a harlot and one a child  That never looked upon man with desire  And one it may be a queen  In Ego Dominus Tuus the beautiful poetic dialogue which appeared first in POETRY and is reprinted here and in his latest prose volume the poet would have us believe  that great poems are the result of the poet s opposite image an expression of what the poet is not I think this opposite and not his little every day thoughts and actions is the poet Dowson s drunkenness and Dante s lecherous   life are somewhat beside the mark as their effects on the poet s soul are mainly those of health and sickness They are ethical and civil sins but hardly poetic sins Their scars on the poet are not of the same character as Turner s miserliness or as malice envy etc But even these when present are hardly more than masks of the poet s soul perhaps hardly more than masks of any soul it is in his poems that the real soul can be seen Nor is indulgence due as Yeats thinks to the poet s desire to escape from himself but rather in so far as it is more than mere exhaustion due to his desire to find himself It is the disappointment with pleasure and life s egging on  At the Hawk s Well beautiful as it is as poetry and as a poetic play does not to me seem to be a Noh play in the full sense of the term The Noh play is based on something nearer to the lives of the Japanese people than a legend A modern Noh play to have a similar appeal would have to be based on something nearer the lives of the Irish people A play based on Davitt or Parnell might come nearer the Japanese or perhaps best a play based on something in modern life treated mystically But it has the great merit of being the first attempt at a Noh play in English  M M  A RHAPSODIST  Children of the Sun Rhapsodies and Poems by Wallace  Gould Cornhill Press Boston  This book arouses widely different feelings and opinions a sign of vitality Recently Mr Marsden Hartley re   A Rhapsodist  proached me for neglecting it so I opened the copy on our  shelves and found to my regret that I had never actually  read it I had merely given it a glance and postponed the  reading being antagonized by pages like this strung out  without a single kindly comma  Then I grasped the silver bowl Around an handle of the bowl coiled the viper gaping hissing and the viper hissed unheard for the music shrieked and wailed and groaned and trilled and rumbled and crashed and throbbed and throbbed and throbbed and became a din and again I gasped and paused and laughed  Returning repentantly to the book I found that a number of poets looking it over had obeyed the office rule to record their first very casual impressions Carl Sandburg wrote A vast sincerity here a beating of wings Another poet even better known wrote Mind wanderings A third  Max Michelson was more detailed saying  Amateurish Indian legend poor Longfellowish Second rhapsody best but hardly more than material and cat pieces near the end Out of season has good plot though not new and in places shows courageous understanding but on the whole it is outrageous sentimentalism his sympathy for the cripple is bad as art and bad as truth the murder in the end and much of the rest is absolutely meaningless But the book carries the reader shows possibilities glimpses Here and there something is brooding not brought out   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  And then there is Mr Hartley s opinion one not to be  disregarded because the poet is his friend since friendship  sharpens oftener than it dulls the critical faculty I quote  fragments from his letter  Wallace Gould is the first distinctive poet of Maine the first to express that state and his voice is as authentic as the life of the place itself I can think of no one who is so engrossed with the idea of the elimination of personal interpretation He spends most of his time pruning to the very last and as he has scarcely ever been out of that state his writings have the ring of absolute character As I was also born in Maine I know just how actual they are in their import as well as in treatment He has a  striding terrific imagination Kreymborg likes his work very much also Sherwood Anderson Waldo Frank and others who have seen it privately He is a dramatic figure in the American literary world and one day his story will be a telling one  So I began at the beginning and swung along with the poet to the end I forgot perhaps with some difficulty his typographical mannerisms and tried to attune my ear and feeling to the rhythmic effects he intends by his triple repetitions of two word lines and other rather empirical phrasings and line divisions  Well I can t say that I get Maine from this book or any special locale even when the subjects are most specifically from Maine The poet seems to me in his degree essentially spiritual and remote from any locale Ab Uno Disce Omnes for example has a certain spectral quality an intensity of spiritual solitude Its rush of repeated short lines alternated with passages of reverberating long ones has a strong cumulative effect for which the analogies are closer probably in music Mr Gould is also a musician than in poetry I don t feel that this cumulative effect works   A Rhapsodist  up in this long poem to a sufficient and justifying climax The end trails off too much like the rest of it The poet hasn t achieved the final stroke it seems to me pounded in the last nail  In form this poem is a brilliant étude in strongly marked and resolutely contrasted rhythms probably the most brilliant in the book I don t think Mr Gould s rhythms are subtle any more than his choice and grouping of the words which their movement carries But they are large sweeping powerful they sink their craft to a whisper and lift it to a resonant shout and bring it to port with a possibly too obvious ease This danger of obviousness is perhaps most evident in The Legend which opens the book whose alternations of blank verse with repetitive phrase rhythms if not quite Longfellowish are far less interpretive of the Indian in every way more traditional and less profound less grown up than Dr Gordon s Sa a Narai and The Tom tom Miss Skinner s Songs of the Coast dwellers or certain Chippewa poems by Mr Lew Sarett which POETRY will have the honor of presenting to its readers next month The comparison may not be quite fair because Mr Gould is telling a story about the Indian while the others are uttering the Indian s own song but the fact remains that from the aboriginal hint he draws merely a pretty story and though he tells it with dramatic effectiveness in resonant rolling chords of sound he does not impress upon it any very special original tang  Out of Season the story of the armless man and the friend   whose life he saved and whom he finally murders seems to me melodrama the least convincing section of the book and the most labored in its motive and its rhythmic treatment It may be one of those dark spots of Maine which Mr Hartley thinks his friend is revealing but I must give it up and pass on to the final section of the book the fifty or more short poems called Others Nameless  Here there is more of Maine Also the poems being shorter and more within the range of common experience I can perhaps quote a few and let the poet persuade our readers so far as he is able I shall not venture to change his typography much as I should like to We have a picture of Augusta city of dignity city of old mansions and of the Kennebec famous lovely sensuous immense a bit indolent  I know the dreams of the Kennebec  For the forms of my fathers appear in those dreams  The poet pictures his wonderful garden where everything runs wild and lists its flowers but  Today these things all drip with sounding unceasing rain  The leaves are all twitching pelted with big drops  Yes everything runs wild  For everything I love I leave alone  Then he gets further out into the open hears the bobolink free to sing and go and feels the wind  the sensual humming fitful wind as fitful constant and strong as  the wind of the sea humming like the wind of the sea and sensual as the wind of the sea though smelling of apple blossoms   A Rhapsodist  and all the new things drenched with days of rain and steaming  beneath a triumphant sun steaming and glowing at hand and afar for miles and miles hills of glowing green swamps of glowing green  all swept by the wind so like the wind of the sea the uncomrnanded wind  The poems become more personal and reminiscent lovesongs summer beach descriptions songs of  my sad old mother hid in her chamber silently weeping the last of her sorrows the sorrow of absence  And he enters the house with its dark sweet rooms its  furniture dark and some of it old  My mother myself and my cat are happy there but only when I am there  We have a description of the garden made weird by  moonlight  Last night I went alone and lingered in my old wild garden where there were scarlet poppy women passionate who scorned the moon s mock potency where there were blue closed cornflowers who waited for their chosen lord in chastity where there were columbines who made a cuckold of the sun  accepting dew jewels from the moon where there were many weeds and the winds which came from the somewheres of the south stirred the odors of mint and of roses and of heliotrope and were hot and the moon was crossed by a smear of vapor yellow and thin and was as teasing as a nipple protruding through lace  The poet celebrates swimming by moonlight describes the shimmering pearls and purples of winter loves the rain for its thousands of sounds and its liveliness in cutting the air tells of the summer people gibbering foolishly along the wharf gives a story of Madame singing with a note like a summer moon lolling on an ebbing tide gloats over his pied cat with white feet twinkling like stars And he has a poem about an old woman which seems to me one of the best in the book and one of the most characteristic Here it is all but the last few lines for like many another poet Mr Gould has a way of going on after his poem is finished  She was an old free woman forsaken She walked along the highroad humming looking below upon the  Sabbath sleepy city which glimmered in the westward light of  an afternoon of September and she saw that the world had collapsed and she looked upon the ruins of the world and they were yellow and white and brown and she turned from the highroad into a logging road and began to wander and began to murmur and she murmured in a kind of song scattering white plumed seeds as she wandered  There is peace in the woods this afternoon dear There is peace in the woods this afternoon my child Tis quieted Tis easier to die  Where are you now dear Where are you now my child   A Rhapsodist  Child I am alone Child I am wandering alone alone where the weeds and vines are broken down and entangled and tarnished Child I am weeping Child I am growing old Oh the dead weeds rasp and the dead vines rattle and I love you Child I love you Child I am growing old There is as Carl Sandburg says a vast sincerity here a beating of wings If only the wings would oftener carry one somewhere if only their beating were not so often a mere ineffectual repetition of phrases and sounds Mr Gould would register more strongly his proud soaring spirit and his powerful baritone voice As the book stands it is a mixture of the prosaic the banal the grandiose the sprawling with a true poetic strain a poetic quality of imagination expressed at its best in a chanting rhythm of strong cumulative power The poems lack architectural structure they spread all over the ground instead of concentrating they trail off instead of shaping to a climax But there is a spirit in them which if it is only capable of self discipline is on the way to achieve a rich and exuberant beauty  H M   LEWISOHN ON FRENCH POETS  The Poets of Modern France by Ludwig Lewisohn B W  Huebsch  This book will be of great value to those who are eager to know more about the various movements in modern French poetry There are few competent studies of this subject in English and Mr Lewisohn ranges over a wider field than Miss Lowell aimed at in her Six French Poets He gives us an interesting introduction dealing with the struggle of man toward self hood in art saying  The pang of beauty the exaltation in truth the vision of the tragedy of life arise in the fullest sense only when the individual liberates himself from the tribe and faces the universe alone  And in speaking of the poet as that individual he tells us that the very splendor of traditional associations the throb of a thousand voices paralyze him that he is like a stripling running à race in the brocades of an ancient king  We learn to distinguish the forerunners of Symbolism The author analyzes the Parnassien Leconte de Lisle and the modified Parnassien Charles Baudelaire and discusses Gustave Kahn Paul Verlaine and the acknowledged founder of Symbolism Stéphane Mallarmé He traces with rare insight the reaction for a long time so little understood which brought out Emile Verhaeren and Henri de Régnier afterwards Jean Moréas and the two Americans Francis Vielé Griffin and Stuart Merrill a little later Albert Samain and Remy de Gourmont and finally the younger poets who trail its ideals into the present time Of the latter are Paul Fort who acknowledges his debt to Moréas Fran   Lewisohn on French Poets  cis Jammes Pierre Louys whom the author calls a NeoParnassien Edmond Rostand a descendant of Lamartine and Hugo and others The youngest group of all André Spire Charles Vildrac Georges Duhamel etc have dropped tradition completely he tells us and are cultivating free verse He explains that practically all of the poets of modern France he names exceptions have hitherto withdrawn into houses of revery and his plea is for an awakening to more rugged realities in the French poetry to come  After reading what Mr Lewisohn has to say in his excellent preface relative to the translating of poetry I hoped to find in his own interpretations of this dusk and dawn of the mind a fine exception to the general rule But the old pitfalls are apparent even in his illuminating work though he has succeeded with many poems which have been failures in other hands He has caught the spirit of Verhaeren especially in The Mill which is exceedingly well done One might rather say that he like Verhaeren has caught the spirit of the mill But in some of the renderings there is an obvious effort to get around a word an expression as in his version of that lovely thing by Moréas A Young Girl Speaks Apparition one of the better known of Mallarmé s poems one may never say popular in speaking of his work and one of the most difficult to fit into English has been faithfully worked out I think I have never read a more literal translation word for word line for line being amazingly there not however the fresh   music of the original And lovers of Verlaine will hardly  be satisfied with  O you who stand here full of tears That flow and flow What have you done with the lost years Of long ago  as an attempt to voice as pure a lyricism as was ever  uttered that piercing heart cry  Qu as tu fait ô toi que voilà Pleurant sans cesse Dis qu as tu fait toi que voilà De ta jeunesse  But the charm of Verlaine s thought is perhaps more than that of any other French poet dependent for its most subtle expression upon the medium of his own language  One wonders why Maeterlinck should be represented by two of his poorest poems when the author might have enriched this collection by choosing two of his best The same may be said of Fernand Gregh s Doubt Why have included this when there was at hand lavish material for beauty Gregh is a member of the Academy and one of the striking figures in French poetry to day His Maison de l Enfance is a masterpiece and others of his poems are important and beautiful There are poems by Francis Jammes Paul Fort s lyric of the dead girl and his Images of Our Dreams the latter as in the original in rhyme but printed as prose Verlaine s Song Without Words is very lovely in its English setting and I wish I had the space to quote from some of these distinguished lyrics which have stood the test of translating   Lewisohn on French Poets  Th e sketches of the thirty poets give this book an imperative claim to be on every book shelf If you would find out the titles of all the books a French poet who has appealed to you has written if you would learn something definite about another of whom you have heard only vaguely Mr Lewisohn s carefully prepared biographies and bibliography are admirably at your service Agnes Lee Freer CORRESPONDENCE  LETTERS FROM FRANCE  W e cannot forbear quoting for the benefit of our readers portions of recent letters from poets at the front Th e first is from Miss Eloise Robinson who is on active service in the canteen work of the Y M C A She writes under date of August 5th  I wish I might tell you of my visit to the French front and how for two nights I slept in a cave with seven Frenchmen and had a hundred bombs dropped on top of me Not directly on top of course The nearest hit just in front of the house And for five days and nights after that I was taking chocolate to advance batteries to men who can never leave their guns even to come to the Foyer du Soldat The Foyer was only a dug out and the air was so thick with flies and smoke that it looked like jam Every morning when I got up I literally had to pry myself out of the mud of course there were no beds And at that I wanted to stay There is a great satisfaction about actually doing something with your hands for these men But I was long overdue in Paris because we were not able to get through the barrage the drive had just started Aren t our boys doing wonderful things At a cost though  I leave tonight for the Swiss border And after that Italy and then the Polish American front It is all one mad scramble but wonderful simply wonderful I cannot be too thankful I was able to come   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  In an earlier letter July 23rd Miss Robinson tells a  story  Apropos of just nothing at all unless it be that I am a little homesick for the last Poetry which hasn t reached me yet I extracted a story from Miss Mary Lawton who is ever here as one of the Y M C A entertainers  She bad given a reading before some of the soldiers and they were buzzing around her after it was over as they generally do I say one of them ventured that was a pretty poem you recited that one about Verdun you know  You liked it then said Miss Lawton  Yes ma am 1 sure did But then I like poetry anyway I always did I m not much of a fighter Oh I want to help put the Kaiser out of business all right that s what we re over here for and I guess none of us are going to be satisfied till we do it But well you know what I mean I m naturally just kind of quiet and peaceful I like to read and poetry is my favorite  It s my favorite too Miss Lawton admitted  Is that a fact Maybe you d be interested in hearing about my room at home then Indeed I should Maybe it sounds funny but I m going to miss that room more  than most anything else I guess there isn t another like it anywhere It was my own idea too It s a pretty good sized room with lots of windows But that isn t what I like about it best Once when I was a little tad I saw a piece in the paper poetry it was I don t ever remember reading any poetry before but I liked that piece It was about Lincoln I thought I would paste it up on my wall where I could have it handy It s there yet right up over my wash stand After that I kept on seeing things I liked and pasting them up and now maybe you wouldn t believe it but that whole wall is all covered over I can just lie in bed or just stand around and read all sorts of things When I feel one way I read one poem and when I feel different I read another kind There was a man came out our way I live in Idaho a traveling salesman he was and he gave me a little book of poems Maybe you ve seen it it s called Poetry a Magazine of Verse Some of the best pieces were on the backs of each other and I couldn t bear to spoil them so I just tacked the whole book up Yes I guess I ll miss that room a good deal   Letters from France  Isn t that a merry tale and wouldn t you like to know what number of Poetry is hanging on his wall and what kind of a traveling salesman it was who gave it to him  Another letter is from Malcolm W Vaughn a young poet to whom we had sent a copy of The New Poetry He writes  I have had very little to read since arriving in this country yet I have needed reading more than ever before Perhaps that is one reason why the poems in this book have so deeply entered my consciousness Some of them were read in a ridiculously lighted cave to the other fellows in my section Others I read to two boys in a hospital two boys almost dying of homesickness and the sudden thrusting of themselves from out the warm light of affection which surrounded them in civil life Some of them I saved just for myself and dared not read them aloud lest I might be thought an hysterical soldier Others like the Choricos of Aldington have shuddered with me along night roads and through their bold beauty have saved me from terror at moments when one of the great shocks the explosion of an enemy shell the sudden presence of pain or awful agony the nearness of death fell without preface upon me  I remember once particularly in the drab light of a cloudy dawning when I saw near the edge of the road a poilu quietly lying i should have fainted I think from the sheer tragedy of the incident had I not heard singing in my head Aldington s invocation to Death I went closer stopping my ambulance and found that the man had given himself extreme unction For some time during that frozen night he mortally wounded had caught two plain little sticks in his hand and had crossed them Holding them thus in his stiffening fingers he had made the sign of the cross over his heart and died in the faith  The Sign of the Cross One man had made it over himself The Sign of the Cross France has made it over the bosom of her beloved land And America too is to make it  But I would not have it otherwise Too long have we received the blessings from the pyre and made no sacrifice thereon ourselves It is the full moment and I am glad to witness it when we shall offer like Abraham whatever son is needed   NOTES  Miss Eloise Robinson of Cincinnati who is now doing canteen work in France is becoming widely known as a poet although
