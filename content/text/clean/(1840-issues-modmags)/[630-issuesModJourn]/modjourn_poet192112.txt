living Out of the dust Thou hast raised me and brought me to the light of morning My eyes are full of the wonders of creation And my spirit leaps within me I behold Thy glory lifted into mountains Thy kindness deepened into valleys Thy hospitable mercies poured unmeasured in the seas  In plenteous ways Thou hast devised the telling of Thy dreams  Entreating beauty from the clay  And quickening man from out his dusty silence  Copyright 1921 by Louise Ayres Garnett All rights reserved   Thou floatest flakes of color in the air and breathing on  them Wingest them to life Thou callest the dazed leviathan up from the watery  reaches And summonest vasty creatures who come lumbering past Astonished at their being Who am I Lord of Creation that Thou shouldst think  upon me Beside a mountain or a soaring bird what am I that Thou shouldst give me place  I can praise Thee O God I can praise Thee to the summit of my singing With the flesh of me with the breath of me with the  height of me Increase my stature even as the trees Increase my stature till I pass the oak and glimpse the  towers of heaven With the waters of gratitude I brim my cup and pour it at Thy feet For thou hast shared the gift of life and my spirit sings within me  II LIFE  Into the noon of labor I go forth that I may reap my destiny   Sorrow is my lot and labor my achievement The beauty of God s handiwork my compensation Something within me springs like a fountain and urges me  to joy Sorrow is as beauty and labor as reward Thou art become a greater God O God because of my  endeavor Listen through my ears Thou of my singing sanctuary Listen through my ears that I hear Thy silent music Look through my eyes that I vision the unseen Speak through my lips that I utter words of gladness Walk Thou with me work Thou through me rest Thou  in me That I may make Thee manifest in all my ways I will praise Thee praise Thee with the labor of my hands And with the bounty of my spirit  III DEATH  Into the valley land my feet descend and man may not go with me But Thou O God companion me in love that I be unafraid The dream of death has flowered in my soul and sounds of earth fall dimly on my ears Slowly the sun goes westering in the hills and the crimson pageant of my passing hour   Flames in their deeps and moves across the sky Something within me reaches back to birth and fills me with exulting As the waters of a river sweep the wonders of creation through my being And life and death are so inseparate I know not each from each  And yet a mighty fearing falls upon me  Shadows descend and blur the crimson hills  A wind flung from a womb of ice  Blows from the shores of nothingness  The shadows shed their shoes of stealth  They run in naked swiftness from the hills  Calling the hosts of darkness  The winds sing a song of fury  The winds arise and shout their passion down the world  Drained in a pitiless draught  Are the splendors of the skies  Towers of cypress touch the heights  Even in a battlement of gloom  The towers of cypress overwhelm the heavens  My peace is perished  My dreams are fallen from me  Into the night no planet speeds its glory  The stars are drowned  Lonely the hulk of a broken moon  Lifts its bloody sail   Merged into rushing torrents are the shadows and the  winds The shadows and the winds plunge high upon the shore And swallow all the world  Why hast Thou hidden Thyself O God Why hast Thou turned Thy face aside And burdened me with night Where is my dream of death And where its sanctuary The heat of hell assails me I am consumed in bitterness and pain Reveal Thyself O unforgetting Spirit Reveal Thyself that I may be enshrined In the beauty of Thy presence Drive forth this mocking counterfeit of Death For it is Thou who art my Death O living God It is Thou who art my Death and only Thou  My fearing passes from me As a heavy mantle falling from tired shoulders My fearing slips away Candles are set at my feet that I be not lost forever Thou hast heard my cry O Great Bestower Thou hast heard my cry Thou hast lifted me up Thou hast delivered me  Now does the hush of night lie purple on the hills The moon walks softly in a trance of sleep   Her whiteness cools the passion of the skies  I hang my quiet lute upon her curve  And let the night winds chant my requiem  Waters of peace arise and drift me down the spaciousness of silence and of sleep God lights His solemn watch fires overhead to keep the vigil of man s mystery  In the triumph of surrender I take Thy gift of sleep Lean low Thou Shepherd of my dreams lean low to meet me as I lift on high The chalice of my dying  iv RE BIRTH  I feel my spirit stir and half awake  Then look in bright bewilderment at dawn  O waking past all dreaming  O Love Imperious that hast called me forth from out my valley s shadow  A mighty whirlwind breath of the living God  Sweeps from beyond the barricades of night and stooping low Lifts me from out my dust and sets me free I feel the Power that moors me to Itself That keeps the rhythmic pattern of the stars That spins like a fiery plaything in the air   The earth that was my home My hour is great with leisure My day is manifest O clamorous world thy wasting fires Have burned themselves to ashes O foolish pomp thy futile stride As an image in a glass has passed away Time s mystery and menace are resolved The Now of Man is God s Forevermore  My heart is as a forest treed with wonder The cymbals of my joyance make a stirring sound My singing shakes the day I know myself at last Thou glorious One hast revealed me to myself As new born planets sang in ecstasy So sing the voices of my thankfulness I praise Thee I glorify Thee Thou art the Singer man Thy Song My spirit on its summit shouts Thy name  O Singer Who hast sent me forth I am returned to Thee  Louise Ayres Garnett    THE HOSTAGE  In dead of dark to his starry North Saint Nicholas drew near He had ranged the world this wintry night His elk bells jangling clear Now bitter worn with age was he And weary of mankind for few Had shown him love or courtesy  His sacks lay empty all save one And this to his affright Stirred as he stooped with fingers numb Ablaze with hoar frost bright Aghast he stood Showed fumbling thumb Small shoulder a wing what stowaway Was this and whence was t come  And out there crept a lovely Thing Half angel and half child I youngest of all Heaven am here to be thy joy he smiled O Nicholas our Master Christ thy grief hath seen and He Hath bidden me come to keep His tryst and bring His love to thee To serve thee well and sing Nowell and thine own son to be  Walter de la Mare   SUPERNAL DIALOGUE Two beings Stood on the edge of things Their breath was space And their eyes were suns I It was this way he passed I know the sound II More worlds He can not forbear I Look down this lane It was dark till he passed Do you see anything II Seeds of light glowing whirling A handful I Separating now II Fierce fire balls So many so many The perfect flower Will he get what he wants I Flower of delight to bloom beside his throne Sometime he will A pause I Look that little one Burning aching Trailing its tiny orbs 125  II Which one I See scarlet oh alive Deep in that right hand cluster near the dark II With tiny trailers will it be one of them That clouded one maybe I Look it foams down The clouds lift There are seas II Lands a creeping green Sounds of air moving I Hush oh whisper do you see Dark specks that crawl And wings that flash in the air II Spawn immeasurably minute What does he mean the fecund one creating without reason or mercy I He must life is his song He dreams he wills II Watch now they change those atoms They stand on end they lay stone on stone They go clad they utter words I Proud they take their spoil Kings and slaves II Oh queer ingenious They gather in towns They filch our fires to carry them over land and sea I They measure the stars they love they dream II But war pain obliterative war and pain I So brief each one a tiny puff and out Grotesque A few look up salute us before they fall A few dare face him Is it enough A pause I It cools down their whirling world It is silent cold II Has he lost again Can he fail Who are we to question Though he fail again and again Yes who are we He must go on he must get the flower Two beings Stood on the edge of things Their breath was space And their eyes were suns Harriet Monroe    POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TWO NEGRO SPIRITUALS  A DREAM  I had a dream last night a wonderful dream I saw an angel riding in a chariot Oh my honey it was a lovely chariot Shining like the sun when noon is on the earth I saw his wings spreading from moon to earth I saw a crown of stars upon his forehead I saw his robes agleaming like his chariot I bowed my head and let the angel pass Because no man can look on Glory s work I bowed my head and trembled in my limbs Because I stood on ground of holiness I heard the angel in the chariot singing  Hallelujah early in the morning I know my Redeemer liveth How is it with your soul  I stood on ground of holiness and bowed The River Jordan flowed past my feet As the angel soothed my soul with song A song of wonderful sweetness I stooped and washed my soul in Jordan s stream Ere my Redeemer came to take me home I stooped and washed my soul in waters pure As the breathing of a new born child   Lying on a mammy s breast at night I looked and saw the angel descending And a crown of stars was in his hand Be ye not amazed good friend he said I bring a diadem of righteousness A covenant from the Lord of life That in the morning you will see Eternal streets of gold and pearl aglow And be with me in blessed Paradise  The vision faded I awoke and heard A mocking bird upon my window sill  THE WONDERFUL MORNING  When it is morning in the cornfield I am to go and meet my Jesus  Riding on His white horse When it is morning in the cornfield I am to be there in my glory  Shout my brethren Shout my sisters I am to meet the King of Morning Way down in the cornfield  Fenton Johnson   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  HANDFUL OF ASHES  THE CAPTIVE  Beauty that shakes in lights Beauty that gleams in mists Loveliness of still nights  Gold of the stars that twists Ribbon like into the sea Beauty is calling me  Delicate crimson flames Jewels with long histories Mysterious oft said names  Blossoms beneath great trees Melodies deep and low Call me I can not go  Heliotrope jasmine rose Lovers at crumbling gates Silence when eyelids close  cliffs where the sea bird mates Beauty holds these for me Whose eyes are too blind to see  Beauty when sunbeams blur Calls me again and again I can not answer her Beauty shall call me in vain   Dorothy Dow  Sadly from year to year Passion has chained me here  WAITING  If you should walk in the park and not find me Or go in the market place and not see me Would you not search further Does not your heart tell you I am somewhere Go out on the long roads I may be at the end of one  The sea to the ship The river to the little boat The cloud to the swallow One for the other always And I for you forever  FUTILITY  The nights grow long and the days cold I dream of you and love The dead leaf falling from the tree Is not more sad than memory Nor is the rising wind as bold As were your lips on me  What are you thinking of  The streets and trees and people pass Like words beneath my pen   Symbols below a painted sky I have no part in them I lie Futile as footsteps on the grass Wind torn storm drenched I long to die You might remember then  BOUND  Take away the magic  You have put on me I am held by whispers I who would be free  I who would be free and false Why must I be true I fear to move for hurting The clinging thoughts of you  So the sunny branches  Beckon me in vain I beside the hearth fire Huddle to my pain  Dorothy Dow   FROM A BAY WINDOW  My world is a pane of glass These only Of the shadowy without are mine They that pass The gray birds fluttering by The cloud that sometimes sails Over the chimney bitten sky When all else fails  AUTUMN RAIN  To eyes hollow With the gray distress The passing swallow Is all but a caress  STEEPLES  They gaily pass Within Who would be freed en masse Of sin  PORTRAIT OF AN OLD LADY  Up flutters a hand to caress Midway in the prayer Her Sabbath dress The frail gray of her hair   TO A DEAD LOVE  Why O love Shall I not sing Who above her child Would plant a flowering thing  TO FELIX  Clear as water pooled in a cup I hear your thoughts Through all the spaciousness of my unrest You have no place For the white bird at my breast Or the face your hands lift up  APRIL SNOW  Oh your words are bitter to me As these last flakes of snow are To the little shining buds but no bud That glistens like a raindrop on a tree Is so fresh with love  SOLACE  Knock at my pane With your finger tips O rain   Pearl Andelson  BEACH SONG  What are they weaving under the water They make sheer laces and drag them down They ruffle a lawn with a great grieving What are they making what manner of gown  What are they weaving caught here Caught there on the thin washed blue Who is to be married or who is to be buried Under the water under the water  SONG ON DEATH  Death comes inexorably His pale deft hand Is never still Swift and impalpable He comes taking what he will Life is a circle Which has gone its round He tarries Where old women sit peering at the ground  OUT OF A CAVALCADE OF DUST  In such a white procession In such a guise The dead might return With pantomime of lips and eyes  Pearl Andelson   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  GREY CRUST  I am weary unto desire of death Of the thought fretting in my body Of the body wrapped round my thought  They go The curious panting creatures I would be Along the grey crust of the street  I would be fused into her Girl going whither I know not I would have her shrill eager breasts Gusts of storm driving the sail of her blouse Her round polished knees rising moving like pendulums Engines urging the sail of her skirt Her sharp bird like head cleaving the sail of the wind I would have the curious blood of her I would have her dream  I would be fused into him Child carried in the arms of a mother Child carried whither he knows not I would have the gurgling mirth Emanating from gay colored baubles The shiver the sweat and the nightmare Emanating from dark wrangling shadows I would have his untinted history   Laurence Vail  And the hunger To seize the whole world by the mouth  I would be fused into anyone going new ways  Laurence Vail  TWO POEMS  WILL POWER  I would rather grind my teeth to powder I would rather tread barefoot on thin sharp stones I would rather let the blood of my veins freeze to red ice And the muscles of my legs stiffen to cold stone  Than be drawn by the warm breath Of transient things  I would rather But yet I am being drawn I am being drawn   PAIN  It is The hush that falls When screaming chords drawn taut Break with a sudden snap and then Recoil  Henry Saul Zolinsky   POETRY A Magazine of Verse ARPEGGIO September  The bamboo stalks quiver Only one sways toward the moon face  October  Spider telegraph

Sitting on a bench facing God s beautiful lake A poem to God beautiful  Lake Michigan The love a poor sick body held Sifted by the sift of a hundred nights of pain A poor sick body gave it all to you  Your absinthe Has intoxicated me  Having risen out of your waters In front of my great eyes now There is a mad blur of sunlight And the City spread out before me calling from a great  curve Come enter conquistador  The line of your horizon pure and long hitched to the infinite both ways Where the mist lies like Peace  Swimming I flirted with Death Saw death running over the shadow laced ripples And turned around as you threw water in my eyes And laughed at Death as Death s brother the devil  would   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  You slammed open the doors of the sky And there stood the tremendous sun  Lake gilded in the morning I have come out of you A fresh water Neptune And the water rang little bells Trickling down Along my flesh Lake garden of the colors Sweet breathing mouth of Chicago Words die in the fingers of a sick man As children dying on a poor father Take my promise lake  SLEEP  At the bottom of the abyss of sleep A black cradle rocks Pain slight with evanescent fingers Pushes it Under the cradle is earth To cover and stifle you  AUBADE  The morning now Is a white corpse The nightmares   Emanuel Carnevali  Killed her Vainly the breeze Wafts a terrible sadness Over her body  ENCOUNTER  Little grey lady sitting by the roadside in the cold My fire is to warm you not to burn you up  Little grey lady in your little grey house in the warmth Your warmth is to loosen my frozen arms and tongue Not to drowse me  SERMON  Chao Mong Mu freely laid his hands over the sky You do not know how to lay your hands over the breasts of your beloved  Chao Mong Mu made the tree dance at his will You do not know how to hug a rough tree and say darling to it  Chao Mong Mu magnificently ran a shaft of sunlight to smash against the treetops You walk carefully carefully and fend off the sunlight with your grey clothes although you re very poor   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Chao Mong Mu painted a sky that was a pink fleshed vase then he became a very small thing and hid in the vase  You build yourselves immense houses to live in and you are afraid even there  HOPE  Tomorrow will be beautiful For tomorrow comes out of the lake  INSOMNIA  For a year his desperate hands beat the darkness Then out of their rhythm a monster was created Three claws on his breast so that he could not with facility heave it Three claws on his skull so that he had waking nightmares the year long  When at last his hands dropped the monster stooped over him and with his yellow beak plucked out his white heart  SMOKE  All the smoke of the cigarettes of dreamers went over to the sky and formed that blue vault you see up there   FUNERAL MARCH  The great corpse Is the crowd  A whole day It takes to bury it  In the morning They begin  Not at night For they re afraid  I m here for Oh to wail a great goodbye  ITALIAN SONG  Until your lips be red Until the winter time Until the money be gone  Until God see us  Until God see us  Until old age come girl Until the other man come Until the jettatura get me  Until God see us  Until God see us   OLD ACCUSTOMED IMPUDENT GHOST  That morning the dawn arose from the sodden grey city pavements  And it was a sick grey breath  I had spent myself asking the night for sleep  Broken in pieces I was only the evil spirit was whole in me  There was a curse on my bitten bloody lips   And then   Oh then the old accustomed impudent ghost came in He wore my bagged ragged pants and was unshaven And his face was the one I had seen in the mirror Too many times  INVOCATION TO DEATH  Let me Close my eyes tight  Still my arms  Let me  Be  Then  Come  Let me be utterly alone  Do not let the awful understanding that comes with  The thought of Death  Bother me   Your love was not strong enough to hold me  Death takes things away I have them here in my hands The rags  I do not understand the cosmic humor That lets foolish impossibilities like me live  I have made a mess of it But I am no debtor  It s the yearning of a nervous man The yearning for peace The curiosity for a word Forever  If She would only come quietly Like a lady The first lady and the last  Just not to hear any longer The noise swelling from the morning streets Nor the two desperate sparrows chirruping Just not to fear any longer The landlady  Emanuel Carnevali  COMMENT  RENEWAL OF YOUTH  HE Christmas season winter clad as it is always utters the prophecy of youth Celebrating the birth of a great renewer of life it rings the first far away bell waves the first red and green banner to usher in the springtime It reminds us of the perennial miracle the unconquerable hope and joy forever freshly blooming in the new life of this earth  The passage of the generations that is the great poem The long epic of birth growth and decay the struggle of life to assert its dominion over destructive forces the momentary conquest and the final defeat this is the universal story of which all lesser tales are mere chapters and paragraphs Absorbed in our small affairs singing our individual little solos we too often miss the immense chorus vibrating grandly through the ages a chorus which accepts and harmonizes the whir of the cricket and the long drum roll of the stars  Life s bitter and unceasing fight is against the forces of decay when it lapses and turns to fight the forces of growth the result is confusion and disaster Through the battering by young minds alone may each generation forget to grow old therefore let youth be free and strong let it have room for its race and its shout lest bars and shackles enslave the next age   The battering by young minds perhaps an editor s office especially a poetry editor s office is the place most accessible of all to such battering the place where some of the freest and strongest of young minds love to put up their first stiff fight against the forces of decay Too often they find these forces entrenched in the editorial chair so that the battlefield is conveniently narrowed down and the issue personified And the editor if he waives all advantage of position age experience etc will have to put up the best fight he is capable of and often come out second best at the end of it  A recent article on This Youngest Generation by Malcolm Cowley New York Evening Post Literary Review of October 15th shows with what a simple gesture the young mind can throw away the immediate past at least of its own race and language Youth must avenge itself not on the honored dead but on the too much honored living and so we find Shaw and Wells and Mencken and all the Georgian poets and prosers and oh yes Chesterton and Schnitzler and Nathan cast into the discard while youth is reading Flaubert and Laforgue and Huys mans diving deeper into the past toward Swift and Defoe Racine Molière even Marlowe Ben Jonson and Shakespeare and then coming up again to salute Remy de Gourmont and certain new groups of French poets to whom he showed the way Through all this the young writers are shaping their own ideals there is to be a new interest in form a simplification of current   life into something rich and strange our younger literature will be at least as well composed as a good landscape it may even attain to the logical organization of music  Form simplification strangeness respect for literature as an art with traditions abstractness these are the catchwords that are repeated most often among the younger writers They represent ideas that have characterized French literature hitherto rather than English or American They are the nearest approach to articulate doctrine of a generation without a school and without a manifesto  he roi est mort but he has prepared the people for the new reign  The great advantage of this generation is the fact that a public has been formed It has been formed exactly by those inchoate realists like Dreiser and by those anti Puritanical critics like H L Mencken against whom this youngest generation is in revolt But gratitude is not a literary virtue  Yes here as elsewhere gratitude is the rarest of the shall we say not virtues but graces It is an education in a still rarer virtue and grace humility to note how easily the rising generation puts the risen one in its place Shaw Mencken Dreiser how they pawed the ground and trod the air not so long ago What rebels iconoclasts they were as they leapt all barriers toward the glamourous goal of art Now conquering youth is mounted soon he will ride them down with joy Le roi est mort for what happy heir shall we soon be shouting Vive le roi   Renewal of Youth  Yes the wave movement of the arts is one phase of the universal epic Birth growth decay new birth fresh growth and yet at last decay the rule is for you and me as well as another and in each of us it is proved So hail to conquering Youth even to sacred Infancy in its mother s arms May the newly risen or newly born solve the riddles and sing the songs of the world May he rid the earth of war and disease of poverty and ignorance famine of body and soul May he complete nature s beauty with the beauty of art and nature s truth with the truth of the spirit and lead on the millennium to which we all aspire H M  ALEXANDER BLOK  Alexander Blok s death in the late summer is a loss not only to Russia but to world literature He was forty one years of age and had achieved international fame only during the last two years through the circulation of his revolutionary lyric The Twelve He was the first distinguished Russian writer to espouse openly the Bolshevist cause and was one of the few first rate imaginations which seem to have been sufficiently nourished upon the black bread of revolution In his youth he was a writer of intense and remote lyrics full of mystic vision and the pungent odor of the flowers of evil The translators point out that Blok owed a cultural allegiance to the old order But he had from the first like the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  typical Russian peasant adored the Christ hanging in  tormented effigy at the wind raked cross roads and  marching before the poor their Brother of compassion  and it was inevitable that Blok should not despair of  the blind violent but spiritual people discovering in  their wild fury the elements of redemption  For the world of intellectual irony seemed to him rotten and ready for destruction The nineteenth century he wrote has cast upon the living face of man a blinding mask of mechanics positivism and economic materialism and has drowned the human voice in the rumble and roar of machinery As to whether Blok felt before he died that the administrators of this revolution were betraying their ideal loving Her in heaven and betraying Her on earth opinions seem to differ Certainly there is little likeness between the cold dedicated Cromwellian executives who now direct the Soviet government and the twelve mystic roisterers of Blok s The Twelve writen in 1918  This poem the Russian edition of which exceeded two million copies was recently translated by Miss Deutsch and Dr Yarmolinsky It portrays the procession through the streets of Red Petrograd of twelve holy ruffians looting killing singing The scheme of the poem is bold and flexible including revolutionary songs an episode of low passion and jealousy terminated by murder and penetrating lyric passages with a movement like the folk song There is occasional convincing   symbolism as when the old order is personified by a mangy cur Beatings are the best you ll get Behind all the lurid light and noise is the huge bare vision the flat endless unmoved steppe  Hutted Russia Thick rumped and solid Russia the stolid  In the storm and cold the blackguards stumble on like disciples of a starved gray bearded introspective Dionysus At the end of the poem they meet their master inscrutable pitying crowned with flowers the white untouched Christ bearing the red flag  In mist white roses garlanded Christ marches on The twelve are led  The Twelve is a stirring battle song which will not soon be dissociated from the history of these mysterious blood dripping days The translation while it gives little impression of beauty as English verse permits the smoky fire of the original to shine through  Glenway Wescott  REVIEWS  A FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS  Second April by Edna St Vincent Millay Mitchell  Kennerley  If I could only sound a fanfare in words If I could get up on some high place and blow trumpets and shout   and wave my hands and throw my hat If too I could gather together all those of my dear friends who have said Oh yes I like poetry well enough Longfellow and Byron and those of course I admit I can t understand this modern stuff And if I could gather together all the shrugging shoulders all the supercilious smiles and all those brows which have knitted at the mention of poetry and could read to them or get Edna St Vincent Millay to read to them if it were only possible her latest book Second April And then if I could give it to all those hungry people who have not the money for beauty and give it to children even be generous with it and let it lie on the library table of the fashionable house beside the Golden Treasury where it might  be picked up by the casual caller so that he would get drunk in a new way And later after the shy emotions and the jaded ones have had their dance in the sun if I could get away to some deserted place of beauty and hold a solitary revel an orgy of poetry  And yet even if the copies of Second April rained down like manna I suppose there would still be some among the most needy to spurn the fare some who would look and look in vain for intricacies of form for startling words for grotesque similes for splashing impressionistic phrases And there would be those who would think an occasional sonnet indecent because it flings high unashamed the joy of living  Not with libation but with shouts and laughter   We drenched the altars of Love s sacred grove Shaking to earth green fruits impatient after The launching of the colored moths of Love Love s proper myrtle and his mother s zone We bound about our irreligious brows And fettered him with garlands of our own And spread a banquet in his frugal house Not yet the god has spoken but I fear Though we should break our bodies in his flame And pour our blood upon his altar here Henceforward is a grove without a name A pasture to the shaggy goats of Pan Whence flee forever a woman and a man  Perhaps there would be some to belittle the group of  memorial poems each one of which is so childlike in its  simplicity so utterly utterly poignant  Heap not on this mound Roses that she loved so well Why bewilder her with roses That she cannot see or smell She is happy where she lies With the dust upon her eyes  And the stark tragedy of the Chorus Give away her gowns Give away her shoes She has no more use For her fragrant gowns Take them all down Blue green blue Lilac pink blue From their padded hangers She will dance no more In her narrow shoes Sweep her narrow shoes From the closet floor   And there would be the happy young girl who confided to me that she could not see anything particularly wonderful or apt in the sentence Life in itself is nothing an empty cup a flight of uncarpeted stairs  To what purpose April do you return again  Beauty is not enough  You can no longer quiet me with the redness  Of little leaves opening stickily  I know what I know  The sun is hot on my neck as I observe  The spikes of the crocus  The smell of the earth is good  It is apparent that there is no death  But what does that signify  Not only under ground are the brains of men  Eaten by maggots  Life in itself  Is nothing  An empty cup a flight of uncarpeted stairs  It is not enough that yearly down this hill  April  Comes like an idiot babbling and strewing flowers  Yet in spite of them all and I believe there could only be a few the meticulous the unfortunates whose emotions have irretrievably atrophied in spite of them and right in their faces I would shout aloud blow trumpets wave hands and scatter Edna St Vincent Millay s Second April over the world  Marion Strobel   FLETCHERIAN COLORS  Breakers and Granite by John Gould Fletcher Mac  millan Co  This volume of poems while not a definite attempt to comprehend and express the spirit of America by combining various groups leaves a general impression The spirit which speaks loudest however is a universal one although our ardent patriotism usually leads us to confine it to America  It is a palimpsest which no one reads or understands which none has time to heed a loom frame woven over with interspersed entangled threads of which the meaning is lost from which the pattern is not yet freed  They are a great shallow sea crinkling uneasily as if some giant s body were wallowing beneath  The shuttles clatter and clamor and hammer at the woof of day and night But the being the thing that will master all the ages still refuses to be born  One does not squeeze this essence from the book but finds it imbedded in long descriptions externally conceived often with the eye of a decorator nicely designed more often with the hand of an artisan who labors over his pile of adjectives and colors and leaves a jumble  Down the Mississippi is the best group It has a sculptural quality in spite of certain passages which with their natural southern heat threaten to melt the modeling into a mass But it is an excellent group A   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  fine conception of a great river moulded and colored by sensitive hands guided by sympathetic eyes  Of his prose poems The Building of Chicago The Old South and The Song of the Wind The Old South is the most completely satisfying It has quality and cadence and flavor It charms and saddens and leaves a stagnant pool in the spirit The other prose poems in the volume work out of inspiration hours There are some interesting photographs some historical descriptions An effort is made at times to heighten them to the point of poetry by the use of the names of strong colors but the words are cold they do not flush from within The lines are sterile and hanging decorations on them does not make them burgeon  In New York this sentence begins well Ivory and gold heart of light petrified bold and immortally beautiful lifts a tower like a full lily stalk  Then it grows hysterical  With crammed pollen coated petals flame calyx fretted and carven white phoenix that beats its wings in the light shrill ecstasy of leaping lines poised in flight partaken of joy in the skies mate of the sun  We frequently encounter this violent use of language but for the most part the poet s carousals in the names of colors fail to intoxicate him  In The Grand Canyon of The Colorado  Yellow red grey green purple black chasms fell swiftly below each other  and   hammered from red sandstone purple granite and gold  fail in their purpose while  It was hidden Behind layers of white silence  paints a picture  Again take from The Well in the Desert  The desert below him seems burning ashen yellow red yellow faint blue and rose brown  and  At the horizon The heat rose and fell Sharp flickering arpeggios   Not a cloud flake breaks with its shadow the great space of sky and of earth  The last two are Japanese prints while the first is a colored photograph Mr Fletcher s use of colors makes one feel their limitations only occasionally does one feel their infinite variety  The poems to the eye seem unrestrained but there is not the flamboyant coloring of youth in these pages Taking the volume as a whole one feels a prodigal use of words of color but a paucity of colored words If the Japanese prints a few of which it undoubtedly possesses were selected from the whole we should have a slimmer volume but a more rarely beautiful collection  Laura Sherry   MINOR CHORDS  Bluestone by Marguerite Wilkinson Macmillan Co Selected Poems by Lady Margaret Sackville E P Dutton  amp Co  These two books have no likeness of matter or manner that innately justifies their being written about together My apology is that the authors of both are women and that the books are both provided with prefaces so provocative that they stimulate attention perhaps more than the poetry itself  Marguerite Wilkinson s preface is autobiographical like her verses It invites us into her workshop as in her poems she invites us candidly into her homely house of life into the kitchen and living rooms and the empty nursery to show us the vistas she likes her porch and garden her big husband to chat a little about her ancestors and the poor and the weather and to confide the mournful secret of her childlessness In her workshop she lets us stand by while between the stages of her demonstration of lyric making she gives an informal lecture  To report the lecture briefly for a summary may be made in a sentence the poet may help himself by finding the tune which exists for each expression and building them up together She says  What happens is simply this While I am making a lyric after the mood becomes clear after the idea and image emerge from consciousness I sing it and sometimes slowly sometimes quite rapidly the words take their places in lines that carry a tune also I am not giving conscious   Minor Chords  effort to the tune nor am I making an intellectual effort to combine words and music to get a certain effect I am not thinking about the music I am making a single hearted and strong endeavor to say or sing what is felt or thought  This leaves one well elbowed for reflection Is this the way epics and folk songs were written did the bards and skalds and troubadours make their resonant verses thus Is it analogous to the activities of any other poet say Kreymborg or Vachel Lindsay in their somewhat readier improvisation  As for the poems themselves they are individually undistinguished But a full sequential reading of them makes one aware of a bright impulsive open temperament a small clear voice singing a small clear soul It is frank and personal in the way that women are frank and personal not a challenge but a confidence It is autobiography as self concerned and intimate in its demure scale as that of Benvenuto Cellini  Mrs Wilkinson writes most stridently most rhetorically when as in the title poem she invokes ancestors Songs from beside Swift Rivers is a pleasant energetic group although it contains the worst thing in the book The Really Truly Twirly whirly Eel In Preferences Long Songs Songs of an Empty House Songs of Laughter and Tears Whims for Poets and California Poems she does better work These in a certain way satisfy if they dò not thrill us they are if not original personal Here she is busy on her autobiography she tells a small old story offers a bright comment   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  The closing poem however The Pageant is to my mind the finest of the book It is almost the only impersonal poem It is not new or profound but it is a conceit such as comes coolly from the hands of women whereas men s hands mold sweatily and hard also men s eyes are sneeringly careless while women s are maternally watchful I will quote the second stanza and take my leave of a book pleasant but not upsetting containing some singularly inept verses which however may help in the final witnessing of an unheroic untormented and engaging personality  Forever is a broad road where have met together Brave Deeds in red robes and Deeds of golden fire Grave Deeds in silver gowns quaint Deeds in motley Quiet Deeds in homely gray that only saints admire Gentle Deeds that love the green raiment of the summer Pure Deeds in very white without the chill of snow Squalid Deeds in dull rags pitiful and ugly Down the broad highway they go  The testimonial to Lady Margaret Sackville s Selected Poems is written by no less a doctor than Wilfrid Scawen Blunt It is short and perfunctory having the familiar sound of the literary ballyhoo It begins by calling her ladyship the best of England s woman poets Being quite ignorant of the poetry young Britannia is writing I cannot enter into controversy But I remember some sharp work by the feminine Sitwell and some interesting perceptions in quotations from Charlotte Mew and even though the women of talent like the men are diluting their poetry in the traditional English schooner the novel Virginia Wolf May Sinclair Dorothy Richardson E M Delafield   and others there must be women who are writing poetry less pallid and Hellenic and more original than this  Mr Blunt like other comfortable people is waiting for the world to quiet down to its ancient bourgeois ways of peace prosperity romance and beauty We may look for the blooming of an art that will cover the ruins a peaceful bourgeois poetry written in the benignant lattice tempered daylight of sound rhyme metre and melody like Lady Sackville s It will even be free from the rhetorical independence of blank verse which is not really verse at all even in master hands say rather a dignified kind of prose pompous in recitation and for common reading dull  Mr Blunt is sure it will emerge from the bewildered forms of the delirium such profound powerful denying poetry as is being written by D H Lawrence the imagists the Sitwells and Aldous Huxley I gather that Mr Blunt means them although he mentions no names Their work is a delirium to him because their subject matter is not the Greek hash served up by a muse whom people have made a slavey but fresh fodder pungently spiced that gives savor and nourishment because their measures are ungentle and their language cleaned and filtered of the débris of overlapping preciosities  In spite of this survivor of the nineties such feeble voices as Lady Sackville s will inevitably be silenced by the delirium True it is a voice of some subtle cadences of a tone pleasing and serene It even murmurs some   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  exquisite lyrics offers some sonorous recitations makes a shy jest But it observes all the politeness of conventional rhyming it never leaves its orderly park of cultivated flower beds exhaling a luxurious odor with nymphs and fauns pensive among the trees fastened forever in the postures of elegantly sylvan courtship  There is a staid deliberate and wise sentiment in the war poems They are not poignant or biographical but they are pitying even querulous comments upon an organized cataclysm They are bright bits of emotion like bright colors against an elegant but monotonous background  Lady Sackville s poetry has none of the impulse and swing of Marguerite Wilkinson s It is impersonal and detached and does not leave us as a palpable presence But it has greater delicacy mellower polish maturer choice of material One can see in these books an analogy for England and America if England did not have its own revoltes and America its bland traditionalists  Isidor Schneider  POST MARTIAL EMOTION  Aurelia and Other Poems by Robert Nichols E P  Dutton and Co  From the ardors and endurances of war this poet like many another has retired into his sensibilities It is a luxury no doubt justified in one who suffered so severe a war experience as Robert Nichols but it is a disappoint   ment to many who read his first book From this earlier book there were two courses possible one to retain the war experience if not its incidents as a structural fact in his future work the other to throw it away as one would a soiled and bloody shirt and return to the cool sterile delicacies of his domestic experience With the exception of the beautifully reminiscent Yesterday the poet in this book has returned frankly to pre war psychology and subject matter The book as a whole including Four Idylls Encounters twenty seven Elisa bethan Sonnets to Aurelia The Flower of Flame has assumed in manner emotion and subject the conventional limitations of the finely wrought but minor poetry of academic England  If war came without welcome a thick and bulging episode in his experience its subsidence at any rate has not left the poet voiceless The transition from his engravings on the crude steel of war to their continuation on the ivory of peace is no doubt appropriate to this type of poet Three strains of interest none of them associated with warlike violence may be noted A contemplative and introspective interest as in Night Rhapsody  How beautiful to wake at night Within the room grown strange and still and sweet And live a century while in the dark The dripping wheel of silence slowly turns To watch the window open on the night A dewy silent deep where nothing stirs   And lying thus to feel dilate within The press the conflict and the heavy pulse Of incommunicable sad ecstasy  An interest in nature observation as in From the Budded Branch  Below a beetle on a stalk of grass Slowly unharnesses his shuttered wings His tiny rainbow wings of shrivelled glass He leaps He whirs away The grass blade swings  An interest in personal emotion as in the tritely facile  Sonnets to Aurelia  Whatever substances of love may dwell Within the passionate heart of such as I Whatever waters of pure pity well In the dark orb of a most loving eye I have yielded you Whatever were the pain If power within me so to do did live I at your need had made these yours again But now I know I have no more to give  But the weaver of these has not yet a certain hand His imaginative facility his ability to subordinate the crude image to the structural idea of his poem without diminishing its vividness his technical excellence in poetic detail do not save him from casualness in the larger principles of his work  It is unfortunate that Robert Nichols should have only the poised and static culture of his particular English group to support him Rarely if ever does he break over the narrow boundaries of self centered sophistication   of fagged and too mature emotion Mr Nichols and his group seem to be too little in literary touch with the massive energies of contemporary life to be moved by any great or unifying poetic idea The environment is luxuriously sweet to the minor poet but its very graciousness undermines stronger men It is too small a pot for great broth In the gratuitous energy of great poetry this book is lacking Baker Brownell  COLOR SONATAS  Poems by Iris Tree John Lane Co  An organ exists which plays in color instead of in tone and pitch Its invention was a recognition of the synes thetic power which every artist to some extent possesses the power to translate images received through one sense into terms of another sense  If one could carry the principle of synesthesia inventively several steps farther than the color organ and produce a device that would interpret sound in terms of fragrance and color in terms of odor and so on one would have something very like Iris Tree s book It is to quote her own words a kaleidoscope of roaring color using the word color itself in a rather synesthetic sense Such figures as scarlet rhapsodies and beryl cold sonatas The pale smell of their falling blossoms and Its scent is sweeter than ghostly music are characteristic  Rebecca West I believe once referred to the works of   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Compton Mackenzie as not precisely novels but brilliantly colored cushions I have somewhat the same feeling about Iris Tree s volume it does not seem exactly a book It is not a cushion sometimes it seems a tapestry at other times a bouquet of highly perfumed flowers and still again a series of ariettes This is nothing against it anybody can make a book that seems like a book but few can make a book that seems like well perhaps a kaleidoscope is the most inclusive term The author in her own words opens wide  the violet petalled doors Of every shy and cloistered sense That all the scent and music of the world May rush into the soul  The poems are dazzling arresting with imagery now  a bit Keatsian in suggestion but more often altogether  modern Verses like these represent the author s method  Moonlit lilacs under the window And the pale smell of their falling blossoms And the white floating beams like luminous moths Fluttering from bloom to bloom Sprays of lilac flowers Frothing at the green verge of midnight waves Frozen to motionless icicles Moonlight flows over me Full of illicit marvelous perfumes Wreathed with syringa and plaited with hyacinths Hair of the moonlight falling about me Straight and cool as the drooping tresses of rain  The spiritual interpretations which the author makes are as unvivid as her imagery is vivid Neither the dim   psychic crystals of her soul nor her wish that she were God in a colored globe moves one to more than casual interest Perhaps this is partly because one looks for sensuous instead of spiritual beauties in a kaleidoscope  Illustrations and decorations usually spoil a book of poems In this case the decorations done by Curtis Moffatt the author s husband have the same quality as the verses and add to their flavor  Nelson Antrim Crawford  THE PREMATURITY OF IMMATURITY  Hidden Path by Ned Hungerford Privately printed  It is hard to call this the poetry of a young man There is feeling and experience in it it is immature not in knowledge of life but in the mechanics of expression in the practice of poetic craftsmanship Where other poets can amble and even trip gaily and gracefully in well trodden and frequented ways Mr Hungerford plods lonely and stumbling He presents almost pathetically the figure of a man desperately concerned with self expression not as a necessity born with him but out of some troubling circumstance I feel that things are maddeningly dull for Mr Hungerford wherever he is that he has an insup pressible desire to find a kinder environment  That is why opening his book gave me the thrill that a man might feel if he picked up a stray message from a lost man say something in a bottle or between the halves of a fruit There is a distracting personal interest in   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  every poem that makes its status as poetry unimportant And the regrettable element in the matter is that the author deliberately aims to achieve this effect He writes in his introductory poem  Reader That these poems are now in your hands Is proof that they are meant for you Whatever your race color or creed you are brother To him who wrote them And to him who placed them in your hands  It is the old plea of the beginner not sure of his audience the old futile defiance of criticism futile because of its unconscious confession of a lack of technique Somewhere else in the book he makes the stock challenge  O ready condemners Isn t it just possible You and I are thinking of something Entirely different  The persistent illusion of being misunderstood when one is merely ignored the illusion that others in his plight may take heart from his avowals is the inspiration of a good many of these poems Throughout the reader is left with the consciousness of listening to a muddled eager man who can hardly resist the temptation to buttonhole his few auditors The very titles of this and a previous book Hidden Path Uncertain Trail give Mr Hungerford s own estimate of his literary journey  If Ned Hungerford is comparatively young he may find out eventually whither he is bound in which case he   The Prematurity of Immaturity  will regret publishing this misgiven itinerary If he is not a young man and is bogged fast in bewildering crossroads the book will be one more of the crowded minor fatalities on the literary front From any standpoint it is premature it may have satisfied momentarily a craving to appear in print but already it must have obliterated that satisfaction by coming back in all its gruesome immaturity to haunt its author It would have been passed over in silence but as it is typical of many books of verse sent out in quest of reviews the above remarks may serve as a hint to other self deceived and often embittered would be poets Isidor Schneider CORRESPONDENCE  THE ALLIED ARTS AGAIN  I  Dear Editor It was with great interest that I read in POETRY for October your comments upon my Musical America article I am glad to have the opportunity and the invitation to express an opinion I have long held  I believe we should have something in the nature of a National Committee for the Protection of the Native Lyric from the Distortions Practised by Incompetent Composers Poets when asked for permission to make settings of their words often grant it graciously and trust to luck What a writer ought to do is to tell the   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  composer to make a setting and submit it to him for approval But as few poets are willing to profess expertness in musical judgments the writer usually has to submit to whatever outrageous interpretation the composer may perpetrate I see no reason why a poet should not say to a composer Yes you may make a setting of my poem provided that before publishing it you will submit it to a committee on which both poetry and music are represented Such a committee would be a step toward establishing a standard and perhaps it might do a great deal in ways other than censorship to stimulate the progress of American song  One other thing might be spoken of as a possible reason why there is not greater co operation among poets and musicians often of late the poet talks business and proposes a division of royalty whereupon the negotiations are soon at an end There are different reasons in different cases but usually this happens because the composer knows if he has ever published anything that the royalty will be too small to divide a fact which he dislikes to confess even to a fellow artist And he does not want to be forced to keep books and mail out each month a cheque which would probably fluctuate between two dollars and six If there is money in music publishing the music publisher must get most of it  Referring again to your editorial you express doubt whether I have taken the trouble to get acquainted with or try to understand contemporary poets But   The Allied Arts Again  I can plead guilty only in part I have not been able to keep pace with all our American poets it is true but I have known some of them and I am eager to meet others and try to understand their art  Instead of citing Carpenter s settings of the Tagore things in your editorial you might more fitly have mentioned his use of The Heart s Country by Florence Wilkinson or the delightful song Henry Hadley made last year out of When I Go Away from You by Amy Lowell  Please let me say in conclusion that I never have said there were not fine American songs But they are remarkably few and remarkably hard to place effectively in a recital programme Charles Albert Case  Northampton Mass  II  Dear POETRY TO all serious students of the dance the first sentence in your October article POETRY would like to celebrate its ninth birthday by inaugurating a closer affiliation with the allied arts of music and the drama perhaps also the dance is encouraging That perhaps is deserved only those who come in daily contact with the too popular belief that the door to real achievement may be kicked open by a perfectly pointed toe can realize how far the dance has traveled from its dignified origin In alliance with that music and poetry to which the dance really gave birth lies her only hope Music and poetry give the dancer a reason for existence   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  We had the pleasure of working with Alfred Kreymborg in the summer of 1920 and not only felt that we as dancers had profited but we gained an insight into and a feeling for the rhythm of modern poetry that nothing but the actual bodily expression of it could have given us We have been fortunate also in being associated with a musician who has used pieces of Sara Teasdale s Vachel Lindsay s Bliss Carman s and other moderns as themes for dance music  Certainly poets musicians and dancers need not fear to join forces They have the fundamentals in common With such different yet harmonious outward manifestations of those fundamentals surely the result will not be unworthy of poetry or music and will surely be of infinite value to the dance in its reinstatement among the arts  We so often fail to say the pleasant things we think POETRY is a monthly refreshment It is like a breath from freshly opened flowers or a drink of mountain water  Bertha Wardell Los Angeles Cal  Note by the Editor Another correspondent reminds us that Rupert Hughes well known both as novelist and composer has used a number of modern lyrics for example one of the
