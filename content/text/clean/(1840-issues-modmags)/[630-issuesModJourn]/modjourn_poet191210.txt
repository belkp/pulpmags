OCTOBER 1912   POETRY   IT is a little isle amid bleak seas   An isolate realm of garden circled round   By importunity of stress and sound   Devoid of empery to master these   At most the memory of its streamsand bees Borne to the toiling mariner outward bound Recalls his soul to that delightful ground But serves no beacon toward his destinies   It is a refuge from the stormy days Breathing the peace of a remoter world Where beauty like the musing dusk of even Enfolds the spirit in its silver haze While far away with glittering banners furled The west lights fade and stars come out in heaven POETRY A Magazine of Verse   It is a sea gate trembling with the blast Of powers that from the infinite sea plain roll A whelming tide Upon the waiting soul As on a fronting rock thunders the vast Groundswell its spray bursts heavenward and drives past In fume and sound articulate of the whole Of ocean s heart else voiceless on the shoal Silent upon the headland clear at last   From darkened sea coasts without stars or sun Like trumpet voices in a holy war Utter the heralds tidings of the deep And where men slumber weary and undone Visions shall come incredible hopes from far And with high passion shatter the bonds of sleep   Arthur Davison Ficke I AM THE WOMAN   I am the Woman ark of the law and its breaker Who chastened her steps and taught her knees to be meek Bridled and bitted her heart and humbled her cheek Parcelled her will and cried Take more to the taker Shunned what they told her to shun sought what they   bade her seek Locked up her mouth from scornful speaking now it is open to speak   I am she that is terribly fashioned the creature Wrought in God s perilous mood in His unsafe hour The morning star was mute beholding my feature Seeing the rapture I was the shame and the power Scared at my manifold meaning he heard me call O fairest among ten thousand acceptable brother And he answered not for doubt till he saw me crawl And whisper down to the secret worm O mother Be not wroth in the ancient house thy daughter forgets   not at all I am the Woman fleer away Soft withdrawer back from the maddened mate Lurer inward and down to the gates of day And crier there in the gate What shall I give for thee wild one say The long slow rapture and patient anguish of life Or art thou minded a swifter way Ask if thou canst the gold but oh if thou must POETRY A Magazine of Verse   Good is the shining dross lovely the dust Look at me I am the Woman harlot and heavenly wife Tell me thy price be unashamed I will assuredly pay   I am also the Mother of two that I bore I comfort and feed the slayer feed and comfort the slain Did they number my daughters and sons I am mother   of more Many a head they marked not here in my bosom has lain Babbling with unborn lips in a tongue to be Far incredible matters all familiar to me Still would the man come whispering Wife but many   a time my breast Took him not as a husband I soothed him and laid him   to rest Even as the babe of my body and knew him for such My mouth is open to speak that was dumb too much I say to you I am the Mother and under the sword Which flamed each way to harry us forth from the Lord I saw Him young at the portal weeping and staying the   rod And I even I was His mother and I yearned as the mother of God   I am also the Spirit The Sisters laughed When I sat with them dumb in the portals over my lamp Half asleep in the doors for my gown was raught m the Woman   Off at the shoulder to shield from the wind and the rain The wick I tended against the mysterious hour When the Silent City of Being should ring with song As the Lord came in with Life to the marriage bower Look laughed the elder Sisters and crimson with   shame I hid my breast away from the rosy flame Ah cried the leaning Sisters pointing doing me   wrong Do you see laughed the wanton Sisters She will   get her lover ere long And it was but a little while till unto my need He was given indeed And we walked where waxing world after world went by And I said to my lover Let us begone Oh let us begone and try Which of them all the fairest to dwell in is Which is the place for us our desirable clime But he said They are only the huts and the little   villages Pleasant to go and lodge in rudely over the vintage time Scornfully spake he being unwise Being flushed at heart because of our walking together But I was mute with passionate prophecies My heart went veiled and faint in the golden weather While universe drifted by after still universe Then I cried Alas we must hasten and lodge therein One after one and in every star that they shed POETRY A Magazine of Verse   A dark and a weary thing is come on our head To search obedience out in the bosom of sin To listen deep for love when thunders the curse For O my love behold where the Lord hath planted In every star in the midst His dangerous Tree Still I must pluck thereof and bring unto thee Saying The coolness for which all night we have panted Taste of the goodly thing I have tasted first Bringing us noway coolness but burning thirst Giving us noway peace but implacable strife Loosing upon us the wounding joy and the wasting   sorrow of life   I am the Woman ark of the Law and sacred arm to upbear it Heathen trumpet to overthrow and idolatrous sword to shear it Yea she whose arm was round the neck of the morning star at song Is she who kneeleth now in the dust and cries at the secret door Open to me O sleeping mother The gate is heavy and strong Open to me I am come at last be wroth with thy child no more Let me lie down with thee there in the dark and be slothful with thee as before   William Vaughan Moody TO WHISTLER AMERICAN   On the loan exhibit of his paintings at the Tate Gallery   You also our first great Had tried all ways Tested and pried and worked in many fashions And this much gives me heart to play the game   Here is a part that s slight and part gone wrong And much of little moment and some few Perfect as Durer   In the Studio and these two portraits if I had my choice And then these sketches in the mood of Greece   You had your searches your uncertainties And this is good to know for us I mean Who bear the brunt of our America And try to wrench her impulse into art   You were not always sure not always set To hiding night or tuning symphonies Had not one style from birth but tried and pried And stretched and tampered with the media   You and Abe Lincoln from that mass of dolts Show us there s chance at least of winning through   Ezra Pound   Brown and Gold de Race Grenat et Or Le Petit Cardinal POETRY A Magazine of Verse   MIDDLE AGED   A STUDY IN AN EMOTION   Tis but a vague invarious delight As gold that rains about some buried king   As the fine flakes When tourists frolicking Stamp on his roof or in the glazing light Try photographs wolf down their ale and cakes And start to inspect some further pyramid   As the fine dust in the hid cell beneath Their transitory step and merriment Drifts through the air and the sarcophagus Gains yet another crust Of useless riches for the occupant So I the fires that lit once dreams Now over and spent Lie dead within four walls And so now love Rains down and so enriches some stiff case And strews a mind with precious metaphors   And so the space Of my still consciousness Is full of gilded snow   The which no cat has eyes enough To see the brightness of Ezra Pound FISH OF THE FLOOD   Fish of the flood on the banked billow Thou layest thy head in dreams Sliding as slides thy shifting pillow One with the streams Of the sea is thy spirit   Gean tree thou spreadest thy foaming flourish Abroad in the sky so grey It not heeding if it thee nourish Thou dost obey Happy its moving   So God thy love it not needeth me Only thy life that I blessed be   Emilia Stuart Lorimer POETRY A Magazine of Verse   TO ONE UNKNOWN   I have seen the proudest stars That wander on through space Even the sun and moon But not your face   I have heard the violin The winds and waves rejoice In endless minstrelsy Yet not your voice   I have touched the trillium Pale flower of the land Coral anemone And not your hand   I have kissed the shining feet Of Twilight lover wise Opened the gates of Dawn Oh not your eyes   1 have dreamed unwonted things Visions that witches brew Spoken with images Never with you   Helen Dudley SYMPHONY OF A MEXICAN GARDEN   1 THE GARDEN Poco sostenuto in A major   The laving tide of inarticulate air   Vivace in A major   The iris people dance   2 THE POOL Allegretto in A minor   Cool hearted dim familiar of the doves   3 THE BIRDS Presto in F major   I keep a frequent tryst   Presto meno assai   The blossom powdered orange tree   4 TO THE MOON Allegro con brio in A major   Moon that shone on Babylon   TO MOZART   What junipers are these inlaid With flame of the pomegranate tree The god of gardens must have made This still unrumored place for thee To rest from immortality And dream within the splendid shade Some more elusive symphony Than orchestra has ever played POETRY A Magazine of Verse   In A major   Poco sostenuto   The laving tide of inarticulate air Breaks here in flowers as the sea in foam But with no satin lisp of failing wave The odor laden winds are very still An unimagined music here exhales In upcurled petal dreamy bud half furled And variations of thin vivid leaf Symphonic beauty that some god forgot If form could waken into lyric sound This flock of irises like poising birds Would feel song at their slender feathered throats And pour into a grey winged aria Their wrinkled silver fingermarked with pearl That flight of ivory roses high along The airy azure of the larkspur spires Would be a fugue to puzzle nightingales With too evasive rapture phrase on phrase Where the hibiscus flares would cymbals clash And the black cypress like a deep bassoon Would hum a clouded amber melody   But all across the trudging ragged chords   That are the tangled grasses in the heat   The mariposa lilies fluttering   Like trills upon some archangelic flute Symphony of a Mexican Garden   The roses and carnations and divine Small violets that voice the vanished god There is a lure of passion poignant tone Not flower of pomegranate that finds the heart As stubborn oboes do can breathe in air Nor poppies nor keen lime nor orange bloom   What zone of wonder in the ardent dusk Of trees that yearn and cannot understand Vibrates as to the golden shepherd horn That stirs some great adagio with its cry And will not let it rest   O tender trees Your orchid like a shepherdess of dreams Calls home her whitest dream from following Elusive laughter of the unmindful god   Vivace   The iris people dance Like any nimble faun To rhythmic radiance They foot it in the dawn They dance and have no need Of crystal dripping flute Or chuckling river reed Their music hovers mute The dawn lights flutter by All noiseless but they know POETRY A Magazine of Verse   Such children of the sky Can hear the darkness go But does the morning play Whatever they demand Or amber barred bourrée Or silver saraband   THE POOL   II In A minor   Allegretto   Cool hearted dim familiar of the doves Thou coiled sweet water where they come to tell Their mellow legends and rehearse their loves As what in April or in June befell And thou must hear of friend of Dryades Who lean to see where flower should be set To star the dusk of wreathed ivy braids They have not left thy trees Nor do tired fauns thy crystal kiss forget Nor forest nymphs astray from distant glades   Thou feelest with delight their showery feet   Along thy mossy margin myrtle starred And thine the heart of wildness quick to beat At imprint of shy hoof upon thy sward Symphony of a Mexican Garden   Yet who could know thee wild who art so cool So heavenly minded templed in thy grove Of plumy cedar larch and juniper O strange ecstatic Pool What unknown country art thou dreaming of Or temple than this garden lovelier   Who made thy sky the silver side of leaves And poised its orchid like a swan white moon Whose disc of perfect pallor half deceives The mirror of thy limpid green lagoon He loveth well thy ripple feathered moods Thy whims at dusk thy rainbow look at dawn Dream thou no more of vales Olympian   Where pale Olympus broods There were no orchid white as moon or swan No sky of leaves no garden haunting Pan   THE BIRDS   III In F major   Presto   I keep a frequent tryst With whirr and shower of wings Some inward melodist Interpreting all things Appoints the place the hours POETRY A Magazine of Verse   Dazzle and sense of flowers   Though not the least leaf stir   May mean a tanager   How rich the silence is until he sings   The smoke tree s cloudy white Has fire within its breast What winged mere delight There hides as in a nest And fashions of its flame Music without a name So might an opal sing If given thrilling wing And voice for lyric wildness unexpressed   In grassy dimness thatched With tangled growing things A troubadour rose patched With velvet shadowed wings Seeks a sustaining fly Who else unseen goes by Quick pattering through the hush Some twilight footed thrush Or finch intent on small adventurings   I have no time for gloom   For gloom what time have I   The orange is in bloom   Emerald parrots fly Symphony of a Mexican Garden   Out of the cypress dusk Morning is strange with musk The wild canary now Jewels the lemon bough And mocking birds laugh in the rose s room   THE ORANGE TREE   In D Major   Presto meno assai   The blossom powdered orange tree For all her royal speechlessness Out of a heart of ecstasy Is singing singing none the less   Light as a springing fountain she Is spray above the wind sleek turf Dream daughter of the moon s white sea And sister to its showered surf   TO THE MOON   IV In A major   Allegro con brio   Moon that shone on Babylon Searching out the gardens there Could you find a fairer one Than this garden anywhere Did Damascus at her best Hide such beauty in her breast POETRY A Magazine of Verse   When you flood with creamy light Vines that net the sombre pine Turn the shadowed iris white Summon cactus stars to shine Do you free in silvered air Wistful spirits everywhere   Here they linger there they pass And forget their native heaven Flit along the dewy grass Rare Vittoria Sappho even And the hushed magnolia burns Incense in her gleaming urns   When the nightingale demands Word with Keats who answers him Shakespeare listens understands Mindful of the cherubim And the South Wind dreads to know Mozart gone as seraphs go   Moon of poets dead and gone Moon to gods of music dear Gardens they have looked upon Let them re discover here Rest and dream a little space Of some heart remembered place   Grace Hazard Conkling    EDITORIAL COMMENT   AS IT WAS   ONCE upon a time when man was new in the   woods of the world when his feet were   scarred with jungle thorns and his hands   were red with the blood of beasts a great   king rose who gathered his neighbors together and subdued the wandering tribes Strange cunning was his for he ground the stones to an edge together and bound them with thongs to sticks and he taught his people to pry apart the forest and beat back the ravenous beasts And he bade them honeycomb the mountainside with caves to dwell therein with their women And the most beautiful women the king took for his own that his wisdom might not perish from the earth And he led the young men to war and conquered all the warring tribes from the mountains to the sea And when fire smote a great tree out of heaven and raged through the forest till the third sun he seized a burning brand and lit an altar to his god And there beside the ever burning fire he sat and made laws and did justice And his people loved and feared him   And the king grew old And for seven journeys of the sun from morn to morn he moved not neither uttered word And the hearts of the people were troubled but none dared speak to the king s despair neither wise men nor warriors dared cry out unto him POETRY A Magazine of Verse   Now the youngest son of the king was a lad still soft of flesh who had never run to battle not sat in council nor stood before the king And his heart yearned for his father and he bowed before his mother and said Give me thy blessing for I have words within me for the king yea as the sea sings to the night with waves will my words roll in singing unto his grief And his mother said Go my son for thou hast words of power and soothing and the king shall be healed   So the youth went forth and bowed him toward the king s seat And the wise men and warriors laid hands upon him and said Who art thou that thou shouldst go in ahead of us to him who sitteth in darkness And the king s son rose and stretched forth his arms and said Unhand me and let me go ye silent ones who for seven sun journeys have watched in darkness and uttered no word of light Unhand me for as a fig tree with fruit so my heart is rich with words for the king   Then he put forth his strength and strode on singing softly and bowed him before the king And he spake the king s great deeds in cunning words his wars and city carvings and wise laws his dominion over men and beasts and the thick woods of the earth his greeting of the gods with fire   And lo the king lifted up his head and stretched forth his arms and wept Yea all these things have I done he said and they shall perish with me My death is upon me and I shall die and the tribes I have welded As It Was   together shall be broken apart and the beasts shall win back their domain and the green jungle shall overgrow my mansions Lo the fire shall go out on the altar of the gods and my glory shall be as a crimson cloud that the night swallows up in darkness   Then the young man lifted up his voice and cried Oh king be comforted Thy deeds shall not pass as a cloud neither shall thy laws be strewn before the wind For I will carve thy glory in rich and rounded words yea I will string thy deeds together in jewelled beads of perfect words that thy sons shall wear on their hearts forever   Verily thy words are rich with song said the king but thou shalt die and who will utter them Like twinkling foam is the speech of man s mouth like foam from a curling wave that vanishes in the sun   Nay let thy heart believe me oh king my father said the youth For the words of my mouth shall keep step with the ripple of waves and the beating of wings yea they shall mount with the huge paces of the sun in heaven that cease not for my ceasing Men shall sound them on suckling tongues still soft with milk they shall run into battle to the tune of thy deeds and kindle their fire with the breath of thy wisdom And thy glory shall be ever living as a jewel of jasper from the earth yea as the green jewel of jasper carven into a god for the rod of thy power oh king and of the power of thy sons forever POETRY A Magazine of Verse   The king sat silent till the going down of the sun Then lifted he his head and stroked his beard and spake Verily the sun goes down and my beard shines whiter than his and I shall die Now therefore stand at my right hand O son of my wise years child of my dreams Stand at my right hand and fit thy speech to music that men may hold in their hearts thy rounded words Forever shalt thou keep thy place and utter thy true tale in the ears of the race And woe be unto them that hear thee not Verily that generation shall pass as a cloud and its glory shall be as a tree that withers For thou alone shalt win the flying hours to thee and keep the beauty of them for the joy of men forever   H M   ON THE READING OF POETRY   In the brilliant pages of his essay on Jean François Millet Romain Rolland says that Millet as a boy used to read the Bucolics and the Georgics with enchantment and was seized by emotion when he came to the line It is the hour when the great shadows seek the plain   Et jam summa procul villarum culmina fumant Majoresque cadunt altis de montibus umbrae   To the lover and student of poetry this incident has an especial charm and significance There is something fine in the quick sympathy of an artist in one kind for On the Reading of Poetry   beauty expressed by the master of another medium The glimpse M Rolland gives us of one of the most passionate art students the world has ever known implies with fresh grace a truth Anglo Saxons are always forgetting that poetry is one of the great humanities that poetry is one of the great arts of expression   Many of our customs conspire to cause almost to force this forgetting Thousands of us have been educated to a dark and often permanent ignorance of classic poetry by being taught in childhood to regard it as written for the purpose of illustrating Hadley s Latin or Goodwin s Greek grammar and composed to follow the rules of versification at the end of the book It seems indeed one of fate s strangest ironies that the efforts of these distinguished grammarians to unveil immortal masterpieces are commonly used in schools and colleges to enshroud not to say swaddle up the images of the gods forever young and turn them into mummies In our own country far from perceiving in Vergil s quiet music the magnificent gesture of nature that thrilled his Norman reader far from conceiving of epic poetry as the simplest universal tongue one early acquires a wary distrust of it as something one must constantly labor over   Aside from gaining in childhood this strong practical objection to famous poetry people achieve the deadly habit of reading metrical lines unimaginatively After forming generally in preparation for entering one POETRY A Magazine of Verse   of our great universities the habit of blinding the inner eye deafening the inner ear and dropping into a species of mental coma before a page of short lines it is difficult for educated persons to read poetry with what is known as ordinary human intelligence   It does not occur to them simply to listen to the nightingale But poetry I believe never speaks her beauty certainly never her scope and variety except on the condition that in her presence one sits down quietly with folded hands and truly listens to her singing voice   So for one the wet sail arching through the rainbow round the bow And for one the creak of snow shoes on the crust   Many people do not like poetry in this way as a living art to be enjoyed but rather as an exact science to be approved To them poetry may concern herself only with a limited number of subjects to be presented in a predetermined and conventional manner and form To such readers the word form means usually only a repeated literary effect and they do not understand that every form was in its first and best use an originality employed not for the purpose of following any rule but because it said truly what the artist wished to express I suppose much of the monotony of subject and treatment observable in modern verse is due to this belief that poetry is merely a fixed way of repeating certain meritorious though highly familiar concepts of existence and not in the least the infinite music of words meant to speak the little and the great tongues of the earth On the Reading of Poetry   It is exhilarating to read the pages of Pope and of Byron whether you agree with them or not because here poetry does speak the little and the great tongues of the earth and sings satires pastorals and lampoons literary and dramatic criticism all manner of fun and sparkling prettiness sweeping judgments nice discriminations fashions politics the ways of gentle and simple love and desire and pain and sorrow and anguish and death   The impulse which inspired and the appreciation which endowed this magazine has been a generous sympathy with poetry as an art The existence of a gallery for poems and verse has an especially attractive social value in its power of recalling or creating the beautiful and clarifying pleasure of truly reading poetry in its broad scope and rich variety The hospitality of this hall will have been a genuine source of happiness if somehow it tells the visitors either while they are here or after they have gone to other places what a delight it is to enjoy a poem to realize it to live in the vivid dream it evokes to hark to its music to listen to the special magic grace of its own style and composition and to know that this special grace will say as deeply as some revealing hour with a friend one loves something nothing else can say something which is life itself sung in free sympathy beyond the bars of time and space   E W POETRY A Magazine of Verse   THE MOTIVE OF THE MAGAZINE   In the huge democracy of our age no interest is too slight to have an organ Every sport every little industry requires its own corner its own voice that it may find its friends greet them welcome them   The arts especially have need of each an entrenched place a voice of power if they are to do their work and be heard For as the world grows greater day by day as every member of it through something he buys or knows or loves reaches out to the ends of the earth things precious to the race things rare and delicate may be overpowered lost in the criss cross of modern currents the confusion of modern immensities   Painting sculpture music are housed in palaces in the great cities of the world and every week or two a new periodical is born to speak for one or the other of them and tenderly nursed at some guardian s expense Architecture responding to commercial and social demands is whipped into shape by the rough and tumble of life and fostered willy nilly by men s material needs Poetry alone of all the fine arts has been left to shift for herself in a world unaware of its immediate and desperate need of her a world whose great deeds whose triumphs over matter over the wilderness over racial enmities and distances require her ever living voice to give them glory and glamour The Motive of the Magazine   Poetry has been left to herself and blamed for inefficiency a process as unreasonable as blaming the desert for barrenness This art like every other is not a miracle of direct creation but a reciprocal relation between the artist and his public The people must do their part if the poet is to tell their story to the future they must cultivate and irrigate the soil if the desert is to blossom as the rose   The present venture is a modest effort to give to poetry her own place her own voice The popular magazines can afford her but scant courtesy a Cinderella corner in the ashes because they seek a large public which is not hers a public which buys them not for their verse but for their stories pictures journalism rarely for their literature even in prose Most magazine editors say that there is no public for poetry in America one of them wrote to a young poet that the verse his monthly accepted must appeal to the barber s wife of the Middle West and others prove their distrust by printing less verse from year to year and that rarely beyond page end length and importance   We believe that there is a public for poetry that it will grow and that as it becomes more numerous and appreciative the work produced in this art will grow in power in beauty in significance In this belief we have been encouraged by the generous enthusiasm of many subscribers to our fund by the sympathy of other lovers of the art and by the quick response of many prominent POETRY A Magazine of Verse   poets both American and English who have sent or promised contributions   We hope to publish in Poetry some of the best work now being done in English verse Within space limitations set at present by the small size of our monthly sheaf we shall be able to print poems longer and of more intimate and serious character than the popular magazines can afford to use The test limited by ever fallible human judgment is to be quality alone all forms whether narrative dramatic or lyric will be acceptable We hope to offer our subscribers a place of refuge a green isle in the sea where Beauty may plant her gardens and Truth austere revealer of joy and sorrow of hidden delights and despairs may follow her brave quest unafraid NOTES AND ANNOUNCEMENTS   In order that the experiment of a magazine of verse may have a fair trial over one hundred subscriptions of fifty dollars annually for five years have been promised by the ladies and gentlemen listed below In addition

through the courtesy of the Houghton Mifflin Co to offer our readers a poem hitherto unprinted from advance sheets of the complete works of the late William Vaughan Moody which will be published in November The lamentable Notes and Announcements   death of this poet two years ago in the early prime of his great powers was a calamity to literature It is fitting that the first number of a magazine published in the city where for years he wrote and taught should contain an important poem from his hand   Mr Ezra Pound the young Philadelphia poet whose recent distinguished success in London led to wide recognition in his own country authorizes the statement that at present such of his poetic work as receives magazine publication in America will appear exclusively in Poetry Tha t discriminating London publisher Mr Elkin Mathews discovered this young poet from over seas and published Personae Exultations and Canzoniere three small volumes of verse from which a selection has been reprinted by the Houghton Mifflin Co under the title Provença Mr Pound s latest work is a translation from the Italian of Sonnets and Ballate by Guido Cavalcanti   Mr Arthur Davison Ficke another contributor is a graduate of Harvard who studied law and entered his father s office in Davenport Iowa He is the author of The Happy Princess and The Breaking of Bonds and a contributor to leading magazines An early number of Poetry will be devoted exclusively to Mr Ficke s work   Mrs Roscoe P Conkling is a resident of the state of New York a young poet who has contributed to various magazines POETRY A Magazine of Verse   Miss Lorimer is a young English poet resident in Oxford who will publish her first volume this autumn The London Poetry Review in its August number introduced her with a group of lyrics which were criticized with some asperity in the New Age and praised with equal warmth in other periodicals   J   Miss Dudley who is a Chicagoan born and bred is still younger in the art To One Unknown being the first of her poems to be printed   Poetry will acknowledge the receipt of books of verse and works relating to the subject and will print brief reviews of those which seem for any reason significant It will endeavor also to keep its readers informed of the progress of the art throughout the English speaking world and continental Europe The American metropolitan newspaper prints cable dispatches about postimpressionists futurists secessionists and other radicals in painting sculpture and music but so far as its editors and readers are concerned French poetry might have died with Victor Hugo and English with Tennyson or at most Swinburne   NOTE Eight months after the first general newspaper announcement of our efforts to secure a fund for a magazine of verse and three or four months after our first use of the title Poetry a Boston firm of publishers announced a forthcoming periodical of the same kind to be issued under the same name The two are not to be confused   THE
