The Problem oi the Railroads is the result of a series of conferences with President W.C. Brown of the New York Central Railroad, President E. P.

It presents this subject of national importance from the intimate view point of t he men who run the roads, and is calculated lo interest every thoughtful person. The Mysterious North Star by Garrett P. Serviss, the eminent astronomer, is an article of unusual in- terest which discloses many hitherto unknown facts about this extraordinary planet. The Pinkertons, the Police, and the Crooks by O'Connor Douglas, is an article from material furnished the author by a reformed confidence man who has operated in this country and Europe for over thirty years and who writes of startling conditions little known to the general public.

By new and enlightened methods of teaching and scientific training, back- ward children are led, step by step, into a more or less clear comprehension of flicm selves and their possibilities. Their mental and physical characteristics are studied and shaped toward a definite end. No home, no matter how luxurious, coutd offer the same opportunities, phys- ical and mental, as are provided for the development and happiness of such children at the Bancroft Training School HADDONFIELD, N. J. The location is on an estate of 18 acres of park land, thus insuring healthful out- door life with entire privacy. Walks, drives, and occasional excursions make up an im- portant part of the daily life of the school. The building is modern ill all its appoint- ments, and the facilities of the school having been recently enlarged, there are now vacancies for a very limited number of new pupils. The course fin brace s the English branches, plain sewing and fancy needle- work, woodwork and carving, free hand drawing, painting, music and dancing. A kindly personal intere.it is taken in each pupil. A Home Correspondence Course for ihose whose circumstances make nec- essary the care of their children at home, puts within the reach of such the most scientific methods of training backward children. The course is adapted to the spe- cial needs of each child. Teachers Correspondence Course Affords teachers an opportunity to add to their knowledge of the education of normal children a special knowledge in the teaching of subnormal cases Parents or guardians having backward children in their charge can get particulars of the work of resident pupils or the cor- respondence course by writing to MARGARET BANCROFT, Principal, I .  . .

M AG AZ INE NOTES In the Mart h number Mr. Roosevelt will de- scribe a notably picturesque journey,  Trekking Through the Thirst to the Sotik. In the be ginning of this article he again refers to v isits paid to the missionaries; the Frenc h Catholic Missi on and the American Industrial Mission, condiii ted by Mr. Ilurlburt, who had visited the author at the W hite House. He says it was always good lo see the settlers and missionaries working together, and he believes that treating the black man well will materially help in mak- ing Hast Africa a white man's country. Contrary to perhaps what is a very general belief, in this part of Africa, notably at Kijabe, almost under the equator, the scenery is almost northern in type, and at night comfort was found before blazing camp-fires, while the days were as cool as September. The des  ription of his large caravan, which tor the trek across " 1 he I hirst was augmented by the addition of four ox- wagons. gives a graphic impression of the va- ried human elements that helped to make the journey possible. Much of the way was trav- ersed alter dark under a brilliant moon, and there are some very fine passages about the slow moving procession as ii journeyed on through "the shimmering moonlighf'of the African night, while herds o  zebra and hartebeesl gazed at llit-n 1 as they passed. One ot the exciting ex- periences was a i harge on the c aravan by a c ow rhino with her   all". There are many hunting in i idenls. and an interesting account of a visit to a Kraal of the Musa is. whose chief business is the tending of their iloi and herds, but who are always formidable warriors. It has been remarked by many that few writers and few sportsmen indeed have so widely varied an outlook as Mr. Roosevelt. He is keenly alive to every contrast, every change in scene and c ondition of life, and his enthusiasm and unflagging interest and surprising knowl- edge give eai h additional   hapter of his narrative new value. The author s unfailingly attractive personality pervades them all. and few readers can resist its appeal. He is attracted and finds interest in a hundred little iiu idents and observ a- tions that would escape a less sympathetic trav - eler. The illustration above shows the method bv which many ot ihe animals are photographed by Kermit Roosevelt. MAGAZINE NOTES The portrait of Frederic Remington that was printed in these notes for January, with the an- nouncement of Mr. Cprtissoz s article, was an excellent likeness of him, and to his friends it well suggested his splendid physical equipment and the fine spirit and directness of his mind. The article had been written'and was actually on the press before the illness which caused his un- timely death and removed a strong and always very individual painter of typically American sub jects; a man whose force, enthusiasm, and knowl edge were unequalled in his chosen field. Only recently Mr. Remington exhibited a collection of his paintings in New York a number of them accompany Mr. Cortissoz s article and they at- tracted the widest attention and interest. Rarely does an artist so live in his work as did Mr. Remington; it was the outcome of his own ex- periences, the graphic record of actual contact in his early days with a people and a country that have already almost become traditions to the present generation. Those who were fortunate enough to know the man valued his friendship and enjoyed his vigorous personality, uncom- promising sincerity, and outspokenness. Tt will very soon be garden time again in the North and already many are thinking of the spring planting, of beds and borders, of tlowers and shrubs, and the little paths that make a gar- den a pleasant place to wander and take one s ease in. One of the most beautiful gardens any- where is out in Long Island, New York, designed and selected by Mrs. Helena Rutherfurd Ely, the author of  A Woman s Hardy Garden   and an acknowledged authority, who will contribute an article to the March number on "The Color Arrangements of Flowers.  Garden making is an art, and in the selection of colors and their harmonious combination the skilful gardener should look upon the work very much as a painter might in setting his palette for a picture. Mrs. Ely writes with a full knowledge of the thoroughly practical side of gardening, and her suggestions regarding choice of plants, the best time for planting and transplanting, the use of fertilizers and other problems that confront the garden worker in the spring will be found of great value. The borders of a garden add a charm that catches the eye and pleases the senses when they show fitness in selection. Here are given the plants for a white border, one of the author s greatest pleasures,  exquisite at night as well as in the daytime,  a pink border, a blue border, rare among borders, a red border, with many old fashioned favorites, hollyhocks, scarlet lych- nis among them. The ideal garden is   a place where one may walk or talk, read or work, quite unobserved, with the sunshine all around, yet seated in cool shade, the murmuring of falling water, together with the exquisite notes of the song sparrow, or the liquid call of the cat-bird in their ears.  The illustrations will be unusually beautiful, made directly by the new process of color pho- tography. from the plants in Mrs. Ely s garden. V V Few musicians were better known, and few had such interesting associations with so many famous people as Richard Hoffman, the pianist, teacher, and composer, who died during the last year after half a century's residence in New York, though he was by birth an Englishman. Many readers will hear with special pleasure of the forthcoming publication in the Magazine of two papers of reminiscences left by Mr. Hoff- man, giving  Some Musical Recollections of Fifty Years.  One of his earliest recollections is of a visit made lo Birmingham to hear the first performance of  Elijah.  conducted by the composer, Felix Mendelssohn. It was a mem- orable journey for a boy of fourteen to take alone, and the impression made upon him  was never to be forgotten.  The sensation produced by the last chorus of the first part of the  Elijah,   Thanks be to God,  was truly wonderful. One felt as if the Divine Presence had been evoked, so impressive, so awe-inspiring was its effect upon the listeners. Another great event in the young musician s early life was hearing Liszt, then a young man of twenty-eight. The account of the au- thor s own first appearance at The Tabernacle, Broadway and Leonard Street, New York, and of his subsequent concert tour, gives a delightfully intimate view of the difficulties, vicissitudes, and real hardships that attended the career of a young and ambitious musician in the days of primitive travel in this country. In another number Mr. Hoffman will describe the first appearance of Jenny Lind at Castle Garden, and his experi- ences with her company of which he became a member. V V  rhat a man may be both a prophet and a seer and not come into his own until he is forgotten is by no means an unusual happening. The in- terpreter sometimes becomes greater than the creator, for a moment, at least, and only time and the changing public taste can justify the truth. In her new story,  The Legend,  in the series called  Tales of Men,  Mrs. Wharton has invented a situation of absorbing interest. It is a story of the literary world, of the influence of an original and unusual mind, with a note of amusing satire.    nc of the author s stories sure to be much talked about, and sure to add to her artistic reputaiion.

They had made paths hither and thither across the swamp, these paths being three feet deep in ooze and black water. There were little islands in the swamp on whi  h they could rest. Toward its lower end, where it ran into the Nairobi, the Kamiti emerged from the papyrus swamp and became a rapid brown stream of water with only here and there a papyrus cluster along its banks. The  Nairobi, which cut across the lower end of the farm, and the Rewero, which bounded it on the other side from the Ka- miti. were as different as possible from the latter. Both were rapid streams broken, by riffle and waterfall, and running at the bottom of tree-i lad valleys. The Xairobi Falls, which were on Heatlev s Ranch, were singularly beautiful.

From Tuja Farm we marched a dozen miles and pitched our tent close beside the Kamiti. The Kamiti is a queer little stream, run- ning for most of its course through a broad swamp of tall papyrus. Such a swamp is almost impenetrable. The papyrus grows to a height of over twenty feet, and the stems are so close together that in most places it is impossible to see anything at a distance of six feet. Ten ya rds from the edge, when with- in the swamp, I was wholly unable to tell in which direction the open ground lay, and could get out only by either following my back track or listening for voices.

These are not as high as the falls of the Nairobi, but they are almost as beautiful. We clambered down into the ravinea lit- tle distance below and made our way toward them, beside the brawl- ing, rock-choked torrent. Great trees towered over- head, and among their lops the monkeys chut- tered and screeched. The fall itself was broker, in two parts like a miniature Niagara, and the spray urtain shifted to and fro as the wind blew.

As the sun set behind us, the long lights changed the look of the country and gave it a beauty that had in it an element of the mysterious and the unreal. The mountains loomed both largerand more vague than they had been in the bright sun- light, and the plains lost their look of parched desolation as the afterglow came and went. We were galloping through a world of dim shade and dving color; and, in this world, our horses suddenly halted on the brink of a deep ravine from out of which came the thunder of a cataract. We reined up on a jutting point. The snowy masses of the fall foamed over a ledge on our right, and below at our feet vvasa great pool of swirling water. Thick foliaged trees, of strange shape and festooned with creepers, climbed the sheer sidesof the ravine.

But the most interesting birds we saw were the blat k whv- dah lini lies. The female is a dull-colored, African Game Trails ordinary looking bird. somewhat like a fe- male bobolink. I lic male in liis     nrt .lii   dress is   lad in a uniform dark glossv suit, and liis tail-feathers a ri: almost li kf some    1 those   1 a I  arnvan I r   ostcr, I icingi ver t   i  c as h mg as the rest   il the I  ird. with a down- ward i urve .it the ti  is. I he females were generally found in flocks, in   hi  h there would otten Ite a goodly number   'I males also, and when the docks   ut on I the males tended to drop behind. The flocks were feeding in Hcatlcv's grain-fields, and he was threatening vengeance upon them. 1 was sorry, for the male Ilirds   ertainlv have habits of peculiar interest. They were not shy, although if we approached too near them in their favorite haunts, the grassland adjoining the papyrus beds, tliev would llv off and pen h on the tops of the papyrus stems. I'lie long tail hampers the bird in its flight, and it i-- often held at rather an angle downward, giving the bird ,i pe  uliar and almost insect like appearance Hut the marked and extraordinary pe  uliarity was the i ustom the cocks had of dancing in arti- ficially made dancing rings, kora mile and a half beyond our camp, down the   ourse of the Kamiti, the grassland at the edge of the papvrus was llii  klv strewn with these dan- cing-rings. Kach was about two feet in di- ameter. sometimes more, sometimes less. A tuft of growing grass perhaps a foot high was left in the centre. Over the rest of the 1 Ilc y I:. . rn. h ,, 11   ' i   O  I l,i.

As there were many scores of these dam ing-places within a comparatively lim- ited territory, the effect was rather striking when a large number of birds wen.' dan- cing at the same lime. As one walked along, the impression conveyed by the birds continually popping above the grass and then immediately sinking back, was somewhat as if a man was making peas I ; I ,  I ri  .in   ..mic jl l H , in ,1 'in II I;.

We walked near the edge of theswamp. The n hydah birds were continually I il il ling up and  b wn in front of us as they rose and fell on their dancing- places, while the kavi- r"t:d" . ranes i tiled mournfully all around. Before we ha l gone two miles, buffalo were spied, we I ahead, feeding close t   the papyrus. The line of the papyrus w hich marked the edge of the swamp was not straight, but with projections and indenta- tions. and by fullowing it closely ; nd  'tit- ling i autiotisK a. toss tlie puints. the oppor- tunity lor stalking was good.

Cautiously threading our way along the edge of the swamp, 've got within ;i hundred and fifty yards of the bulfalo helore we w ere perceived. There w ere four I mils, grazing . lose Iiv the edge of the swamp, their black bodies glistening in the early sun-rays, their massive horns showing w hitc. and the cow herons perched on their backs. I hey stared sullenly at u  with 1 mtstretched heads lrom under their itreat frontlets ot horn. The biggest of the tour stood a little out from the other three, and at him 1 fired, the bullet telling with a smai L on the tough hide and going through the lungs. We h.id been afraid they would at once turn into the papyrus, but instead of this they started straight across our front directly lor the open country This was a piece of huge- good luck. Kermit put his first barrel irt   the second bull, and 1 my second barrel into one of the others, after which it became impossible to say whit h bullet struck whit h animal, as the firing became general. They ran a quarter of a mile into the open, and then the big bull 1 had first shot, and whk h had no other bullet in him. dropped der.d, while the other three, all of whi  h were wounded, halted beside him. We walked toward them, rather expecting a c barge: hut when w e were still over tw o hundred vards away they started l a  k for the swamp, and we began firing. The distance being long. I used my Winchester. Aiming well be- fore one bull, he dropped to the shot a.s if IHileaxed. falling straight on his bat k with his legs kicking; but in a moment he was up again and after the others. Later I found that the bullet, a full metal patch, had struck him in the head but did not pene- trate to the brain, and merely stunned him lor tlit moment. All the time we ke  t iuii- ning diagonally to their line  if flight. T1 ey were all three badlywounded, and when they reached the tall rark grass, high as a mai s head, whic h fringed the   lapyrus sw amp. the two foremost lay down, w hile the last one, the one I had lloorcd with the Winchester, turned, and with nose outstretched began to cunie toward us. I le was badlv crippled, however, and with a soft nosed bullet fmm my heavy Holland 1 knot keel him down, i his time b  r g  iod. The   it her two then r  ise, anti though eat h was again hit thev readied the swam i. one of them to our right, the other to the left where the papyrus came out in a pi lint. W e decided to go after the latter, and, ad- vant ing very cautiously toward the edge cif the swamp, put in the three big dogs. A moment after, they gave tongue within the papvrus: then we heard the savage grunt of tiie buffalo and saw its form just within the reeds; and as the ri lies cracked, flown it went. But it w as not dead, for we heard it grunt savagelv. and the dogs bayed asloud- lv as ever. Heat ley now mounted his trained shooting-pony and rode toward the place, while we covered him with our rifles, his plan being to run right across our front if the bull charged. The bull was past charg- ing, Iving just within the reeds, but he was still able to do damage, for in another minute one of the dogs came out by u; and tan straight back to the farm-house, where we found him dead on our return. He had been caught bv t le buffalo's horns when he went in too close. Heatlev. a daring fellow, w ith great confidence in both his horse and his rille pushed forw ard as we came up,and saw the bull lying on the ground while the two other dogs hit anti worried it; and he put a bullet thrcugh its head. I he remaining bull gt it off into the swamp, w here a week later Heatlev found his dead body. F  irtunately the head proved to be in less good condition than any of the others, as one Imrn w as broken off about half-way up; so tluit if any of the four had to escape, it was well that this should have been the one.   Mir three bulls were fine trophies. The largest, w ith the largest horns, was the first killed, being the one that fell to my first bullet; yet it was the youngest of the three. The other two were old bulls. The second one killed had smaller hums than the other but the bosses met in the middle of the fore- head for a space of several inches, making a solid shield. 1 had just been reading a pamphlet by a derm an specialist who had divided the African buffalo into fifteen or twenty dillerent spet its. based upon differ- ences in various pairs of horns. The worth o  siii h fine distinctions, w hen made on in- sut'ticient data, can be gathered from the lad that on the principles of specific divi- sion adopted in the pamphlet in question, the three bulls we had shot would have represented certainly two and possible three different species.   cniiicnaui k   Mr K Mj5cve t   teller  Hc:ttn:y at I-nt: ' . in:  Heller was soon on the ground with lii- skinning-tent and skinners, and the Boer tanner went 1  ai k to feU h the ox wagon on which the skins and meat were brought in t" ramp. Laymen can hardly realize, and 1 ertainly did not realize, what an immense amount of work is involved in getting and j  reparing the skins i  1" large animals sue. li as buffalo, rhino, hippo, and above all ele- phant. in hot i limates.    n this first live- wee k s  trip we got some seventy skins, in- haling twentv-two species ranging in size fn.m a dikdik to a rhino, and all of these Heller prepared and sent to the Smithso- nian. Mearnsand Loring were just as busy shouting birds and trapping small mam- mals. Often while Heller would be off for a few da    w ith Kermit and myself. Mearns and Loring would be ramped elsewhere, in a region better suited for the things thev were alter. While at luja    arm thev went down the Nairobi in a boat to .-hoot water- birds. and saw many more crocodiles and hip     than I did. I.oring is a remarkable succci-Mu 1 trapper o  -mall mammals. 1 do not believe there i . a better collector anv- w here. I  r. Mearns. in addition to binls and  ilants, newer let pass the oppc crtunit v to i o - lec t anything else from reptiles and tidies to land shells. More  er. he was the best diot in our party, lie killed two great l u tanb with the rille. and oci adonallv shot birds like vultures on the wing with a rille. I do not believe that three better men than 140 African Game Trails Mearns, Heller, and Loring, for such an ex- pedition as ours, could be found anywhere. It was three days later before we were again successful with buffalo. On this oc- casion we started about eight in the morn- ing, having come to the conclusion that the herd was more apt to leave the papyrus late than early. Our special object was to get a cow. We intended to take advantage of a small half-dried water-course, an affluent of the Kamiti, which began a mile beyond where we had killed our bulls, and for three or four miles ran in a course gener- ally parallel to the swamp, and at a dis- tance which variec, but averaged perhaps a quarter of a mile. When we reached the beginning of this water-course, we left our horses and walked along it. Like all such water-courses, it wound in curves. The banks were four or five feet high, the bot- tom was sometimes dry and sometimes con- tained reedy pools, while at intervals there were clumps of papyrus. Headev went ahead, and just as we had about concluded that the buffalo would not come out, he came back to tell us that he had seen several, and believed that the herd was with them. Cuninghame, a veteran hunter and first- class shot, than whom there could be no better man to have with one when after dangerous game, took charge of our further movements. We crept up the water-course until about opposite the buffalo, which were now lying down. Cuninghame peered cau- tiously at them, saw there were two or three, and then led us on all fours toward them. There were patches where the grass was short, and other places where it was three feet high, and after a good deal of cautious crawling we had covered half the distance toward them, whenoneof them madeus out, and several rose from their beds. They were still at least two hundred yards off a long range for heavy titles; but any closer ap- proach was impossible, and we fired. Both the leading bulls were hit, and at the shots there rose from the grass not half a dozen buffalo, but seventy or eighty, and started at a gallop parallel to the swamp and across our front. In the rear were a number of cows and calves, and I at once singled out a cow and fired. She plunged forward at the shot and turned toward the swamp, going slowly and dead lame, for my bullet had struck the shoulder and had gone into the cavity of the chest. But at this moment our attention was distracted from the wounded cow by the conduct of the herd, which, headed by the wounded bulls, turned in a quarter-circle toward us, and drew up in a phalanx facing us with outstretched heads. It was not a nice country in which to be charged by the herd, and for a moment things trembled in the balance. There was a perceptible motion of uneasiness among some of our followers.  Stand steady  Don t run   I called out.  And don t shoot   called out Cuninghame; for to do either would invite a charge. A few seconds passed, and then the unwounded mass of the herd resumed their flight, and after a little hesitation the wouudcd bulls followed. We now turned our attention to the wound- ed cow, which was close to the papyrus. She went down to our shots, but the reeds and marsh-grass were above our heads when we drew close to the swamp. Once again Heatley went in with his white horse, as close as it was even reasonably safe, with the hope either of seeing the cow, or of getting her to charge him and so give us a fair chance at her. But nothing happened and we loosed the two dogs. They took up the trail and went some little distance into the papyrus, where we heard them give tongue, and immediately afterward there came the angry grunt of the wounded buffalo. It had risen and gone off thirty yards into the papyrus, although mortally wounded the frothy blood from the lungs was actually coming out of my first bullet-hole. Its anger now made it foolish, and it followed the dogs to the edge of the papyrus. Here both Cuninghame and Heatley caught a glimpse of it. Down it went to their shots, and in a minute we heard the moaning bellow which a wounded buffalo often gives before dy- ing. Immediately afterward we could hear the dogs worrying it, whileit bellowed again. It was still living as I came up, and though it evidently could not rise, there was a chance of its damaging one of the dogs, so I finished it off with a shot from the Win- chester. Heller reached it that afternoon, and the skin and meat were brought in by the porters before nightfall. Cuninghame remained with the body while the rest of us rode off and killed sev- eral different animals we wanted. In the afternoon I returned, having a vaguelv uu- comfortable fee ing that as it grew dusk the buffalo might possibly make their appear- Porter- dancing when breaking camp at K. rn.ti.

Kermit and I rode off with Heatley to pass the night at his house. This was at the other end of his farm, in a totally different kind of country, a country of wooded hills, with glades and dells and lung green grass in the valleys. It did not in the least re- semble what one would naturally expect in equatorial Africa. On the contrary it re- minded me of the beautiful rolling wooded country of middle Wisconsin. But of course everything was really different. There were monkeys and leopards in the forests, and we saw whydah birds of a new kind, with red on the head and throat, and brilliantly colored woodpeckers, and black-and-gold weaver-birds. Indeed, the wealth of bird life was such that it cannot be described. Here, too, there were many birds with musi- cal voices, to which we listened in the early morning. The best timber was yielded by the tall mahogo tree, a kind of sandalwood. This was the tree selected by the wild fig for its deadly embrace. The wild fig begins as a huge parasitic vine, and ends as one ol the largest and most stately, and also one of the greenest and most shady, trees in this part of Africa. It grows up the mahogo as a vincand gradually, by branching, and by the spreading of the branches, completely en- velops the trunk and also grows along each limb, and sends out great limbs of its own. Every stage can be seen, from that in which the big vine has begun to grow up along the still flourishing mahogo, through that in which the tree looks like a curious com- posite, the limbs and thick foliage of the fig branching out among the limbs and scanty foliage of the still living mahogo, to the stage in which the mahogo is simply a dead skele- ton seen here and there through the trunk or the foliage of the fig. Finally nothing remains but the fig, which grows to be a huge tree. Heatley s house was charming, with its vine-shaded veranda, its summer-house and out-buildings, and the great trees clus- tered round about. He was fond of sport in ihe right way, that is, he treated il as sport and not business, and did not allow il to in- terfere with his prime work of being a suc- cessful farmer. He had big stock-yards for his cattle and swine, and he was growing all kinds of things of both the temperate and the tropic zones: wheat and apples, coffee and sugar-cane. The bread we ate and the coffee we drank were made from what he had grown on his own farm. There were roses in the garden and great bushes of heliotrope by the veranda, and the drive to his place was bordered by trees from Aus- tralia and beds of native flowers. Next day we went in to Nairobi, where we spent a most busy week, especially the three naturalists; for the task of getting into shape for shipment and then shipping the many hundreds of specimens indeed, all told there were thousands of specimens  was of herculean proportions. Governor I ackson a devoted ornithologist and prob- ably the best living authority on East African birds, taking into account the stand-points of both the closet naturalist and the field naturalist spent hours with Mearns, helping him to identify and arrange the species. Nairobi is a very attractive town, and most interesting, with its large native quar ter and its Indian colony. One of the streets consists of little except Indian shops and bazaars. Outside the business portion, the town is spread over much territory, the houses standing isolated, each by itself, and each usually bowered in trees, with vines shading the verandas, and pretty flower-gardens round about. Not only do I firmly believe in the future of East Africa for settlement as a white man s country, but I feel that it is an ideal playground alike for sportsmen, and for travellers who wish to live in health and comfort, and yet to see what is beautiful and unusual.  REST HARROW' A COMEDY OF RESOLUTION BY MAURICE HEWLETT Illustration by Frank Craig book n SANCHIA AX WANLESS HALL. I TELEGRAM was handed to her as she came in from the garden, her broad-brim- med straw hat in her hand and a bunch of fritillaries nodding in her blouse. That dates and places her at once: the dme was April, and she was fond of curious flowers. She stood in the doorway to get the sunset glow upon the missive, and was herself en- sanguined and enhanced, a sunny-haired, low-breasted young woman of middle height, rather faintly colored, wholesome to see, with a bowed upper lip, and clear, gray- blue eyes of extreme directness and candor. A trick of looking you full, of considering you and her answer together, she had; a mild, steady beam, a radiance within the orb which told of a hidden glory. Her brows were level, eyebrows arched; her bust, though set like Aphrodite s of Melos, was full. The curving comers of the bow of her lips assured her the possession, even when she was most serious, of a lurking smile. Taking off her gardening gloves, that she might break the red en- velope, she disclosed a pair of fine, white, nervous hands, and pointed fingers which wore no rings. The address, which she was careful to read before she tore the envelope, was: Miss Percival, Waul css, Felsboro. Opening then, she read as follows:  Home to-morrow seven people Ingram.  If she frowned slightly, it was a mere ap- proach of the fine eyebrows to each other. She certainly smiled wisely and medita- Vol. XLVII. 17 tively, without showing her teeth. She touched her chin a rounded, full chin  with the telegram as she looked up at the maid who brought it.   I must see Mrs. Benson about this. It s from Mr. Ingram.   Yes, Miss Percival.  A friendly desire to share the puzzle was now manifest in the clear eyes.   You see, Minnie, it might mean one of two things, and I m not quite sure which of them it does mean.  She looked again at the message with amused interest; but one could not have said whether she was amused at her interest, or interested in her amusement. That was part of Miss Perci- val s charm that she was always baffling you. But Minnie, the maid, was demure and monotonous under the attack of friendly desires.  No, Miss Percival,  she said; and added,   I m sure I couldn t say." She stood aside from the doorway as the young lady entered the billiard-room, saying asshe went,   Ask Mrs. Benson to come to my room, Minnie, please; and tell Frodsham I should like to see him directly he comes to- morrow morning.  She heard Minnie s   Very well, Miss Percival,  as she disappeared, smiling still, and with a slight heightening of color. When her color rose, it rose evenly, flooding her face and neck with the dawn-hue. There were no patches or streaks of flame; she showed, as it were, incandescent. She crossed the hall in the deepening dusk, a fine, littered room, where a great log-fire revealed the tall portraits of ladies and gentlemen of long ago sportsmen with spaniels at their feet, general officers in scar- i45 146 Rest Harrow let, pointing through smoke the direction of the enemy, a judge in ermine and full- bottomed wig, a lady in white satin, lean- ing against a  broken column in a paxk and backed by a brewing thunder-storm; and as she went her way, gave a couple of glances to right and left, picked up a Bradshaw from a side-table, stooped to put a tiger- skin straight. She continued down a long corridor, swinging her hat, and entered an open doorway at the extreme end. By the way she tossed the hat on to a chair and stirred the crackling logs with the point of her shoe, it was to be supposed that she was in her demesne. Standing with a foot on the fender, she presently fell into a reverie, and presently reopened and reread her tel- egram. Certainly she was smiling, and cer- tainly her color was enhanced. The room, though business-like, was fem- inine. It had a Chippendale bureau be- tween the windows, its pigeon-holes stuffed with papers; but there were flowers upon it, and elsewhere many photographs and pict- ures evidently chosen by the tenant. The Dante from the Bargello was one, the three headless fates of the Parthenon another; the Hermes and the Sophocles, all in auto- gravure. It had a piano and a small book- case containing the poets in green morocco, a uniform set. Elsewhere, in a larger book- case, were miscellaneous volumes, by no means all novels, though novels there were. One shelf was filled with household books: cookery, bee-keeping, poultry, the dog in health and disease, the horse, the flower- garden, botany, British edible fungi, the world of vegetables, were some of the sub- jects treated of. Below the bookcase was a row of japanned tin boxes, carefully let- tered in white paint. House accounts, gar- den accounts, stable accounts, one read. A fourth bore the words,  Wood Sales and Miscellaneous.  If you were alone, waiting in the room, you would glance at the photographs perch- ed about, like alighting butterflies, upon piano and mantel-shelf and occasional table. You would pass over, I believe, the children on ponies and in sailor suits, that elderly, ample lady, brooched and in black, beam- ing under the status of Grandmamma, that gaitered gentleman with a square-topped felt hat upon his head and grizzled whisk- ers below his ears, in favor of a group of five girls in black muslin and lace, sisters evidently, prosperously together, an un- commonly happy five. They look on good terms with themselves and with each other. They look frankly at you out of the frame  and how they must have dazzled the pho- tographer, with their five pair of bright, uncompromising eyes  Hands rest easily upon familiar shoulders, elbows on knees. One of them smiles outright, two are veiy ready to smile, one is more serious, as be- comes the eldest of five; and one is round- cheeked and solemn: the baby. Miss Percival and her sisters, it s clear. One can t mistake the rounded chin, the level brows, the promise of womanhood. Women should always be photographed in evening dress if, like the Misses Percival, they have nothing to hide. But now to pick out our Miss Pcrcival. You will observe that the young ladies  names are neatly printed beneath their persons. Even if I were sure of dates, I should not insist upon the serious one. So far as I can judge, the photograph is some eight or ten years old. I go by the style of hair-dressing which it shows, and by the name of the pho- tographer, who signs from Wigmore Street. He is out of date; fashion has deserted him. Then that grave, watchful young goddess, who sits enthroned with her nymphs about her, must be a great deal older than our lady of this room, of the doubtful smile and friendly desires. She has the sedate air of eight-and-twenty, and by this time must be thirty-six or even more. She is Philippa, anyhow, we read. Who comes next   Here is Hawise, standing behind herof the throne and the centre, with a hand on her bare shoulder. She is laughing, sleepily; she is distinctly pretty, but distinctly, also,fat. She cannot be the owner of this room. There s a taste for names in the Percival family; we have Philippa, Hawise. Nowfor the seated pair, one on either side of Philip- pa ; they are Melusine, who has a long neck and a very demure look, and a great deal of hair, and Victoria, who, having just tossed back her mane, lifts her chin and glimmers at you through half-shut eyes. Her Kps laugh snugly, at some mischief meditating. Neither of these can be our lady, who must therefore be the last and youngest,this child of eighteen or so, round-cheeked, round- eyed and serious, withcritical lids, like those of the Famese Hera, and a beautiful mouth: Sanchia-Josepha, crouched on the floor at Rest Harrow 147 the feet of Philippa. A charming bevy of maidens- Philippa, Hawise, Melusine, Vic- toria, Sanchia-Josepha; ten years ago hap- pily sisters anrl rich in promise, looking out boldly at the veiled ve .rs ahead of them. Ten years ago  Call it eight, and you make our Miss Percival, say, six-and-twenty by this time. There are many other photographs, of girls and women, most of them; l ut here is a nan, dignified by a place apart upon the bureau, lie occupies one side of it by him- self, balanced by the sisters at the other. A youngish man in yeomanry uniform, he appears only in torso. He has the smooth head of a soldier, and rather a low,   ui verv square, forehead. Ilis eyes are smallish, and set deep. 'I'hey look to be gray, light gray, but may be light blue. He has a good nose, high-bridged, large, thin, and prac- tically straight. Such noses are seldom perfectly straight, and his is not. I observe that he has curled liis moustache with the tongs, so that it is well away from liis upper lip. If I had been he, I should not have done that. It is too much trouble and if a man takes pains about his toilette, those pains ought not to be evident. Moreover, the mouth is by no means this young man s best feature. There is a twist, the hint of a snarl in the upper lip. The lower pro- trudes. The gentleman is the least in life underhung. Consider his chin. It has the jut of the Hapsburgs, of Charles the Fifth s, not pronounced by any means, but un- doubtedly there. Firmness, or perhaps ob- stinacy, hard judgment, an uneven temper, a leaning to autocracy, I read in this por- trait. There is no signature, nothing to tell you who he is. Certainly, no Percival. 1 call your attention to one more photo- graph, in marked distinction to others of your notice. Those were, in even- sense, full-dress affairs; this one, in all senses, un- dress. It is the work of an amateur, you can see at once; small, rather blurred to begin with, not perfectly focussed, and fail- ing now towards the end of all such gear. It represents a bareheaded young lady in a white gown, pinned very high. -She is standing in a pond, with the water well over her knees. One hand keeps her balance with a pole, the other grasps a streamer of water-weed. Floating beyond her upon some kind of raft is a man, bareheaded also, in a white sweater with a rolling collar. His face is shadowed you can see that his hair, black and straight, falls over his eyes. He is raking up the weed with his hand, his arm bare to the shoulder. Below is written, in a round, sprawling hand,   T  Sanchia fn nn Percy.  Both the workers are intent upon their task, with no idea that they are posing. 'I'he girl has a  jreek face, and a very line pair of legs, heedlessly displayed. The m;:n is as thin as a gvpsy. Out of the dark in which his face is hidden gleam his white teet 1. A classical, rather than nimantic, scene. TIn- absence of draperies suggest it; but the ab- sence of self-consciousness is conclusive. But 1 keep Miss Percival too long at the fender. She had been standing there fi r some minutes after her entry, first reread- ing her telegram, next stroking herchin w ith it. She was thoughtful still and smiling.    nce she looked over her shoulder through the window to the dying day and lightly sighed. The time was April s end, and had been squally with violent storms; but the last onslaughts of the north-wester had routed the rain-clouds. The day was dying under a clear saffron sky, and a thrush piped i'.s mellow elegy. Miss Percival heard him, and listened, smiling with her pale lips and eves which the serene light soothed. Her lips barely moved, just relaxed their firm em- brace, but no more. She held the light grate- fully with hereyes, seemed unwilling tolosea moment of it, wistful to be still out-of-doors. Again she lightly sighed, and presently re- sumed her downward gazing at the lire. Knuckles quavered at the door. She straightened herself, turned, and called out definitely,  Come in.  Mrs. Benson stocd before her, vast, massive, black-gowned, cloudy for trouble, a cook. There was instantly to be observed in Miss Percival's lifted head and eyes the same frank appeal for interchange of senti- ments as had been manifested to Minnie the maid. Her brows were smoothed out, her smile became less dubious; her intention to be friendly was deliberately expressed. But truth will have it that, just as before, Mrs. Benson's guard turned out at the same m  - ment, as at a signal. To vary the figure, her vedettes, in touch with the advancers, fell back upon the main body. if the young lady perceived this, she did notceasetobeamiablydisposed.   Oh, Mrs. Benson.  she said,   I ve had a telegram.  Mrs. Benson, with strict non-committal, 148 Rest I iarrow lifted her eyebrows tc   Well, well    It was as if she implied that such things were to be expected in a world full of trouble.  S   I hear, Miss Percival,  she grimly said.   It s from Mr. Ingram, you know.   Ah, well   Mrs. Benson could have- been heard to sigh; but among llie many things which Miss Percival chose to ignore, this sort of thing was one. Trouble to her, always, was a signal which braced the nerves and sinews.   It s to say but 1 think you had better read it.  It was held out unfalteringly, while Mrs. Benson dived for, opened, wiped, tested, and fixed her spectacles. These op- erations concluded, it was received as migl t have been a dangerous explosive. Punctuating as she went, Mrs. Benson read,  Home lo-nwrrou' sn cn prop e  Ingram.'1' Then she looked, confirmed in her omens, over the rim of her spectacles.  Seven people, Miss Percival  A house- party  And, as you may say, at a moment s notice. Dear, dear, dear   Miss Percival remained cheerful.  Oh, I don t read it like that,  she said, went be- hind Mrs. Benson, and read over her shoul- der, pointing the words with a pencil sti.l wet from her mouth,   Home to-morrow, seven with people Ingram.  That s what it must mean, of course.  She spoke woc- ingly, but Mrs. Benson was not to be won.  Then, why does ie say   Seven people.  Miss Percival  Why does he say that    But he doesn't, according to me.  She laughed.   He is telling us the. time of his train. How could ue meet him and his people if he didn't     Ah,  said Mrs. Benson, heavily pre- pared for the worst," how could we   That s where it is, you sec. But of course he wouldn t think of us."  But he does, you know. He has. He says that he will have people with hiii . That is to prepare us.  Mrs. Benson s list crashed into the paper.   How many people, Miss Percival   How many people  Why, seven, of course  What else could it be  And where s the lish ti  come from for seven people  And what about maids and valets  Does he count up the likes of them  He s not Mr. Ingram if he does. Not he  Nor his father before him. And what s Frodsham goinT     do about carriage room for seven and the servants as well and the luggage and all   Dogs, very likely; dogs and cats, and parrots. Who knows  I ve seen  em bring scritch-owls and hawks on their wrists before now. Oh they ll do anything, some of  em anything to be looked at. That s what it is; they want looking ut. And I d look al  em if I had my way   Mrs. Benson, shining with indignant heat, had to be pacified. She required much tact, the exercise of a low and musical voice. It cooed upon her like a dove s. Miss Percival used her hands, too, and in the end had one of them on Mrs. Benson s shoulder. The charm worked. Dinner should be cooked for five cr six; Frodsham should meet the seven-four from London with the omnibus and luggage-cart. There would be no dogs at this time of year. Parrots were urged upon her again, but tentatively. She chuckled them away, musically, with real relish for the picture. She was sure there would be no parrots. Now, she must see about the bedrooms but Mrs. Benson peered round into her glowing face.   And what about your supper. Miss Per- cival   It s just upon ready. And there s a sweetbread.  Miss Percival almost caressed the ridicu- lous, good soul. Her arm remained about her shoulder, her hand touched it.  How nice of you  I'll go and get ready at once. Then I ll see what rooms we had better have. Wasn t it lucky we did the drawing- rooms last week    Gloom gathered again. Mrs. Benson thought that si m peo  Ie didn t deserve their luck. It wasclear .owhom she referred: cer- tainlynot to Miss Percival,for instance. But the young lady, with really extraordinary simplicity, replied that surely Mr. Ingram deserved credit for having well chosen his ministers.   Yourself,  she said,  for the kitchen, and me for the hall.  Sheexploded this little bomb with some heightening of col   r. Mrs. Benson, glancing at her sideways, observed the blush and was scared. She blinked. Miss l ercival s blush deepened. In the awkward pause that ensued the friendly hand was about to be removed, when Mrs. Benson, with an effort which did honor to her resources, said:  We all have our troubles, Miss Percival, else we shouldn t be here, as the Bible says. The good book  W ell for them as read therein. Now, only this afternoon Mr. Menzies was Rest Harrow talking to me about things at largo, and lie says,  Mrs. Benson, what s to be done with Struan Clyde   quite sudden. So I says,  And what should lie done with such a one, Mr. Menzies, but wallop him    and he shakes his head and says,   He s on the cata- rampus, ma am in one of his black fits, "l'ells me to go my way and let him alone; then turns his back.  Now, what about such troubles as that, Miss Percival    Miss Percival looked serious, but not es- pecially in forested. Her eyes I   okcd I  ef  ire her, but seemed not to sec anything. She asked: What did Mr. Men .ies say     him next   but if she was interested, it was not in that matter. Mrs. Benson brandished her voice.    Ha, you may well ask me.  No, my man,  he says,  but 'tis you that must go mine while I m head gardener at Wanless,  he says. That s what Mr. Men .ies told him, the elderly man that he is and now look at this. Young Clyde turns his back upon him, with no more notice taken than you or I would have of a Ilea on the arm. Insolence, that is. Downright insolence to an elderly man. Ah,  said Mrs. Ben- son with tightening lips,   if you come to troubles    Miss Percival s tone was sympathetic, if her eyes were still sightless.   Really  I m very sorry. I ll sec Mr. Menzies about it to- morrow, and, of course, I II talk to Struan. He is difficult it s very tiresome of him. I saw him this afternoon, but had no notion of all this. I can t think how it is. Nerves, I suppose. He s a human creature, you see, as well as a gardener.  Mrs. Benson was incapable of seeing such a possible combination; her explanation was simpler. Human  She scorned him.   Bad blood,  she said with energy;   bad, black, gypsy blood. He ll be murdering one of us in her bed in a day or two. You see if he don t.  Miss Percival did not deny the sugges- tion. She considered it rather its effect, its effectiveness.  Struan is tiresome, of course,  she presently said,   but I do think he has tried to restrain himself lately. He promised me he would.  She turned her full gaze suddenly upon Mrs. Benson, and almost disarmed that lady.   1 like him, you know. He s very nice to me.  Mrs. Benson gasped, but recovered just in time to resume the dark oracles in her keeping.  Ah,  she said,  he would be. If you can call it nice- -  He s wonderful in  he garden,  Miss Percival calmly continued.   I'.vcn Men- zies admits it. He ll work all day. He s never tired.   Nor s a tiger," the cook snapped.   Nor s a tom-cat.  Miss Percival looked pitifully at her and smiled.   Poor Struan you don t like him. I ll see him to-night. 1 have an influence, I think.  Mrs. Benson touched the hand that lay within her reac.li, which had lately been upon her shoulder. " Don t, my dear, don t.  she said.  Why not " asked the lady with her lifted brow s.   Why shouldn t 1    " Influence  The likesof him, the likes   Gypsy blood at midnight soft-voiced, mur- derous--  She gave no coherent answer, but smiled always, then leaned forward and stroked Mrs. Benson upon her personable cheek.   Dear old thing, let me do as I like. It s much better f  r everybody,  she presently said. II It had clouded over after sunset; there was no moon visible, but an irradiance was omnipresent and showed the muffled yew - tree walks and the greater trees colossal, mountains overshadowing the land. Here and there, as you went, glimmered daffodils like the Pleiades half-veiled, and long files of crocuses burned like waning fires. Miss Percival, at about nine o clock, came gently down one of these alleys, with a scarf over her head and shoulders. She looked like a nymph in Tanagra. As if she knew where she was going, exactly, she walked gently but unfalteringly between the linked crocus-beacons to whore the alley broad- ened intoa bay of cut yews, to where ghostly white seats and a dim sun-dial seemed dis- posedasfora scene in a comedy. Theleaden statue of a skipping faun would have been made out in arecess, if you had known it was there. And as she entered the place a fig- ure seated there, with elbows on knees and chin between his palms, looked up, listening, watched intently, then rose and waited.  Struan,  said Miss Percival comfort- ably,   are you there       I m here,  she was answered. 150 Rest Harrow Thereupon, she camc easily forward and stood near him. She was in white from top to toe; he could see the clean outUne of her head and neck, defined by the hooding scarf. He had not taken off his hat, but now, as she stood there, silent, he slowly removed it. Still there was nothing said. Miss Percival was veiy deliberate. Presently she spoke.   You didn t tell me this afternoon that you d had a bother with Mr. Menzies. Why didn t you tell me    Why should I tell you   The words seemed wrung from him.   Why should you care    Of course I care,  she said.  You know that I care. Why didn t you tell me   . . . But I know wrhy you didn t.    You do not.  He denied her hotly.  Oh, but I do. Because you were ashamed.   It was not. I m not ashamed. He s an old fool. He thinks he can teach me my business. Melons  Plants  Why, I m one of them. What can he tcach me     He s a very good gardener,  Miss Per- cival began; but the rest was drowned.  Gardener he  He s a botcher. He measures his melons by the pound. It s money he wants, money-value. So much dung so much meat. He says,   Be care- ful, you, of the water-pot; go steady with your syringe. You ll damp off those plants if you re not handy,  he tells me. To me. this  Don t I know what the life of a plant must have and how and where it must be fed  He s an old fool, and you know it, And I ll not be told things I have got by heart before a lad new to his breeches. Besides,  he added darkly,   he d vexed me before that and bitterly.    How did he vex you     Miss Percival's voice came cool and clear, but commanding.  That I cannot tell you,  said he.  But I want to know.  This seemed to her sufficing reason. But he was dogged.   Then I can t help you. You cannot be told.   But perhaps I ought to be told. Do you think I ought    Indeed, I don t know .   Well, will you tell me     I will not, indeed. That is, I cannot."   It s very extraordinaiy.  He made no answer.  Struan,  said Miss Percival, after a while,  you are angry.  He turned quickly.  With you  Never.   Ididn tsaythat. I said you were angry.  He said,   Ah and so 1 am.    I am included, I suppose.    You are not. It could not be.  She laughed.  I don t know-  He was vehement.   But you do know You know it very well.  She had no answer; but she smiled to herself, and I have no doubt she knew. For two minutes or more there was silence, a time of suspense. Then Miss Percival said,  I ve had a telegram. Mr. Ingram is coming to-morrow.  To this he said nothing. She went on.  He is bringing people with him. Mrs. Benson was very funny about it. He is coming at seven with some people, and she would read it that he was coming with seven people. When I asked her how could we meet him if he had not told us the time, she made a grievance of it and said that was so like him. So it is, of course.  Struan remained speechless, and had turned away his face. Miss Percival con- tinued her reflections aloud.  How long has he been away  More than a year. He wrote once from Singa- pore then from Rawal-Pindi and that was all, until I got this telegram. He s very casual, I must say.  Here she paused. Struan said suddenly,  Miss Percival, I m going.  She turned with interest and asked with not too much interest,   Oh  Why   He said,  You know wrhy.  She lowered her voice by a tone, but no more.   I hope you won t. It would be a pity. There sno real reason for it. I ll speak to Menzies to-morrow. He doesn t meanany harm to you. He's only old and grumpy.    He s a fool,  said Struan.   Certainly, he s a fool. But that s neither here nor there.  Miss Percival, ignoring what she chose to ignore, said again,   I hope you w on t go.  The young man shifted his ground and dug his heel into the turf.  I must in- deed, I must.    Where shall you go       God knows.   Why must you go    You know' why.   Is it because of Menzies   He threw his head up.   Menzies, for- sooth     He scorned Menzies. Rest Harrow   Then I don t see why you should g . I shouldn t like it. I hope you will stay.  He looked at her now across the dusk, in- tensely.  You hope 1 will stay     Yes, certainly I do.   You hope 1 will stay  You ask me to stay   She considered. Then she said, Yes, I think so. Yes, I do.   Then,  said Struan,  God help us all. I stay.  Miss Percival said cheerfully,  I'm s   glad. I'll speak to Menzies to-morrow, and get him to leave you alone. He knows how well you do the melons, but of course he would never admit it.  She broke off the interview shortly afterward.   I'm going to bed,  she told him.   I ve got lots to do to-morrow. Heaps of tilings. You must get me some of your  lowers for the rooms.  lie was not appeased.   Menzies will do it,  he said. She laughed.   You know what Menzies will say   Pelargoniums for the hall, Miss Percival, and some nice maidenhair.  He s not in- ventive, poor Menzies.   He's an old fool,  said Straun.  He takes flowers for spangles in a circus.  Miss Percival again laughed softly anil held out her hand.   Good night,  she said.   I'm going.  He touched her hand, and then put his own behind his back.  Aren t you going to bed   she asked him.  Presently,  he said.  I m going to walk round for a while.  She hovered for a moment, seemed to hesitate, to weigh the attractions of walking round. It had a charm. Then she decided.   Good-night,  she bade him for the third time. He grumbled his good night and watched her fade into the dark. Not until she was completely hidden up did he put on his hat again. Then he prowled noiselessly about among the breathing flowers. Ill Wanlkss, as they call it there, Wanless Hall, Felsboro , as it is politically, stands squarelyand deeplyin the hills of a northern county, plentifully embowered in trees, with a river washing its southern side. To reach house from river you ascend a gentle slope of lawns and groves for some hundreds of feet, then find a broad stepway. That takes you to a terraced, parapeted garden, very well tended, as one should be which has four men at its disposition. There stands the house of Wanless -stone-built in the days of Charles the Second a gleaming, gray front, covered to the first-floor w in- dows with a magnolia of unknown age. The main entrance faces north, from whit li point the true shape of the place is revealed as a long body with wings, an E-shaped house. Here arc the carriage-drive and carriage-swcep; then there s a belt of trees and beyond that, shaped by the valley which gradually narrows to  he incline of the hills, kitchen-gardens, glass-houses, a pond  fed by a beck , water meadows, and hanging woods. Above those again heather- clad slopes climb to piled rocks and a rag- ged sky-line. It is a fine property, with five thousand acres of shooting, a good many farms, and a hill village to its account. The lodge at the gate is half a mile away, at the end of a good avenue of beech and syca- more. Mr. Nevile Ingram, who, at thirty, had still the air of a brisk young man and was owner by inheritance of this place, arrived with his guests by the seven-four train from London. The omnibus brought the four of them, with a maid sitting on the box beside Frodsham, and a bank of luggage behind her head. No parrots, no dogs; but a Mr. Chevenix brought his fishing-rods. Besides this Mr. Chevenix, who had been here be- fore, there was an elderly Mrs. Devercux, white-haired and short-sighted, who used, whenever she could find them, a pair of long-handled glasses, and a young Mrs. Wilmot, pretty, very fair, rather helpless. It was her maid who shared the box seat with Frodsham. The absence of a footman at the station had been noted by Mrs. Devercux, the absence of any man-servant at the house struck her as remarkable. There were none, and had been none since Miss Percival as- sumed command; but at this time Mrs. Devereux knew nothing of Miss Percival. Nevile Ingram, banging the door open with his knee, jumped out first and stood to help the ladies; the next to emerge was Mr. Chevenix, who, the moment he touched earth, said,  Right   and looked as if he Rest Harrow had sparkled. Il was dear that lie had abundant health and was satisfied with all the arrangements of Providence. lie surveyed the house, the awaiting virgins at the dour, wished them both good-evening, nosed the upper air, snuffed the gale, said   Good old Wan less mv precious rods'" and dived for them before the ladies could descend. Thereafter, a timidly poising foot and some robust breadth of stocking re- vealed the anxieties ol .Mrs. Devereux. On alighting, she shook herself like a hen and her draperies rustled to fheir length. She found her lorgnettes and surveyed  so to speak  the absent men-servants with blank misgivings. A maid advanced for her jewel- case, but Mrs. Devereux. shutting her eyes, said,  Thanks, I earn,' il,  and pressed it to her bosom. A In tier would have had it. Meantime. Mrs. Wilmot. a hand to each cavalier, was descending from the omnibus. She was a pretty, bedraped lady, with wide, blue, Greuze eyes and soft lips, always wet and mostly apart. She murmured,   How kind you are to me." and looked it from lugiam to Clieveni.t. Ingram said noth- ing, but Chevenix dropped down his brisk.  By Jove, Mrs. Wilmot, that s nothing to what I could do for you nothing at all.  And then they turned to the house. When Miss Percival, looking frailer than she really was because of her black gown - fairer that is and paler, entered the hall, she found the party at a loose end. Mr. Chevenix was in a deep chair, turning over Bradshaw and whistling softly to himself, Ingram, hands in pockets, was deprecat- ing  he portraits of his ancestors to the two ladies, who were not at all interested in them. lie appeared to be considerably bored by his guests and they to be a ware of it. Miss Pen aval's arrival was timely il only because she eltei. tively chased out ennui. Chevenix, as if he had been waiting for her, jumped up and went to meet her. He shook hands. " Hulloa, Sancie  '" lie was heard distinctly to say.   Bv Jove, I am glad to see you again.  The latter sentence was not quite audible, blit sufficiently so to send Mrs. Devereux's lorgnettes up to her nose. Miss Percival herself, receiving civilities as if born to them, impelled her to keep them there. She had appeared silently and suddenly, out of the blue. And now she hovered, smiling, fair and unconcerned, like a goddess out   f a chariot come to deal judgment, and listened charitably to Mr.   hevenix. How odd  How more than odd  Mrs. Wilmot looked as if her eyes were full of tears, but let nothing escape her. As for Ingram, he greeted the apparition with a smile and a nod sideways. But Mrs. Devereux could have sworn to a scare in the eye.  How are you, Sanchia   lie- said: and then to his guests,  Miss Percival will show you where you all are, if you'll  Dinner s at half-past eight, I believe. At least, it always used to be; but I've been away for a year, and they may have changed all that. Have vmi, by the way   he asked, with a sudden turn to Miss Percival. She looked calmly at him.  No. It s still at half-past eight,  she said. He lit his cigarette.   Will you show theseladiestheirrocms   he required of her, adding as an afterthought,   Mrs. Devereux, Mrs. Wilmot. Mrs. Wil- mot has a maid somewhere.  It was a quasi-introduction, awkwardly done. Miss Percival gravely bowed, and all might have been well had not her gentle smile persisted. The baffling quality of this, the archaic enigma of it, made Mrs. Wilmot stare at her helplessly with brimming blue eves. It made Mrs. Devereux shiver. It was she, however, who accepted the inclina- tion of the head.  Good-evening to you,  she said. The housekeeper  This per- son  The pair of them followed her up- stairs, Mrs. Devereux marching before, like one of the old regime to the guillotine, Mrs. Wilmot trailing in her wake. Young Chevenix, when they had disap- peared, returned with a grin to his Brad- shaw.  Nochange from Sanchia,  he said; and,  Let s see: Birmingham- d  pari 4.45. By Gad, that s a good train. No,  he re- sumed.  No change out of Sancie. How long is it since you were here, Nevile   Ingram was staring blankly out of the win- dow.   1 think a year. I don t know. Y,ou went out with me to Brindisi, 1 believe, and that was April, and so s this just. So you can work it out. I   you want me to fix you up.-'   ou're in the east wing, you know  I expect you are, anyhow.    here you were before.  " Right,  said Chevenix;  right. Only we re none of us where we were before, mv boy. Don t flatter yourself.  He shut Bradshaw with a bang, and went off, sing- Rest Harrow 153 ing softly, to a tune of liis own,   No change, no change from Sanchia,  which he turned into  Who is Sanchia, what is she  That all our swains ...    Miss Percival, having played the exact and perfect housekeeper above with no apparent interest in life but submergence in her duties returned to the ground floor and sought Minnie in the dining-room. She made her survey calmly, and gave such orders as pertained in smooth tones which could not jar. She seemed to consult where she really directed.   Shall we have the epergne   I think we will, don t you   Yes. It s a grand occasion. I don t think we have ever had ladies at Wanless before.  An admission which staggered Minnie. Her   Oh, yes, Miss Percival,  or   Oh, no, Miss Percival,  were appreciative and good to hear. She was butler, we find, as well as house- keeper; for as she stood there, meditating the table, Ingram came in, in a hurry, with ideas about wine. He gave them out in jerks, without looking at her. Sherry, of course, a hock, Lafite. No champagne: it s beastly unless you are tired. Oh, and old brandy the very old. Nothing of the sort to be had in India. The climate kills it. He stood very close to her as he spoke. When he remembered the brandy he put his hand on her shoulder, and finding it there, kept it so. Minnie presently went out of the room upon affairs, and then he looked into her face and said in a new tone:  How are you, Sancie   He let his hand slide down, encircled her waist lightly with his arm. She gave him her gray eyes and a slow, patient smile.   I am quite well,  she said.   Are you     Ingram, watching her still, seemed disconcerted, as if he wanted to say or do more, but couldn t for some rea- son. What he did was to remove his hand quickly and thrust it into his trouser pocket. It might have been suddenly stung, judging from his way of whipping it away.   Oh, I m all right, of course. I must go and dress, I suppose.  A year is a long time for an absence. In the doorway he stopped and looked back, a last look.   Supper in my room, you know. WTe lltalk.  She held to her mysteries and he went. Dinner passed gayly, Miss Percival away. Ingram was loquacious, though rather caus- tic; Chevenix a good foil, easy-tempered, al- ways at a run, a very fair marksman for all his random shooting. His was that happy disposition which finds Nature at large, including men, as precisely there for his amusement. He relished, never failed to relish, the works of God. But then he had perfect health. Mrs. Devereux was some- thing of a grandee, though not quite so much of one as she suspected. Her white hair towered; she wore black velvet and diamonds. Mrs. Wilmot was very much of a pretty woman, and knew to the turn of a hair how much. She had the air of a spoiled child, which became her; was golden and rosy, could pout; had dark blue eyes, which she could cloud at will and fill, as we know, with tears. Sheexcelled in pathetic silences, to which her parted lips gave an air of being breathless. She was beautifully dressed in cloudy, filmy tilings, and had a soft, slight, drooping figure. Innocence was her forte: her rings were superb. One odd thing was noticeable and no- ticed intensely by Chevenix: that Ingram hardly ate anything, though he pretended to a hearty meal. It came, Chevenix saw, to dry toast and three glasses of wane, prac- tically. But he made great play with knife and fork and talked incessantly. He re- vealed himself at ever ' turn of his mono- logue for it came to be a monologue as one of those men whose motives are so trans- parently reasonable to themselves that they need never be at the trouble to explain or defend any act of theirs. He was witty, though occasionally brutal, as when he spoke of a dragoman he had had in Egypt whose defence of his harem had cost him his place. This man, a cultivated Persian, had pro- posed hospitality to his patron in Alexandria where he lived. Accepted, he had made a great supper for Ingram, invited his friends and acquaintances, procured musicians and dancing-girls. It was magnificent, Ingram allowed. The trouble came afterwards, when the native guests had gone their ways and patron and host were together. In- gram proposed a visit to the ladies   the civil thing, it appeared to me. But no, if you please. Mirza turned very glum, pro- nounced it not the custom; I must excuse him, he says. But I say, Will they excuse vie, my good man   He makes a sour face, so of course I know that they won t, and that he knows they won t. Then he marches away upon some errand or another, and Rest Harrow when he comes back finds me tapping at a dour. You never saw such a change in a chap; upon my soul, it was worth it. He went white, he went gray, he went livid. His eyes were like stars. No, I m wring. They were not. They were like the llaning sword which kept Adam and Eve out of the garden. Magnificent police arrange- ments in Eden, they had. 1 heard his breath whistle through his nose like the wind at a key hole. Ho says,   You mistake, sir. You forget. Or do i deserve to be insulted   1 told him that I was the insulted perscn in the party, and the ladies came next. I swear 1 heard a chuckle behind the door. That 1 swear to.:  Chevenix, round-eyed and staring, was heard to mutter,   Good old Nevile  Well, I'll be shot   Ingram cut short his tale.   I can t go into what followed. Muc h of it was irrelevant, all of it was preposterous. It ended by Mirza directing me to the near- est hotel, in perfect English. The crosser he got, the better his English. That s odd, you know. Of course, I chucked the cliap. He lost a soft billet.  There were no comments from the audi- tory, save such as Mrs. Wilmot's eyes may have afforded. She sighed and laid her hand for one moment, caressingly, upon her neck. Her rings were certainly superb. The dessert being on the table, Minnie served the old brandy and retired. Ingram drank of it freely, and began his cigarette the moment that the coffee and sjiirit- lla me appeared. The ladies withdrew to the drawing-room, and Mrs. Wilmot sought the piano. But two chords had not been touched before her eyes sought those of Mrs. Devereux, who stood by the lire. Eye- brows exchanged signals. Then Mrs. Devereux said:  1 am most uncomfortable,  and Mrs. Wilmot sighed,   I know.  IV Tnr. quiet cause   f discomfort, slippered and loose-robed, sat, meanwhile, in an easv- chair, with her feet   n the fender. Her hair floated free about her shoulders, silky from the brush. Sht  Dad a book on her knees but did not read it. Instead, she looked into the lire, frowning. Faint lines now printed themselves upon her face: two between her brows, one defin- ing the round cf each fair cheek. Her eyes showed fathomless sapphire; whatever her thoughts were of, they held the secret close. Their gaze was one of fascination, as if she saw things in the fire terrible and strange, figures of the past or of the future, from which she could not turn her face. The curve of her upper lip where it lay along its fellow and made a dimpled end, sharpened and grew bleak. Poring and smiling into the lire, she looked like a Sibyl envisaging the fate of men, not concerned in it, yet ab- sorbed, interested in the play, not at all in the persons. The friend of Mrs. Benson, the midnight mate of young gardeners, dis- turber of high ladies  comfort, serene con- troller of Wanless she was, it would seem, all things to all men, as men could take her. But now she had the fell look of a cat, the long, sleek, cruel smile, the staring and avid eyes. A cat she might be, playing with her own beating heart, patting it, watching its throbs. These moments of witchcraft gazing were not many. They had been deliberately be- gun and were deliberatelydone with. With- in their span her cares were faced and co-ordinated; and the business over, she sighed and sank more snugly into her chair. She leaned back; her hands crossed them- selves on her lap; she shut her eyes. All the lines upon her face softened, melted away. She looked now like an Oread a- swoon in the mid-day heats, pure of thought or dread or memory. Her bosom below her laces rose and fell gently. She slept. Outside in the gusty dark was one who padded up and down the grass on noiseless feet, passing and repassing the window, with an eye for the narrow chink of light.  She slept fora very short lime. Towards ten o'clock she awoke. Collecting herself luxuriously, she was seen to face her facts again. Evidently they held her eyes wak- ing; they were dreadfully there, still unre- solved or still unpalatable. Before them now she plainly quailed. The flush of her sleep gave delicacy to hercarven beauty: she looked fragile and tremulous; it would seem that a little more pity of herself would bring her to tears. As if she knew it, she took her measures, rose abruptly, and, after two turns al tout the room, went to a safe, opened it, and plunged herself into the ledger-book which she took from it. Upon that and a Rest Harrow cash-box with certain involuntary pauses, in which her eyes concentrated and stared  she remained closely engaged until half- past eleven. At that hour, having ascertained it, she put by her work, went into her 1  edr  mm, and began a deliberate and careful toilet. She was pale, serious, and evidently rat her sea red at herself; she lilted her eyebrows and op- ened wide her eyes. But she did what she had to do as daintily as ever Amina in the Arab tale fingered her rice. A person of great simplicity, who did extraordinary things in an ordinary way, at the hour when all Wan less was going to bed, she brushed and banded her shining hair, and dressed lierselt in silk and lace as for a dinner party. To herself in the glass  lie gave and received again a face of pure pity and sorrow. She saw herself lovely and love worthv, sleek un- der the caress of her own beauty. Vet she knew exactly what she was about to do and how she would do it, and did not falter at all. At a quarter past twelve her summons came a knock at the door, the turning of the handle, the push to open, anti Ingram's voice.   Come along, Sancie,  he said, and went away without any more ceremony. She got up from her chair, put her book down, having marked her place, and fol- lowed him after a few minutes  meditation. Ingram s quarters were on the ground tloor of the house, as hers were, but in the oppo- site wing. She had two rooms in the west- ern arm of the E; the whole of the eastern was his. He was at table, when she came in and shut the door behind her at a table fairly naped, with fine glass, silver, and llowers upon it. There was hothouse fruit, too: a melon, a little pyramid of strawberries in fig-leaves. He w as eating smoked salmon and bread and butter with appetite. By his side, half empty, was a champagne glass. A pint bottle stood at his elbow. lie hailed her gayly with a jerk of his head, a   Come along,  and a lifted glass. Leaning back as she came on, watching and waiting for her, he stretched out his left arm. She smiled rather conventionally, did not meet his eyes, but came within reach. His arm encircled her and drew her in.   Well, my girl, well   he said, glancing up, laugh- ing, tempting her to laugh. She looked down gently, blushing a little, and conde- scended to him, stooped and brushed his forehead with her lips. Condescension ex- presses her act. It was exai tly done as one would humor an importunate child, excuse its childishness, and grant it its desire of the moment. So il must have been felt by him, lor there was a sharp, short tussle of w ills. She would have had him contented but he was not so to be contented. There was a little struggle, much silent entreaty from him, nun h consideration from her above him- hcr doubting, judging, discriminating ev es; her smile, half tender and half simple; but in the end he kissed her lips the more ar- dently for their withholding. Then he al- lowed her lo sil by the table, not far off, and resumed his smoked salmon and his zest. She declined to share the meal; was neither hungry nor thirsty she said.   Have your  iwn way, my dear,  he com luded the matt h;  vou'll feel all the better for it, I know.   She cupped her chin in her hand, and watched the play of knife and fork, her thoughts elsewhere.  Now, Sancie,  he said presently in his visual direct manner,  how long is it since I ve seen you   She answered at once, without looking up,   A year and ten days.  He shook his head.  That's loo long. That's absurd. I don't like that kind of thing ;is a man domestically inclined. But I ve been a devil of a way. 1 wrote to you  from where    ' From Singapore,  she told him.  So I did. I remember. Hut I went to Egypt before that. First-rate place, Egypt. I know it well, but am always glad to be there. Fine river of its own. We went to Khartoum and two marches beyond. Then Singapore and the Straits Burmah, Cey- lon; then India. Didn t I write to you from India      Yes,   she told him. She was balanc- ing a salt-spoon idly on a wine-glass and seemed scarcely lo listen. 1 le rattled on.  Had great days in India.

I'm sure you were very happy.  156 Rest Harrow He looked at her directly. " Oh, I was, you know. Otherwise, I guess I should have written. 1 was idiotically happy. And you     I was busy,  she told him,   idiotically busy.  He laughed lightly.   That's one for me and a shrewd one. Oh, you deep-eyed scamp  Sancie, you never give yourself away. I ve noticed that many and many a time. And not I only, 1 can assure you. Bill Chevenix, now-  Her thoughts, her regard, were faraway from a world of Ingrams and Chevenixes. She may have heard, but she gave no sign. He rattled on.  Oh, you re splendid, of course you re splendid.

You know me just as I know you. There s a confidence, a certain- ty about you. That s what s so splendid. There can t be a girl in the world like you.  He clasped her in triumph.  My Sancie  Back I come at the end of my time, and everything s in apple-pie order. And, to crown all, there's you at the door to wel- come me and wait your turn and wait your turn. Always the same my wise, fine Sanchia   He leaned forward, picked up, and held her hand.   My dear, I love you,  he said, and jumped up and kissed her. Then, as he stood above her, the trium- phant young man, with the hand of posses- sion on her shoulder,  Upon my word,  he declared to the assembled universe,   this is a very satisfactory world, so far as I am con- cerned.  When he was seated again and had in- vited her to talk domestic affairs, she re- turned from her reverie and gathered in all her self-possession. The estate, the house- hold, the parish, the county: there was no mistaking his interest in these matters. He was interested in the smallest particulars: her broods of young chicks, her pigeons, the tabby-cat s kittens, the rector s baby. He asked searching questions. How many cows were in milk just now; when would Menzies have asparagus fit to cat   The servants  was all well there  Their young men  Nothing cscaped him. She was quite ready for him, took a dry tone, showed a. slight sense of the humor of the situation, de- scended to trifles, had statistics at her fin- gers  ends. She met him, in a word, as he wished to be met, as jointly concerned in these minute affairs. He lit a cigar and drew her to the fire. He would have had heron his knee, but she would not. She sat on a straight chair be- side his easy one, and allowed him to play with her hand. He talked now in jerks, between puffs, of his adventures: his first shot at a tiger, some trouble with hillmen at Peshawur, a row at a mess-table, in which two chaps lost their heads, and one his papers. He had been present as a guest, but had kept well in the background. There had been a lot of drink- ing done luckily he was all right. He had a good head, you see; could carry a lot of stuff. He had, by the way,  picked up  that little Mrs. Wilmot on board ship. She was coming home in the convoy of Mrs. Devereux. Of course, he had known Mrs. Devereux for years; she was an institution. The little Wiimot person was a widow, it seemed. Niceish sort of young woman; knew the Trenchards up here, was a kind of cousin of Lady Trenchard s. In fact, she was going on to them from here; but not due for a week or so. She had, you might say, asked to be asked or spelled for it out of those eyes of hers. You get awfully friendly on board ship, you must know. You can say anything and do most things  oh, all sorts of things  He had no objec- tion to her coming, he meant; indeed, he rather liked the young party. He thought Chevenix did too. But Chevenix was very much at Sanchia s disposal:   he talked a lot about seeing you again, my girl.  To meet him again might carry her mind back  how long  Eight stricken years. Was it possible that she he and she had been here together eight years  Yes, he could see that she remembered. Dear, sweet Sancie  There was bravado here on his part, and nervousness to be discerned beneath it; for it is most certain that her reverie was not exactly as he would have it. Her chin was in her hand, her caught other hand lay idle in his own; her eyes were far-gazing and sombre; her smile was bleak. Whatever Rest Harrow she heard, whatever she thought of, she be- trayed nothing. Her brooding calm spurred him in that sensitive spot whose throb or ache tells a man whether he is centre of a woman s mind   r not. He must know whether she was glad to have him back: the Wanderer Returned, eh  She had not told him so yet, he must observe; no, nor looked it. She was mysterious, il seemed t   him.   And you can speak with your eyes, my dear; none better. Your tongue was never very loose; but your eyes  Now, you know what you can do with them, Sancie; you know very well. Speak to me, then, my dear, speak to me. Speak to me only with thine . . . no, not only  You can speak in a thousand ways with your hands, with the tips of your fingers placed here or there, with a bend of the head on that lovely neck you have, with your faint color, with your quick- breath. . . .  Fired by his own words, he worked him- self into enthusiasm, was enamored of what himself proclaimed.  My beautiful my goddess   he called her, and drew her to his heart. And she allowed him, allowed herself to be pressed there, while within her the dull lire smouldered, and the deep, slow resent- ment gathered like clouds about the sun. Hut he held her face now between his two hands and forced to meet his own her unre- sponsive eyes; and when with ardor he had kissed her grave lips, the flippancy of a fool ruined him, and his triumph was flattened into dust, as when one crushes a puff-ball. He suddenly held her at arms  length as he was struck by an idea. "Oh by the way, I forgot,  he said, and looked vaguely across the room.   Claire is dead.  Sanchia s eves concentrated and paled. The pupils of them were specks. She paled t   the lips, then slowly flooded as with a tide of sanguine. She withdrew hersell Irom him; simply dropped him off her. She said nothing, but she watched him steadily, while within her the masked lire gleamed and 111- fully leaped. Bravado made him hold on to his airy tone.   She died, I m  old, a I Messina, s  'mi- nute in March. 1 heard ii at Marseilles. Met a man who told me. Yes  She s dead   and buried.  Sanchia had nothing to say. She looked, however, towards thedoor nnd hedetei led that. Her silence spread about the room, caught him and enveloped him. That she was calculating how long it would be be- fore she could escape bv that door was ab- solutely e I ear, and the frost of her silence struck flow n upon him so thal he could not gainsav her purpose. He paused irresolute, glancing askance at her directed eyes. Then he gave in, left her, opened the door for her. She went out, folded in her own mystery; but as she went by him he caught up her hand and kissed the lingers. They were very cold and made him shiver.  Good-night, my clear,  he said, all his dash gone out of him. She said good-night very simply and went away. He looked after her until she had turned the corridor, then went to the table and poured himself brandy and soda-water, drank deeply, and set down the tumbler with a crash.  By God  1 am a fool   he told himself. From the garden that narrow chink of 1 iht which shone through Ingram s shutter was seen to collapse by one w ho w atched it. Shortly afterwards, that same haunterof the dark saw a shining slit part the shutters of a window in the w est wing, and sighed short and quick. He returned to prowl among the secret flowers.

ALL IN A DAY S RUN By William Hamden Foster II.LUST RATIONS BY THE AUTHOR HE yardful of locomotives lay for the most part silent, ex- cept for the sputtering of an uncertain safety-valve or the occasional clanging of a bell as an engine moved drowsily forward in the afternoon sun to the   w-ater- plug  or coal-eliule. Some engines had gangs of greasy wipers polishing cross-head or side-rod. A big H iS stood over the ash- pit while a grimy man crawled between her drivers and banged and poked away at her ash-pan, amid clouds of steam and hot cinders. As I moved down the line of iron steeds purring contentedly, 1 came upon the engine I wras looking for, No. 8000, a big Atlantic- type flyer, and crouched upon the connect- ing-rod and probing into her link motion with a long-nosed oil-can was Windy, one of the crack runners of the road Windy, the man who takes eleven Pullmans ninety- six miles in an hour and forty-six minutes. He got down and came back to the gang- way.   Climb up,  he said, looking at his watch;   we ll have to be going in a minute or two.  I climbed up and found the fireman sprin- kling down the coal.

This mill steams like a fire-engine, though, so I guess we ll get there all right.  Windy took his oil-cans and went over to the round house for his allowance of oil for the run, while the fireman turned his attention to  he fire. The safety-valve sputtered and then popped with a roar. The fireman left the fire-box door open and came  nd looked out the gangway. A little, slim old man with a ragged jumper and a dirty golf-cap, and who needed a shave sorely, was carrying half a bucketful of rivets over to a turn-table that was being repaired.

He lighted his pipe. glanced out of the window, dropped the reverse lever down into the corner, and reu  lied for the throttle. The fireman gave the bcll-rope a pill, and soon, with her con nee ting-rods clanking and her scvcntv-six-inch drivers banging over rattling switches, the 8000 swung through the lines   f locomotives. As we would go by an engine, her driver would wave to Windy from the call or from beside the drivers, and s lout something and grin. Now we were on a trai k about at ri ht an- gles to the one on wliii h I had found the So00. W ith a groan ol the brake-shoes she stopped just beyond a switch, guarded by a dwarf signal.  All right,  said the fireman as lie gave the bell rope another pull. The reverse lever t ame over.    indv leaned out of the window, and semi we were rattling and booming out on tin- main line. Under bridges we swept and through short tunnels, in w hit h thecxhaust of the en- gine sounded hollow and uni army. Apart- ment houses flanked the track on either side.

Then with clanging bell the Sooo bat ked clown on the blind baggage of the train that stood wait- ing and vv hit h the passengers were already boarding. A man with a hammer made the coup- ling. and s. on the little whistle beside the engineer's seat sounded shrilly. Windy ap- plied the brakes. It whistled again, and lie released them.

Windy went up on the front of the engine to change the train numbers in lie headlight. Then they stood talking until the signal dropped at the end of the train-shed.   Trot along. W indy,  said the conductor as he started back toward the first vestibule. Windv 1 limbed, the steps, and the 8000 started ahead, shooting up heavy-artillery exhausts that swirled and churned in the roof of the train shed. The throttle came open a little wider and the reverse lever came up a little nearer the centre. Now the .Sooo was rattling over switt lies and under signal-bridges at a merry rate. As we go: out of the yard limit the fire- man got down. "Vou can have the seat all to yourself now," he said;   I ve got something else to tl. 1.  Then he opened the fire-box and began to apply that science ol keeping up stenm on a heavy, fast train. Jusl then we over- took a freight pulling slowly out on the next tratk. We lore by the caboose and along the line of jolting cars. Apparently they might well have been standing still or even going backward. Then we tame to the engine a big compounder. The fireman stepped Lo the gangway. "Come on," he yelled; but we were by, and only got an answering grin Still we could hear the exhaust of the compound above the par of our own engine. Windy nodded toward the freight. I can t help it; I can t help it; I can't help it," he shouted, in imitation of the ac- cented first and even three exhausts of the freight engine. We were now several miles out and trav- elling at a lifty-mile gait.

Suddenly W indy, w ho had been riding with his left hand resting loosely over the- top of the reverse lever, and his right  irmly grasp- ing the window frame, reached over and shut off. There being no scheduled stop thereabouts, 1 looked ahead for the cause. The train was on a big c urve, and w as run- ning smoothly and fast. The fireman looked up, gave the lire a little repairing.

I got down and went over to the fireman's side as we rolled into the All in a Day s Run Junction. With the squealing of exhaust ing brake-cylinders the 8000 came to a stop. Wind - got down and. with oil-can and wrench, made a hurried detour of the en gine. He had just reac hed the call again w hen the conductor gave the signal, and the Sooo was again on her wav.  ust outside the Junction we met the East hound ex- press. The crews greeted each other as they passed.     lo it. Pop,  said Windy half to himself, as he reached for the whistle, "you re two minutes late." He w histled   grade c rossing,  and waved to the fat man with the yellow tlag in the road. Soon he whistled again on a c urve through a rocky cut, and shut off the steam. His left hand rested on the air Brake until we dashed between the white fences, and then the throttle came open again. "He always shuts off there,  said the fireman. "East spring he hit a baker cart killed the baker and the horse, and smashed the cart to kindling wood. They said there was cake and pie all over the en- gine. Never runs through there now like he used to." "We had a close c all one day at a grade- crossing back in the Hill. We were about thirty yards from it and  lusty on Eighty was just the other side and coming some too. All of a sudden something brown shot out by the boiler like a big jat k-rab- bit thought it was for a minute but il was onlv a feller on a moter-cycle, and lie was surely leanin' some.   After going through a few more small towns, over bridges, under bridges, and through isolated freight yards, we ap- proached the citv. Now suburban trains loomed out of the gathering dusk and with a twinkle of the headlight w hisked by. Sig- nals became more numerous, and the lire man stood in the gangway and ket it look- out. After going under several bridges   lose together, and through a short tunnel, we skimmed around a big 1 urve and came in view of the dark, sombre train shed in the- distance, behind 1 louds ol escaping steam and volumes ol blai k smoke. "All right,  said the fireman. "All right,  said Windy. " All right on W.  "All right on W "All right all the way in.   All right in." The .Sooo was now rumbling into the shed, her safety valve roaring. Within ten feet of the bumper her pilot came to a stop, the reverse lever 1 ame into the bai k corner, and Windy looked over and laughed. "Well, we re here again," he said. Soon after a switcher took our train out and we followed them .1 way, then swung off to the round-house. It was now quite dark, and the net work of rails caught the reflection of a thousand light: red, w hite, and green. Trains moved to and fro, and engines backed in and out with clanging bells. We left the .Sooo in the hands of the hostlers and started over to the round- house.    n the way we passed one of the River Division  Iraballs limping in on one side with a broken connecting-rod. both W indy and the fireman hurled over some remark about crews who let their con net t- ing-rods break. " Every time 1 see a broken connecting- rod I think of one time when I was tiring for Redney," said Windy. "We had the mil v   lacket vou c   ul  I call an express 011 t he North Branc h.     11 c- morning while we were hitting the grit through one of die small towns the side rod  '11 my side broke and the ends went  round like a couple o  Mails.

THE HERMIT OF BUBBLING WATER By Frederick Palmer I LI VST RATIONS- It Y F. C. VOTIN SMALL portable house for living quarters and work- shop combined, a long shed sheltering two aeroplanes, and the poles stretching a Marconi web threw their lone shadows across the Nevada desert. At this central station Danbury Rodd was in touch with substations, which spread zones of llight from the Mexican border to the Selkirks in British Columbia. Yesterday a squall had hung the Idaho man s machine on the limbs of a scrub pint- near the timber line of a peak, and the Arizona man s machine, caught by a  hot ball of wind,  had turned turtle among the cacti. Tell them to cheer up and not to forget to mail full details of the action of the gyro- scope attachment,  he bade the operator.  ' Hello  A visitor   he added, as his rest- less eye saw through the open door an object the size of a fountain-pen cap rise out of the line where the metallic, pebbly sheen of the sands and the velvet depths of the sky met. " From the way he is riding," said Walker, the local assistant, looking through the bi- noculars,   it must be a case of a hurry am- bulance call for an aeroplane.  Here the wireless began to sizzle with good news from the Spokane man. He had been slightly frost bitten, but had found again the same constant wind by certain passes, which was another promise of regu- laritv of service for the proposed two-day special fast mail route fifty cents for an ounce between New York anti Seattle. "Tell him he will have the new electric heated wind shields in a few days, and he ll be as comfortable as if he were riding in a Pullman,  Rodd said, and turned to a study of the big ledger of records, in which he was immersed, when he heard a skurry of hoofs before the door. A young man, in accentuated cowboy rig, threw his leg jauntily over the saddle pommel as he reined his horse skilfully to an abrupt stand-still and addressed himself to Rodd with a directness which completed the im- pression Of haste.   My name s Ed Kimball.  he said,   and I wouldn t have come if I hadn t heard how good-natured you are. You can do me the biggest kind of a favor in a matter of lifeand death but this explains." He passed over a telegram which he ex- tracted from the breast pocket of his blue shirt, where he had anchored it with a wadded red silk handkerchief.  Eyes opened,  Rodd read.  Sick. Want to see you while I am alive. Hurry.   Signed   Uncle Peter.    I don t know how to tell you, except I feel I ve got to see Uncle Peter before he dies,  Kimball went on,  and it s plain there s no time to lie lost. lie lives in the south-eastern corner of Wyoming,on a ranch he calls Bubbling Water, and it takes two days  switching back and forth by rail, and two days more on horseback to get there.    Yes, said Rodd, mechanically, hisdaily trip over the Sierras in mind. He was used to ruses which had a flight in the Falcon as an object. The number of dying relatives who could not be reached promptly by train was astonishing. He studied the telegram. It was written on a routine form and seemed genuine. He looked sharply into eyes which were of a mild blue, at once good-natured and frank.   Come in,  he said, leading the way past the cots of the living-room to the chart - room, where Kimball saw, on a linen-back sheet across a table-top. a section of the Rocky Mountain region in relief. This told the storv of the soundings for reefs, shallows, and drifts in a new world of travel; of the work of a pathfinder in ana- lyzing and surveying the atmosphere. The barrier of a continent s backbone did not end with the summits of the passes which the early explorers had found for the ar- gonauts. It rose heavenward against the westward progress of the empire of flight 167   My God  Look in there  M he cried chaotically. Page 171. with all the meteorological uncertainties lying between the desert regions of the pla- teau and the garden of the Pacific coast; with all the climatic differences of Sierra snows and burning, arid levels, of orange groves and frosty cattle ranges. The cryptic figures in ink peppering the map wavy with isobars and isotherms  were references to the air-movements of valley, desert, and gorge. Geometric tal- 168 isrnans indicated the dependable, known conditions at certain altitudes, and ques- tion marks the vaster field of the unknown. l' Now, here we have south-eastern Wyo- ming,  said Roddj as he drew the sheet over the rollers. He measured the distance straight across the desert to the Rockies, where the calli- pers moved slowly in zigzags and curves among the heights. Then he pencilled a The Hermit of Bubbling Water 169 loop with the desert station as its starting and finishing point.   All right,  he concluded.   I ll be ready in five minutes, and we will he there early in the afternoon, barring unforeseen weather conditions.    Say, you re just like what I heard you were   Kimball said demonstratively; but this testimony to the solecism of fame living up to its reputation was lost on its object, who was already out of the door, followed by Walker. Kimball stopped to dispatch a note back to Reno and to unsaddle and picket his horse. While the rigid gossamer fabric of the Falcon was drawn out of the shed, Walker, a sardonic if efficient man, who knew the mining world and its characters well, had something to say about Kimball.   Think of your dropping into old Peter Hallowell s affairs in this way   he ex- claimed.   Peter is a character. When he made a fortune at Cripple Creek it didn t mean suites in New York hotels and French tonneaus, but the right to the perfect seclu- sion of the plains which the purchase of five thousand acres would ensure. The only known kin he s got in the world are two nephews, and this telegram may not be very good news to George Prather.    George Prather   Rodd repeated, as if trying to recall where he had heard the name before.   Hasn t he one of our ma- chines  Didn t he call on me here once when I was away     Yes. Prather wasn t content with the fastest automobile on the desert, and now he has a plane down at his Long Hike Camp. He made a lot of money out of Long Hike, and, naturally, Peter rejoiced to see that one of his nephews was going to amount to something. Meanwhile, the old man had given Kimball every chance. But all Ed s tastes ran to chased gold spurs and Mexi- can saddles. He s known from Butte to Tucson. Among other things, he tried be- ing an actor for a while, but they said he couldn t act as well on the stage as off it. Peter cheerfully paid Ed s bills till the up- shot of his swaggering was that he killed his man down at Strongbovv. Then his uncle disowned him and told him never to cross the threshold of Bubbling Water again. Some say it was cold-blooded murder. You wouldn t think it, he looks so mild. How- ever, his friends got him off on the ground Vol. XLVII. 19 of self-defence. Since then I haven t heard much of his escapades. He seems to have disappeared from the camps.   So, so   mused Rodd, engrossed in his inspection.  But Uncle Peter must be a fine, sturdy sort to have no illusions on the brink of the dark waters and to be so crisp about it. I d like to meet him. I suppose Prather is the good nephew    Yes, very good,  Walker proceeded, speaking out of the comer of hismouth with an extra accent of cynicism.   That Long Hike mine, which raised him so in Peter s estimation, turned his head. It set him on a mad career of extravagance and specula- tion. He s just as anxious to be known as the boss promoter as Kimball was to be known as the gay desperado. He s the kind that lays a thousand on the turn of a card at faro and slips his two-carat diamond ring in his pocket and talks like a bishop to a party of Eastern capitalists. They say he is in pretty deep. All his credit is staked on being his uncle s heir, and it s been gener- ally accepted that he is to get every cent and that the old man can t last long. But there s no telling about Peter. His eyes are open, he says. What to, I wonder     Kimball will soon know,  said Rodd.  It grows more interesting.    Well, maybe it does,  assented Walker, grudgingly.   Still, if I were you I d keep a lookout on this flighty gun-player. He s dead broke, and I guess it isn t affection that s hurrying him lo Bubbling Water.  Kimball, radiant with the prospect of the journey and speaking his gratitude for the favor, now reappeared, a just perceptible swagger to his steps in keeping with the slant of his puncher hat over his ear; and Rodd, surveyinghim more critically through the glass of Walker s warning, and in light of the fact that he had killed a fellow human being, indicated the forty-four calibre revol- ver slung from the hip with a significant glance.   Are you going to lake that piece of hard- ware with you   Rodd asked.   It does make more weight. I never thought of that,  agreed Kimball, starting to draw the holster from the belt. His readiness to part from the weapon was tinged with a shade of half-juvenile rueful- ness far from sinister.  I m depriving my bad man of some of his artistic make-up,  thought Rodd, now 170 The I Iermil of Bubbling Water smiling over Walker s suspicions. " Its :i 1  - st-in i- i  as ruinous t   the cnscinb c as even- ing dress without ;i tie. Never mind,  he said aloud.   Bring the artillery along.  They slipped Kimball into a wind jacket, and he settled down in the seat at the avia- tor's side. Taking wing, the Falcon r ise little higher than tiie telegraph line, which she crossed as she flew past Reno.   Gee  I thoughtyou went  wav up   said Kimball   This is like skating on stills.    Low when the going is best near the sur- face and when there s nothing to bump on,  Rodd explained. It was the easiest kind of flying that of the first creeping efforts when the flier keeps close to mother earth. No house, no tent, no living thing was in sight, except a man and a burro. The man w aved his hat, the burro turned lii.s head, and both were lost in space over the shoulder. In every direction the sky bounded the eternal hoar-frost of the alkali of a dead world. Ilis course set east, with his ship in the smoothest of seas, there was time for Rodd to think of his companion. Was it really possible that this ingenuous youth, who had an indescribable charm and fresh- ness of manner, had been guilty of man- slaughter  With his gift of drawing the cork to set another s life story flowing, Rndd soon had him talking of the affair at Stroiig- bow.   Why. it was this way,  explained Kim- ball, very simply.  There was a Mrs. Ryan Mother Ryan, they called her and she d been in about every rush from Cari- bou and Dawson to Gold fields. She k.-pt a little restaurant, and had made some money at Strongbow, and I wanted her to keep it, because she was getting old and couldn t hike   ut for another fortune at many more strikes. A slit k fellow bv the name of Hunter was trying to sell her a mine. 1 told her the mine was doped  ;.s I knew it was right before him and every- body. He called me something that made me hit him. The crowd got us apart.  _ f course he went gunning for me. We me in the street that same alternoon, and he fired first yes, he did, Mr. Rodd; there s no doubt about that. Then I tired and he went down, and I g  t this    he indicated a 'Car on the lobe of his ear    and Mother Ryan and the bov  stood bv me, and there wasn t any trial,  he concluded. All the time lie spoke he was looking at Rodd so straightforwardly that no judge in camera could have well refused to accept every word as the truth.  And Uncle Peter   suggested Rodd. Kimball s fathomable, clear eyes lighted with affection in his account of the hermit allowing the interest on his fortune to accu- mulate, while lie saw no one except the ranch boss who lived several miles away and came every day to bring the mail and any supplies that were needed.   Uncle Peter turned on me when he heard about the Strongbow affair. It didn t make any difference that back in the early California clays he had killed a man him- self. And what he said to me when he or- dered me out of his house hurt. I went right off into the mountains looking for a strike, and I d just got back toRenowhen I got his telegram. I don t expect any of his fortune. That will all go to Prather  and I don t need it, I guess. Look at that, will you  There s something I want Uncle Peter to see.  He fished from his pocket a piece of rock in which gleamed specks of free gold.  Two hundred a ton,and mine  And I'm going to develop it myself, little by little, taking my ore for capital.    I should think you would,  Rodd as- sented.   I've been wild as the wildest, I guess,  he went on, emphatically,   and at times I ve pawned everything except my saddle and spurs. I never would let them go, espe- cially that pair of spurs  there s not their equal in the South-west. I m not mean enough, I hope, to be thinking of money when Uncle Peter s dying. What I want is to tell him I ve been right out in the open, away from the camps, playing the game as lie used to play ii, and to prove that I ve made good. 1 ain t laid a dollar on the wheel for four months, and I want him to forgive me to feel that I'm not so bad as he thought I was, and to know I'm going to live dow n my reputation which is a pretty big job, I guess. And 1 tell you, Mr. Rodd, I'll never forget your kindness.     alker is a good aviator, but lie s .1 mis- anthrope about human i haracter,  thought Rodd.  It's love of color and display and budding manhood and  thinking of the quartz  a prodigal who is coming home with his own veal.  The piled masses of the mountains were The Hermit of Bubbling Water 171 developing from shadowy, misty forms t   definite outline, and their bases, set in the nimbus of the horizon, were broadening and sinking. Rodd seemed bent on going over the wall rather than through any gate. Pointing straight for the top of the "first mighty outpost of the range, the Falcon rose on an apron of wind, with the inclina- tion of the shell. The steadily swinging needle of the aerostat noted an altitude of three thousand six hundred when Rodd lowered the guiding planes and began cir- cling the mountain, as if his plan were to girdle it.   You spoke of skating watch this, if we catch that breeze I'm looking for,  lie said. What Rodd called a breeze was a gale. As they passed out of an eddy around a rib into the funnel where it blew, it sent the Falcon aquiver like a sheet of paper tossed out of the window into the wind, and bore her on at incalculable speed through a gap whose sides melted into vast hangings of streaky gray.  Oh  Great, great   exclaimed Kim- ball.  1 like them near like that,  he added, leaning out as they flashed by a jut- ting granite elbow. Rodd saw in his face the light of a never-care fearlessness of which the heroes of charges are made. They slipped over the tops of ridges, to look down on gorges where white-plumed cascades sparkled in the shadows; crept at times against adverse currents; rounded whirlpools; cut their way through the at- mospheric strata of dead spaces as a knife cuts its way through a layer cake; hovered over melting snow to get their bearings; and, tacking this way and that, both aided and retarded by undertows and overtows, they rose to their greatest height to avoid the upward adverse draw of the warm air from the levels, when the plateau of Wyo- ming lay before the eye, a dim carpet of even green tone, rolling in long swells like some storm-weary sea. As they glided through the lower alti- tudes in a broad circle, Kimball pointed out a small, white-painted, single-story ranch house surrounded by young poplars.   There isn t much room to land in the yard,  said he.  You can drop outside the grove and I ll run on ahead, because Uncle Peter s so eccentric I d like to see him alone first. After our last meeting that telegram does seem almost too good to be true.      h, no. I was aiming for the yard al- ready,  Rodd answered.  We ll do it nicely.  He took the pleasure of an expert helms- man in skilfully warping the Falcon dow n- ward toward that small sanded space which was swept as clean as a retired Maine ship- master s lawn. The name of Bubbling Water was evidently taken from the flowing spring in the centre of a weed less little garden, where the tomatoes were showing red against the dark green of the trelliscd vines. Over the door, which was open, ran a climbing rose. A cat sat blinking on die step. But there was no sign of human life in response to the warning hum of the Falcon's cylinders or the settling shadow of her wings. Rodd fell the oppression of the silence. He did not remember ever having dropped in front of any except a deserted house without eyes turned upward in curiosity if not in welcome. Unde Peter must be very ill, he thought, if, indeed, the nephew had not come too late. While Kimball went inside Rodd turned to his machine. He never left the Falcon after a flight without overlooking her as carefully as before as- cending. It was a habit, an affection, with him. Perhaps two or three minutes had passed when Kimball reappeared in the doorway. His face was chalky, his eyeballs starting. With a frantic gesture over his shoulder, he took three orfour tragic steps toward Rodd, as if seeking refuge from some pursuing horror.  My God  Look in there   he cried chaotically.   Uncle Peter s been murdered  murdered bef   re I could see him    Then he became limp; his faculties seemed to be benumbed, his limbs to have lost the power of motion. Rodd sprang past him and onto the step. The house was divided into two rooms. That which he entered was the combined kitchen and living-room. A bright rag car- pet covered the floor. Everything was in order, from the shining pots and pans on the wall to the newspapers in a rack.   n the stove a teakettle sang pleasantly and the lid of a pot throbbed under the impulse of gushes of steam. The cloth was spread on the table and a bowl and spoon were in The Hermit of Bubbling Water place before n single chair Apparently, Uncle Peter had been preparing an invalid s lunch when death crossed his threshold. Through the open door in the partition he saw. King on a cot which evidently the habit of the trail preferred to a bed the still form of the old forty-niner. Entering, he laid his hand on the breast and fell no flutter. The body was still warm. He drew the lids over the slariniT eyeballs and the ghastly effect was gone Irom tin- face, kindly, intelligent, and wan from illness. The impress of Ihe lingers w hich had stran- gled the failing life out ol the body slowed faintly on the throat.    n the collar-bone was an abrasion which might have been made by a thumb nail, bill otherwise no sign of any struggle. A quarter of an hour ago Uncle Peter must have been alive. Who else in that time except Kimball could have been in that isolated Imuse  lather Kimball was the innocent victim of circumstances, whose logic fastened guilt on him, or else he was. indeed, an actor w ho had played an incon- ceivably diabolical part. All W alker's ad- monitions about Kimball were recalled.

And the telegram   lie rec  llected its c in- tents distinctly. Why, when Uncle Peter was in a friendly mood, should Kimball have killed him, without even time to de- velop a quarrel having elapsed  But the telegram might have been spurious, i doc- tored blank taken from a railroad station to sc ure the use ol the Fohou and at the same time proving absence of motive. He lilted the lionv, withered hand w hich had lallen to the floor and laid il beside llie body. Pity tor that k me, friendless hermit, living the harmless life lie chose, struck him ailame with determination lo trace home  he facts as lie hastened out to fmd Kimball standing on the same spot in the same miserable altitude. "How do you explain this   Rodd de- manded. The piercing, resolute questuih- Roused Kimball tumulluously out of his stupefac- tion into a wild appeal.

His sensitive hu- mor could not take the display seriously. Kimball still seemed to him a hoy, over- whelmed by desperation, incapable of de- liberate criire.  If you kill me you ll get away but with two murders to your account, I fear," he said.   At least, there ll be no doubt of your guilt in the second.  Kimball's glance wavered in a contest with steel-grav eyes, chilling and amused in ridicule. " ' ou'd better put up the gun. We are losing lime," Rodd added, in a fatherly wav. Kimball s arm dropped to his side as lie collapsed with a long-drawn breath like a S   1  . " I   I this is the meanest, most coward- ly tiling I ve ever done. It about lits me lor hanging.

"   Mi, that is ii  " he breathed later, as. w ith a lun h. the Falcon   aught a swift current from a defile which the adversary had been riding for several minutes. The spe  k spread to the size of a sheet of note-paper. As it broadened into the lateral sides of a parallelogram en  losing the blots of driver. gas  dine tank, and motor, he recognized the familiar build and knew he was pursuing a machine of his own make whose speed was a compliment to the Falcon as a model, five hundred, f  mr hundrei I yards he lessened the distance, and finally the paradox to the eye of how one line could remain so firruly above the other was explained by the framework of the rods developing out of the pi  lure. As he saw his rival turn his head in inquiry, Rodd waved his handkerchief as a hail, with no answer except unslackened pace. This made him think that Kim- ball s theory was correct. The amateur of the desert, he knew, with a field free from obstacles, developed a speed and a daring for hing distances rarely given ti   those who, under the advisement of weather-bureau signals, followed the safely charted louring courses of the East. Hut more likely some professional, having accepted a challenge, was not yet minded to yield himself beaten. And now the Falcon's guiding planes were dangerously near the circle of a varnished propeller s light, which was their goal. "How am I to capture him   Rodd asked himself. Aerial gymnastics were not yet so far advam ed that an aviator might lie  .lm ked from his seat in the fashion of an eagle who pit ks up a titbit in his talons. The pursuit might have to continue in the hope that it would not be his own stock of fuel which was exhausted first.   At all events, I i an have a closer look," he thought. As he prepared to   liange his course in order to bring the Falcon abeam, the man, alter a quick, apprehensive, backward glance, abruj tly tilted his planes and swung lor a broad opening in the range.

The valley which they entered bad the fair prospect nf a lure. A forest sweep "I cushioned green softened its rugged bottom and the lower j   rti  ms of its stee  , irregular slopes. At first Rodd. still hoping to sig- nal the man of his danger, aimed again to run alongside; but he had lost a good deal of distance in slowing down. When lie- had closed up the interval the eddies out- side of the main draw, whic h they rode at ever-increasing pace, were too uncertain to permit the mameuvre in that path be- coming narrower and its walls higher and more precipitous with every turn. Like a mad shadow of conscience in pursuit of the shadow of a mad spirit, the two planes rounded a monstrous sugar loaf of rock, opening the door of vision to the end of a cyclopean blind alley enclosed by two snow-capped peaks, with a vast white apron in the lap between them. Opposite the valley s mouth, as Rodd remembered, on the relief map at the central station was the one word   avoid,  and over the peaks the meagre but all-sufficient refer- ence "terrific cat s-paws,  taken fmm the Butte assistant s report of a superficial ex- amination charting the spot as out of the question for trails range navigation.

The Hermit of Bubbling Water 177 The wreck, with torn planes fluttering, fell through the calm, frigid lower stratum radi- ated by the ice. I'or the safety of this stra- tum the Falcon dove, as Rodd saw driver and debris half buried in snow. The man came up like a diver and clambered precipitately on all-fours out of the drift which had broken his fall. Ap- parently he was uninjured, for he began flailing his body with his arms to start the circulation. As Rodd landed, he, too, stretched limbs numbed with cold. Then a swift survey of the situation made him think very fast. The adversary was tall, powerfully built, with a bull dog neck and a heavy, florid face. Ilis attitude explained his haste to get firmer footing and an ad- vantage of position. It was one of alert inquiry and physical readiness for any crisis, half threatening. lie thrust his hand suggestively into his wind jacket toward the hip. The look which he gave the Falcon expressed his sinister thought. Here was the one vehicle of escape for both men from starvation in mountain wastes. They might go together, or one might go alone. If, indeed, this giant had strangled old Peter Hallowell, ridicule would not stay his trigger finger as it had that of Kimball. So they faced each other in menacing silence, Rodd wishing for the first time in his life that he was not un- armed. He must depend on another weap- on, and he spoke first, his ear consciously testing his words to make sure of their good humor.   Well,  he said,   it certainly was a great race.   It was,  answered the other dryly, equivocally, as the crackling of ice-sheathed twigs.   When you started up here,  Rodd con- tinued,  I had to accept your challenge.  The man did not answer; he was still grave and watchful.   You are a wonder- ful driver. I never saw anything better,  Rodd persisted, feeling the deceit of his part, but determined to play it none the less thoroughly.   The Falcon can soon be out of this and there s a vacant seat for you.  he concluded, genially nodding toward his machine. This brought his features in sharp profile, which the man identified in a flash of association with portraits in the press.   You re Danbury Rodd, aren t you     he Vol. XLVII. 21 exclaimed, as if that explained the whole proceeding. From all he had heard, it was like Rodd to chase another aeroplane or do any wild thing that came into his head.   I told your works to give me the latest thing and spare no expense- that s my motto and 'twas worth the cost to give you the run I did.  He came forward with im- pressive cordiality, hand extended. Rodd found il disagreeable to take that hand. He was reminded of the marks on Uncle Peter s throat, without any conclu- sive reason yet, as lie warned himself, for thinking that this high-living, extravagant type was guilty of anythingworsethan re  k- lcss love of contest. The man joked about his accident with easy-going fatalism and good-fellowship, while he assisted in drawing the Falcon to the edge of the glacier, where she made her start in a dead space and at an angle from the valley to avoid the draw.   You seem to know instinctively where the good going is,  he said, as they rose safely into a calm area, high over the peaks. Rodd now felt the confidence and stability of the air, which was his element, while glaciers and revolvers were not.   You have my name, but I don t think I have yet thcplcasureof yours,  he remarked with a smile, when he could divert his atten- tion for an instant from his machine.  George Avery. I m a mining pro- moter from Butte,  the man answered, so promptly and naturally that he had either prepared himself for the question or Avery was really his name.  When I picked you up,  continued Rodd,  you were just past a little white ranch house, set in a grove of poplars, quite isolated on the plain.  That gentle approach to the cause of their mad race seemed to awaken no suspicion of its object in his passenger.  Tidy place,  came the easy comment.  I was going so fast I just had a glimpse. In fact, 1 was rushing to Butte to get hold of a big mining proposition I d heard of by wire before another fellow had a chance to land it. Could you take me there, as a great favor  It's not much farther.    Having delayed you, I certainly ought to be willing to run an hour out of my way to take you to your destination. But we will wait till we reach the plain before changing course,  was the answer; and then ITS The Hermit of Bubbling Water back to the mutton with,   you know, T had an idea you rose from the edge of that grove of    oplars.  Rodd was casual hut watching closely for the effect of his words. There was no discerniUe flicker "f self-consciousness in the man's face as he returned: "That s funny. 1 was sailing low and rose just then, 1 guess. I ve oiten been fooled in that wav myself when watc hing a bird. Optical illusion, they call it, don't they "   Either he is a perfect genius in scll- control or no more related to old I e'.er Hallowell than I am    Rodd thought, liis repugnance to Avery, which seemed as in- herent as liis attraction to Kimball, was one thing impelling him straight to the point. "1 stopped at the ranch. I went inside the house,  he said. Their elbows touch- ing, lie felt  he other s frame shiver and saw a glaze in his eye, though those immobile features were still graven as an Indian s.  '1 found an old man dead and his body still warm,  Rodd continued, "and I fol- lowed you on suspicion of murder.

"Chasing me for murder  That's a good one  You re :ill right    and he slapped Rodd on the knee boisterously.  I've got something to tell the boys at Butte." But Rodd had in mind that tremor which had been like the tautness of suspense .set aquiver with a blow.  No, as a matter of dutv 1 am going to take you back lo the ranch. Somebo.lv who is waiting there thinks that you are George Prather, and he can identifv vnu if you arc," Rodd proceeded, thinking it best to keep Kimball s name in the background for the present. The man winced. He regarded Rodd with a hard stare of inquiry, while heseenu'd to be thinking volcanically under the re- pression of his will. Gradually his expres- sion grew soft. I Iis words were softer.   es, Mr. Rodd. 1 have been deceiving you,   he began, as if asking for a full hear- ing before judgment were passed. "Mv name is George Prather. When 1 went to see my uncle to-day I found him dead in his bed. I have a cousin, a worthless young desperado, who was disinherited after kill- ing a man in cold blood. He is bitter against me, and I have many enemies, as success always has. As I was the dead man's sole heir, I knew what they d say. 1 knew I could prove myself innocent, but my business affairs were such that I couldn t stand the scandal. Probably I was a fool i a any rate, I followed my first impulse. I fled. Come, now, keep my secret   He slipped his hand back onto Rodd s knee ingratiatingly, and Rodd noticed through the loose glove the imprint of a large diamond. Its facets might explain the abrasions on Uncle Peter s collar-bone.   Uncle Peter did not die a natural death. He was strangled and you know how a single thumb mark can prove guilt," Rodd hazarded. Prather s shoulders fell in. His head sank between them, but only for an instant. With an effort he threw it back, his jaw well forward and working nervously as lie re- garded Rodd dumbly.  So help me,  he said at length, with forced steadiness,   here is the whole truth  I had a big suike. There were millions ahead if I had something to tide me over. My unde had money rotting yes, rotting in the bank. I went to him for he.p. I found he had been spying on me. He ex- asperated me with his senile, quavering re- monstrances, and we quarrelled. He told me he proposed to disinherit me- I could go smash and Lie damned.   When 1 thought of that worthless, brain- less gun-player Kimball getting all that wealth to spend on gold spurs and his friends, and when I saw the whim of tie old man s dotage and I d depended on him  standing between me and all my plans, I went mad. I shook him as you would a c hild that drives you into a temper, and the spark of life went out of him. He was dead there before my eyes dead a few days be- fore he would have died, anyway. And that money was mine by right by the right of having expected it: by the right of know- ing how to use it. Big fortunes have been built on worse deeds than this  The thing is done. Uncle Peter is dead. Nothing can recall him to life. As a man of the world to a man of the world, I ask you not to let a lit of anger that blew out an expiring flame be my ruin   The Hermit of Bubbling Water 179 He was eloquent, after a certain ghastly fashion, in his appeal. Rodd listened grimly and carefully, but he drew away from the speaker in natural revulsion,convinced that the second version was no more honest than the first.  "No,  he said.   We are going back to the ranch.    We l: see   Prather ripped out. Iii s savage look spoke the same message -  It s you or 1  that it had on tlie glacier, as with one hand he tore open his wind jacket and with the other seized his revolver. Mindless of everything except lo disarm his adversary, Rodd catapulted his whole weight toward Prather s wrist. The Falcon rocked with the struggle which pitched both out of their seats. Rodd fully expected that she would turn turtle, but miracu- lously the vacillating centre of gravity of their combined weight did not completely overthrow that of the machine. He felt the pressure of the strong hands getting a grip of his neck. protected by his military collar. He felt his breath going; he saw red waves blotting out the landscape; and crushing the wrist into the angle between two braces, he forced the lingers open and a glittering streak fell from their grasp. With a twist of his body in his effort to es- cape strangling, he shook himself free, and on his knees, gasping, he met the glare of the man prostrate   n the foot-rcst under him. Then he realized that one or the other had struck the lever of the lifting plane and the Falcon had been steadily rising.   Now you will come without any further resistance,  he said, watchfully. The flush of conflict passed out of Pra- ther s checks. His lips were t.vo gray lines, his nostrils pumping with exhaustion. The pupils of his eyes centred in a stare at a Nemesis which he would deny and yet could not.  No  My God to think that you, the one man who could catch me, should have happened along   he breathed tensely.  No  To face that and bankruptcy   No   He closed his eyes, and with a sudden wrench of anguish, in which desperate bra- very seemed to flaunt desperate fear, before hispurpcse was designed, he threw himself free of the framework. Rodd extended a saving hand to the empty air. lie glanced toward that dark object falling through space, two thousand feet above the peaks, and looked away in horror, and looked back again to see a thing scarcely larger than a ball strike on a shelf of rock and bound out of sight in the depths of the gorge. Already his rapid flight had carried him far past the spot. There was no place to land if he should return. A s.atue with mechanical arms and legs, he drove the Falcon back to Bubbling Water. When he lighted in the yard there was no sign of human life. The water nf the spring was flowing merrily; the cat had changed its position to the walk to get the benefit of the slant of the descending sun. Had Kimball broken his word and fled   If so, it was without his revolver, which lay where he had thrown it. Entering the house, Rode saw him sitting beside his uncle's body; and as he looked up in inquiry and rose to his feet with a certain sober and becoming dignity, Rodd, fond of proving his faith in human nature, dccidcd suddenly to gratify his interest in this young man by a supreme tesl. So he said, with an assumption of weariness:   A wild-goose chase of live hundred miles to find that the man s name was Avery.  Kimball did not avert his steadfast gaze from Rodd at the news. In his transparent way he showed his realization of its mean- ing to him. Then he stiffened.  When I saw Untie IY-fcr lying dead I was struck dumb,  he declared, his voice trembling with a new quality. "When I found his body still warm, the thought that I should be accused staggered me. That reputation which I had hoped to live down would be all against me. Instead of having him forgive me, 1 should lie known as his murderer. I turned a selfish coward. 1 went nit of my head and rushed into the yard, not knowing what I s: id or did. But now I guess I m out of the Nick Carter and the kid stage for good, and I'm ready to give myself up. I know I am innocent, even if I can t prove il.   That and more than that is proved,  Rodd said beaming, as he put his hands fondly on Kimball's shoulders. . . . Kimball listened w ithout comment to the account of Prather s death, and after a silence he observed sadly:  The hard part for me is that Uncle Peter never understood how I had been makirg good these last few months.

TWO SONNETS By Antoinette Rotan Peterson TAORMINA Tm: ancient town hangs up a crag s steep breast, Between the tideless. shimmering, jewelled sea And many colored sky of Sicily, As some old griffin crouched might rear his crest Of wrinkled scales and look toward the wide west, Where, big in flaming, golden apogee, Beyond far fields of pale rose almond tree, The sun leaves .Etna and the world to rest. On the Greek theatre night falls; old wars, Dim glories gone, and far-off pagan woe Flit through the wanderer s dream; now come the stars To watch the magic mountain weave and sow His grape-bloom mist, and hide his lava scars, And veil his head in amethystine snow.

REMINGTON S REGENT WORK THERE are anecdotes in the history of art, episodes, or fragments of talk, which in illustrating the point of view of an individual also throw light upon whole   movements.  It has been told of Ingres that when, in the streets of Rome, he de- tected the approach of some crippled or otherwise repulsive mendicant, he would cover his eyes with his cloak, and some- times, if his wife first saw the unwelcome apparition, she would endeavor with a swift Vol. XLVII. 22 movement of her shawl to save the artist from the sight of ugliness. The story is elo- quent of both the strength and the weak- ness of a temperament known to every age. Again, you may find the key to all poetized landscape in that famous letter of Corot s beloved of painters as an authentic ex- pression of the artist s mood, though, as a matter of fact, he did not write it.

This is not the place in w hii Ii to embark upon a long analysis of American social conditions with special referent e to Western traits, but 1 must pause for a moment on the particular value of those traits in Ameria an painting. In the scan h for the pit turesque theartist is scarcely lobe blamed if he makes much a if costume. There arc sketching grounds in Holland, in Frame, and in the South whose popularity is legitimately enough to be relerred to the dress ol the people. But the step from these places to a room at home.

As we begin to recognize it we are learn- ing, fortunately, that the question ol ms- tunie is not. after all, so prodigiously im- portant. I think Mr. Remington hit upon this truth a number of years ago. At all events when lie vent West and found pict- uresqueiicss lie did not find it or make il an affair of Indians in war-paint and lea 11kts. Before   ilin Warner made his remarka- ble series of Indian portraits in relief the  merit an arti t who Used the red man ,i' a model at .ill was. with lew e.xeejitioiis. dis posed to make him .1 rmiianlii figure after I he litera rv 1 ashi"ii oi 1- cnimore Cooper, or to invest him with a somewhat theatrical significant e. l i.ce.s with the simple 'ill eerily ot  . it. , . Ward ' " Indian Hunter " were rare. Warner s reliefs signalized a newer and saner conception of the one in ten.selv   i' turc'ijue type that had been left t" us all along and that we had foolish- ly sought to conventionalize. W hen Mr. Remington s opportunity came lie faced il from this sculptor's point of view, lie became interested 111 the Indian, 1 gather, bet ,niso lie bei .line interested in life, the a  - live, exi iting li I   ol the plains. I he Indian appe iled to him not in any histrionic wav, not as a ligure  tcp   c I mil in m the pages of  Hiawatha,   but .is j 11 -1 a human creature, sometimes resplendent in the 1 harai ter of a militant 1 liici, sometimes unkempl, ill- smelling, and I  :iths, imelv drunk, and al- ways 1 he member of a 'trmigb individual izciI race, having inu  h to do w ith i uns and horses. Il u 1 mid be stupid to be umrrale- ful for the Indian pit tures which have hap- l.ened to be idealized and have made the red man seem an exotic if not a legendary personage.    ccasiunallv they have been verv good pictures, as witness several of those painted by George cle Iorest Brush. But the tendeiii y. the right leniency, has latterlv been all in the direction which Mr. Remington from the start has followed. He was an illustrator when he began, a " black-and white  man, and,.as it has turned out, lie could not have had a bet- ter preparation Jor his work as a painter. For one thing it lixed his mind on the fact, and trained him in the swift notation of the movement which lies somehow at the   erv heart of wild Western life. Just as the cowboy. in the midst of a hurly-burly of cattle, shouting to his comrade words call- ing for instant action, has 110 time to em- ploy the dit ti-m of 1 lenry James or Gibbon, so the modest illustrator must use a rapid pencil and leave picture-making to take  are of i 1 self. He must get the truth.   ither artistic elements must come later. 1 1 annot think of Mr. Remington as stroll- ing out upon the prairie with stool and umbrella and all the rest of an artist s para- phernalia. nor i an 1 see him in my mind s ev e   ii 'litely requesting Three-Fingered Pete or Young Man Afraid of Ilis Horses to fall into ,111 elTet live pose ;md   look   leasanl.  1 see him instead on the back of a mustang, or busying himself around the camp-fire, or swapping yarns with the soldiers it a fron- tier post, or "nosing round" amongst the tribes. Ii doL's not mtu h matter.in a sense, w hether or nut he put immortal things into his sketi h-bnoks during those first cam- paigns of hi.'. For my ow n part, 1 do not believe that they have the smallest chance oi lasting, save as so manv dicuments. The important thing is not that he failed to draw beautil illv, which is precisely what he tailed to do. but that he got into a way "I draw ing skilful I v and 1 Icverlv, so that he put his subject accurately before you and made you fed its special tang. His suc-   ess was due not only to manual dexterity but t" his whole-hearted response to the straightforward, manlv charm of the lile " hit h by instinct he knew how to share. I make a great deal ol this out-door mood of his, lliis sympathy, bet ause it reacts to this da v upon the purely artistic qualities of liis work.

They are lean, wiry, and mist hievous animals that he paints in such pictures as "The War Bridle." " The Pony 'Pender." "The Buffalo Runners,  and "Among the l.ed Horses.  You observe them with a certain zest. They move as though on springs. Their heels play like lightning over tin  earth. You feel them hurling themselves along in the hunt, going nervously into action to the crai k ot bullets, or struggling not unthoughtfully with the ciiwImiv whii would i imquer their trii kiness. It all makes an exhilarating spectacle, and these pii lures are tilled besides with keen, dry air and dazzling light. The joy of liv ing gets into Mr. Remington's work. I  e cidedlv von cannot think o  it as something apart from his art. It is his di-aim .ion that he has made the tw o one. Partly this is due to the unfailing gusto with which lie throws himself upon his task, the kindling delight he has in his big skies and plains and his utterly unsophisticated people: but a rich source of his strength lies in nothing more nor less than his faculty of artistii observatii  n. Under a burning sun lie has worked out an impressii nism    f his iiwn. Baked dustv plains lead in his pictures to bare, llat- topped hills, shading from yellow into violet beneath cloudless -kies w hich hold no soft tints of pearl or rose, but are tiercelv blue when they do not vi I irate into ti  nos    t green. It is a grim if not actually blatant gamut of color with which he has frequently to deal, and it is not made any the more beguiling by the red hides ol his horses or the bronze skins of his Indians. In past times he has made ii shriek, and. even now. he linc.s it impossible to lend  uavitv to so high a kev. But that, of course, i- prei iseh w hat no one Would ask him to do. What was needed was simply a truer ad iustment of " values" a ni I an impn  vemeiit in the quality of    aintei I surface, and, in these matters, his high- piti lied studies show that lie has made sub- stantial progress. They still make v.  u I din k. but they leave a truer impression, and that Mr. Remington has a far firmer grasp upon the whole problem ot illumination is shown bv the night si enes to w hii Ii I have already alluded. These are both veracious and beautiful, and, as 1 have said, they exert a very original charm. If it were not that repetition is so destructive of originality one might wish that he would go on lor a long time painting only the night. He knows how the light of the moon or of the stars is diffused, how softly and magically it envel- opes the landscape. I find what I can only ,lest ribe as a sort of artistic honesty in these not turn til studies of his. He never sets out to be nunantic or melodramatic. The light lie mi falls in genii msly at  me salient point. Rather does one of his pictures receive us into a w ide world, the boundaries of which, brought closer by the darkness, are still kept awav from us by a coo , quiet, friendly gleam. Especially noticeable about thenight, as he paints it, is the absence alike of any- thing to suggest an artificial glamour and anvlhingindit ativeof heightened s  ilemnity. The scene is wild, but it wakes no fear.    ne is close to the bosom of nature, that is all. The beauty of the painter s motive, too, has communicated itself t   his technique. His gray-green tones fading into velvety depths take on unwonted transparency, and in his handling of form he uses a touch as firm as ever and more subtle. In one of his night scenes,  The Winter Campaign," we have not only the qualities w hit h have just been traversed, but an ex- ceptionally good illustration of that truth- ful painting of the white man in the West which I have mentioned as constituting an important aspect of his art. The military painter has ever been prone to give ear to the music of the hand. How can he help himself  Historv invites him to cele- brate dramatic themes. Thelustof theeyeis bound to lure him where the squadrons are glittering in their harness and the banners are flying. Even when he has but a single ligure to paint he must, as Whistler once said to me oi Meissonier,   put in all the straps and buttons.'  That wav lies disaster sometimes. It was of a militarv picture by Meissonier that I  cgas remarked that every- thing in ii was of steel except the swords.    ne antidote to the artificiality fostered by too great .1 devotion lo a handy wardrobe and a multitude of "studio fixings  lies in the simple process of roughing it with the lori es. It is to be gathered from Mr. Remington s books that he has forgathered The UuiTalo Runners Big Horn Basin. '  v. -        A- '.. . --, '.

The piazza was enclosed with wire net- ting, as were most of the piazzas in Cranston, New' Jersey.  Get in as quickly as you can,  she said, tapping the screen door here and there before she opened it a conservative dis- tance.   The animals are yammering at the bars, and howling for their evening meal.  Warren Dudley squeezed hisrather portly figure through the narrow space, and Miss Ainslee hastily closed the screen door.  How are they   he said. It was evident from the anxiety in his face that he did not mean the mosquitoes which had already settled back on the door, and had begun to explore the netting with their needles. He had taken off his straw hat and was fanning himself with it. Miss Ainslee pushed a deep wicker arm- chair toward him, and sat down in the chair from which she had risen.  Dr. Hinton is upstairs now, so that you will soon have the very latest bulletin; but so far as I can judge, they are both about the same. They are held in statu quo through their anxiety about each other. Frederick w'ill not stop worrying about Eloise long enough to get well himself; and Eloise only stops worrying about Fred- erick long enough to get in a little worry about the new baby and Helen and Doro- thy. If they would think of themselves for a while, it is my opinion that Eloise would begin to get along as well as could be ex- pected, which she isn t; and that Frederick s temperature would soon go down instead of up; and the nightmare of a possible opera- tion would no Longer hang over him. But then,  Miss Ainslee wound up with an air of resignation,  you might as well expect those mosquitoes to change their natures as to hope that what is called a happily married couple w'ill ever have an independent, indi- vidual thought.   Well, if the ' are no worse-  Vol. XLVII. 23 With this hopeful inconclusion Warren Dudley leaned back in liis chair and looked at Miss Ainsleewith the interest and amuse- ment which he felt in spite of his anxiety for his friend, Frederick Curtis. Since Curtis had developed appendicitis, a week before, Dudley had come over from New York ever ' evening to see how he was getting on. That this obligation of a daily call should coincide with Margaret Ainslee svisit to her old friend, Mrs. Curtis, would once have seemed to Dudley the working of a special Providence in his behalf. Twelve years before, when he was in his early twenties, he had been so much in love with Miss Ainslee that it is doubtful if he would have seen either the egoism or the humor of con- sidering the serious illnessof his friend as the foreordained means of a meeting with her. Miss Ainslee had, however, refused to marry him; and had remained in Ohio to teach school while he had gone east to make his fortune, equipped with an almost intol- erable burden of unhappiness. He hadn t made the fortune, but he was no longer un- happy; and he had met Miss Ainslee for the first time after so many years with the mild, archaeological interest of a man who analyzes a past attachment in the present light of an unprejudiced view of the woman. He had seen her, now, every' day fora week, and he had the satisfaction of finding that, even in his very young manhood, he had not been without discrimination. Miss Ainslee, it seemed to him, W as an admirable and in- teresting woman. He liked to think that there had been sound reasons for his love almost as much as he liked to consider that now there was no love in his reasons. It amused him to find that she still felt the an- tagonism toward ma rriage which had proved so fatal to his early hopes,and it pleased him to see that she could still express this an- tagonism with no effect of acidulous spin- sterhood. Her opinion of the mutual sub- jugation of the Curtises had for him rather the charm of a girlish rebellion against the fate of her sex.  How conservative you are, Margaret,  he said, smiling at her. 197 Hostages to Fortune "I  Conservative   Miss Ainslee in- voluntarily threw up her head ;inil lifted her brows. 1  udlev s smile deepened. ' Oh, I'll grant vour licivs are radical enough, hut to hold the same views for twentv years is certainly conservative.  '  Twenty vears  I  iin too conservative to accept Ihul without a demur.   Well. I'll acknowledge that you are as conservative about changing your looks as you are al out changing your views.  She bowed ironically. Her blush bore out Dudley s opinion of her girlish appearance.  If 1 had changed mv views of mar- riage,  she said,  my visit to Eloise, this summer, would cause me to revert to them with renewed ardor. Eloise is a lost soul. She hasn t a single thought outside her fam- ily and her home. She has unusual talent for music, and she was ambitious before she married. But now she never touches the piano except to dust it. She used to read books, real books, not current literature, and she had ideas on what she read; but now she is no more capable of harboring an abstract idea than she is of having a selfish thought where Frederick or the children are concerned. She s as good as gold, and I love her; but she s as primitive as a cave- dweller. That is what marriage has done for Eloise.   It s a terrible arraignment,  said Dud- ley,  but Floisc strikes me as happv.      h, she s happy  That s the worst of it. She has no conception of her degradation.  Miss Ainslee laughed at her own vehe- mence. " And Frederick is happy, too, but I know you wonder that he should be. Vou would die in six months if vou had to go back and forth, every day, between New York and Cranston, New Jersey. Even the few days that you have been coming since Frederick has been ill have begun to tell on vou.    Yos. Tam waning   Dudley cast a glance of mock pity over his long person, which bore easily the additional weight that his thirty-six years were beginning to place upon it; ho looked at his companion with a quizzical smile.  What are you Irving to do  Make me thank you for throwing me over     Miss Ainslee got up and went over to the end of the small piazza where a honey- suckle had been trained on a trellis to in- sure at least privacy of sight; the next house was so close as to render privacy of sound a matter of careful modulation. She stood with her back to Dudley.  You know that 1 am not.  she said with- out turning.  When a woman is frank, a man alwavs looks for her second intention. I don t suppose that men and women will be able to talk together like simple, sincere human creatures until men wake up to the fact that some women, at least, have ceased to consider marriage the be-all and end-all of their existence.    My dear Margaret,  Dud lev eagerly ex- postulated, '  1 know that the higher edu- cation of women in general and your own sweet girl undergraduates in particular are the only sky-scrapers on your sky-line.  Miss Ainslee turned with a smile and came toward him. Her smile was very pleasant, and softened the rather firm lines which her mouth had in repose. Fler fig- ure was straight and slender, but without the flexibility of girlhood. There was the subtle stiffness and primness in il often noticeable in unmarried women in their earlv thirties; but, in the favoring twilight of the July day, she looked young and pretty as she paused in front of her com- panion s chair, and fixed her frank, smiling eves on him.  1 wonder,  she said,  what are your topless towers of Ilium.  Dudley rested his head on the back of his chair and looked up at her. He had a long, rather heavy chin and a high, slightly narrow forehead w ith a delicacy in the mod- elling of the temples. Everything about him, from the way his cravat was tied to the shape of his low shoes, had distinction without foppishness. It was plain that the cut of his clothes was a matter of thought, his own thought, not his tailor s; for, al- though they were evidently fresh from the hitler s hands, they were not of the latest fashion.  I haven't a single tower left, topless or otherwise,  he said.  My life consists of doing things I don t want to do so that 1 may earn money to do things I do want to do. or rather, do things which I am used to doing, for I find that what were predilec-  lions when I was younger arc mere habits now. The only thing that could make my life more intolerable would be lo change it in any particular.  Hostages to Fortune 199 They laughed together at liis paradox. Miss Ainslee's laugh ended in a faint sigh.   Ideals, or no ideals, time lells on us all. It has with me. Sometimes, lately, at the close of a hard day, 1 have caught mvself hating my work, hating even my sweet girl undergraduates; and I know that, next winter, when 1 am abroad, striving to gain the degree which marks the height of mv ambition, there will be times when I shail hate that, too.  They were both silent for a moment, and then Dudley said, with a vague gesture of his hand toward the restricted view com- manded by the piazza,  Do you suppose that Fred ever, at the close of a hard day, hates this   She took in the suburban street; its new, wooden houses in every diversity of bas- tard architecture, each on its little plot of ground, with its new, little shade-trees at the curb.  No, she answered,   Frederic k doteson it. The harder the day, the more he dotes. As I remarked before, Frederick is happy; but you can t understand how lie can be.   Do 1 show my perplexity as plainly as that   Dudley laughed.  I o sit down. Margaret, or 1 shall have to get up, and 1 don't want to. To tell you the truth, to speak as a simple, sincere, emancipated male to a simple, sincere, emancipated female, were 1 Fred, or ninety-nine out of every hundred married men I know, 1 should die of re- morse and terror. To speak with the frank- ness of the ideal man of the future, 1 am thankful, my dear Margaret, that, in my callow youth, you turned me down.  He pressed his hand against his left side with exaggerated gallantry and bowed stilily from his hips. Miss Ainslee returned his bow. He could not make out, in the gather- ing dusk, whether she were nonplussed by liis immediate practice of her theory.  The temerity with which men rush into matrimony appalls me,  he went on.  They acquire a wife and children and a suburban home on a salary barely sufficient fora bachelor. Their salary is theonly thing between their family and the poor-house, and that is dependent on their usually not over-robust health. Most people think that bachelors don t marry because they are too selfish to cut out any of the luxuries that have crystallized for them into necessities; but the real reason is that bachelors have a true realization of the responsibilities and obligations of llie married state. In fact,  he ended wiili a   liange oT toneasif he were a bit embarrassed at having spoken with so much feeling,   bachelors are theonly a ngels extant.  It was plain from the way he had spoken that he had a special case in mind; and M iss Ainslee, being a woman, felt no trep- idation in immediately plucking the per- sonal from the general in which a man pre- fers to discuss his fellow-men.  I can see that you are very much worried about Frederick,  she said.   Yes,  he assented,   I am. 1 am afraid that poor old Fred, upstairs, flat   n his back, staring a possible operation straight in its grisly face, is getting an awful dose of t he rem irsc and the terror of being ma rricd. 1 know that he has a cheerful picture of his family walking over liis grave to the poor- house, Floise with the new infant in her arms, and the two other children clinging to her skirts. 1 le varies this vision bv ha  - ing F.loise die, too, while the children go to an orphan-asy lum. CM course, his tempera- ture keeps mounting.  W arren Dudley suddenly g"t up and be- gan to pace the piazza. " Would it really be as bad as that if any- thing should happen     M iss Ainslee asked with the literalness of her sex.  Perhaps not, exactly.  Dudley paused before her, and looked down at her slim figure, which seemed to hold in its white, crisp draperies the last light of the summer dav.  Hut it would be bad enough. He and 1 get about the same munificent salary from Fields, Weldon and Company, and I just manage to make the two ends of mine meet around mv rooms, my clubs and mv books; so I don t imagine that Fred, with a family and a home to keep up, has saved yen much  '   r a rainy day. There is a poli  y on his life, of course; but there s a mortgage on the house. And there you are.  He turned away and began again to pace up and down.  Oh,  cried Miss Ainslee, springing lip and standing straight and rigid,  it can't be as bad as that. There must be some wav to help. And. anyway, Frederick isn't anv worse than he was. There, at last, is 1  r. Hinton,  she added as steps were heard in the hallway. She went quickly to him as he came out 200 Hostages to Fortune of the house with the evident desire in his decisive  good-evening  of getting off the piazza without any parley.  Oh, doctor,  she asked,  how is Mr. Curtis now   Mr. Dudley, please light the hall light.  In the flare of the gas she tried to read her answer in Dr. Hinton s pale, weary mask. He had stopped at her question with the controlled impatience of a physician. He gave Miss Ainslee s anxious face a quick look, as if lo estimate her nerves, before he replied.  I have sent for Dr. McNaughton. I wish to consult him.   Then you are going to operate  Dr. McNaughton is a surgeon, isn t he     You rush at conclusions, Miss Ainslee.  Dr. Hinton smiled faintly.  Dr. Mc- Naughton is a surgeon; but a consultation docs not necessarily mean an operation. I shall return in about an hour with Dr. McNaughton. I am going to meet him at the Jersey City ferry with my auto to save time. Good-evening.  He ran lightly down the steep wooden steps. Miss Ainslee turned on Dudley.  He is going to operate,  she affirmed al- most angrily. Her tone seemed to accuse him, together with Dr. Hinton, of an eva- sion of the truth.  And it will kill Eloise.   Perhaps,  Dudley said with ironic bit- terness,  since the operation is on Pred, he can manage to die, too. Of course,  he added,  Eloise must not be told about the operation.   Told  Of course, no one will lell her  But she ll know of it, just the same. She probably knows of it already. She and Frederick have a sixth sense, born, I sup- pose, of that terrible, conjugal interdepend- ence; and theycanread each other s thoughts and feelings without a word, or even a glance, passing between them. They only talk to each other because it is customary, not because they have to for the sake of communication. Nevertheless, Eloise will try to get it out of me. She ll try to make me tell her wha: the doctor said. Here comes her messenger now.  A rapid, light step had been heard on the stairs.  Areyou out there, Aunt Margaret   A girl stood in the doorway, peering into the comparative gloom of the piazza. Her figure was silhouetted against the lighted hall. The short dress, long, thin legs, and narrow shoulders were those of a child of about twelve, shooting rapidly out of girl- hood. Miss Ainslee went to her, and, put- ting her arm about her, drew her out on the piazza. The girl s head came well up to Miss Ainslee s shoulder.  Mother wants to see you, Aunt Mar- garet.   My prophetic soul   cried Miss Ainslee with a nervous little laugh. She bent her head and kissed the girl s cheek with sud- den vehemence.  And don t you want to see your Uncle Dudley, Dorothy     Warren came toward the intertwined figures and held out his hand to the child.  Oh, how do you do     She put her hand in his with a shy, pretty, grown-up air.   I d like to see you, but papa wants to see you, too. The nurse said he might.  The nurse was waiting for Dudley at the door of Curtis s bedroom. She was of mid- dle-age, with a short, compact figure, and a shrewd, kind, tolerant expression similar to that often seen in the faces of women who have risen to places of authority in some religious sisterhood.  Do not stay long,  she said.  Mr. Curtis must have a chance to rest before the physicians return.  She stepped aside to let him enter. Her clean, stiff uniform rattled slightly as she went down the stairs. Curtis s bed had been pulled out into the middle of the room, so that he could get the benefit of any breeze that might find its way in through the two small dormer windows. The room was still hot with the stored-up heat of the day. A gas-jet, turned low and shaded by a piece of paper fastened against the globe, added its increment to the heat Curtis moved his head on the pillow and looked toward the door.   Is that you, Warren   he asked.  Come in and make yourself uncomfortable. Ex- cuse me for not rising to greet you,  he went on, as his friend came to his bedside and took his hand.  Well, old fellow,  Dudley said,  you chose good weather to take a vacation. The city has been fiendishly hot to-day.  T. he firm pressure of their hands and the earnest encounter of their eyes expressed the deep friendship neither man could have put in words without embarrassment. Hostages to Fortune 20 J Curtis looked verv longand thin underthe sheet. His dark eyes seemed abnormally large and sunken from the pain he suffered; they were bright with the fever that glowed in two round spots, high on his cheeks.   It's llot exactly the Arctic regions here,  he said.  They keep me packed in ice. but the only effect obtained is on the ice. J'lhit melts. Sit down, Warren.  He motioned toward a chair at the sid:1 of the bed. lie waited until Dudley was sealed l.eforc he said, in a different tone,  I guess I m up against it. The ice didn't do its dutv and relieve the inflammation, so the surgeon is going to do his. Dr. Hinton didn t want lu operate because I have a had heart, and there is danger that it wouldn t weather the ether. The operation rr.av be successful, but I may never come to, to know that it is.   He smiled feebly at his joke.  Hut you don t know that they are going to operate,  Dudley protested,  and if they do, it isn t a foregone conclusion that your heart will give out.   Oh, my dear Warren, don t trv tocheer me up. I'm not afraid. I m not borrow- ing worries. But I ve got to face possi- bilities as if they were foregone conclusions. I ve gat to pretend that I'm going to die. so that 1 can figure out how Eloise and the children are going to live, afterward.  He made a fist of his hand and struck it against the open palm of the other with a nervous emphasis that one could see was characteristic of him. He winced with the pain of the involuntary gesture and let his arms fall at his sides.  1 have five thousand dollars  insurance,  he added after an instant.  1 took it out the year I married, and it has taken about all we could save to pay the premiums. What I did manage to save, over and above that, I put intothis house. I figured that the interest on the mortgage and taxes wouldn t be any more than rent. Well, they aren t; but the question is, how can Eloise keep up the interest and pay the .axes and run the house and educate the children on the in- come from five thousand dollars  Ever sincelknew I had appendicitis I haveaskecl myself that question; and the answer 1 have had to give has made me suffer more than the old, prehistoric remnant in my side has.  He lifted his hand and pressed it tight over his eyes as if his imaginings had sud- denly taken visible and terrifving form and he wished to shut them out.  Warren,  he spoke without uncover- ing his eyes,  don'  ever marry. I used to pity you because vou weren't married; I even thought that I was better than v  u, somehow, because 1 was a husband and a father. Hut l  e been a knave and a cow- ard. I've seized upon the greatest happi- ness a man   .in know; the woman I love has been my wife and has borne me three children; and now 1 go out of the world and leave her to pay for ii all. Why, a drunken brute who deserts his familv is no worse than I am. 1 knew llial Eloise would be almost penniless if I should die; but 1 put the thought behind me and went on being happy. 1 told myself 1 wasn t going to die." A tear ran down his thin cheek. Dudley got up and went to the bedside and laid his hand reassui inglv over the hand which lay outside the sheet.  And 1 tell you, mv dear man, that vou are not going to die; but if it will make you feel any more comfortable, we'll talk as though you w ere going lo die. You wanted to tell me just how things stood, didn't you, so that I would be in a position to advise Eloise  Well, it seems to me that the thing to do is to sell the house and atld the money to the insurance. It ought to nake a tidy little income " Dudley s soothing tone seemed to irritate Curtis. He drew his hand away, uncovered his eves,and looked up with a certain fierce- lie"  That sounds verv line,'' he said.  Hut who will buv the house, and what will they pav for il .J They won t pay what   did, nor near it. I bought when Cranston had its boom; now the boom has gone on t   the next town and people want to buy mere, not in Cranston."  He closed his eyes wearily. The facti- tious strength his lever had given him was almost exhausted.  This is what Eloise must do.  he went on after a moment in a monotonous tone,  and I want vou to help her do it. She knows as mm It of business as the new baby does. She must sell the house for what she can get. She must sell the furniture. She must go back to Ohio and board with her mother.   have no relatives who could help her; and her mother is so hard up that Hostages to Fortune Eloise s money would help her. 1'hat is the milv cheering thought, to a proutl soul, in tin.- whole attair. 1 1 lise's mother lives in a country town. The children will receive the superior education a country town affords. And 111:11all.  Curtis paused with an air of dreary linal- itv. Dudlev looked down at him without  qleaking, and the two friends gazed into each other s eves as tliev had when they greeted each other. Dudley's long, heavy i hin began to quiver, but he forced a smile as he said, with an attempt at lightness,   I don t suppose that you have settled what is going to become of wc without you. You know, I've got sort of used to having you around.  Curtis smiled back at him and held out his hand.   Dear old W arren,  he said. A rustling of skirts was heard in the hall; both men looked at the door, expecting to see the nurse, but it was Miss Ains.ee who entered. Curtis lifted himself halt-way up in bed as he saw her and then sank back with a moan of pain.  Eloise   he cried,  is anything the matter w ith Eloise     Miss Ainslee went quickly toward him, and Dudley stepped back to let her have his place beside the. bed.  The only thing the matter with Eloise,  said Miss Ainslee, smiling down at him,   is that she is getting well too fast. The nurse and 1 had a strenuous half hour persuading her that she wasn t quite chipper enough to come up here to see you. She finally com- promised upon having me come up to see you. 1 come freighted with messages.   Then she knows about the operation    There was a queer mixture of anxiety and relief in Curtis s tone.  The nurse told 11 c 1  No, nobody told her; but you know what Eloise s intuitions are. Her intuitions also extend to your and Warren's confab. She seems to have had a foreknowledge of why you wanted lo see him, and what you have said to him.  Miss Ainslee paused. Her smile jecame rather fixed, and Dudley could sec that she wa-  overwrought and nervous.   lt'  too ridiculous, my dear Frederick,   he went on,  to have to talk to you as though an operation for appendicitis were as conclusive as the guillotine; hut  he messages I bring you must be delivered with that as a premise. Not,  she inter- polated hastily,  that Eloise believes that; hut she says that you do, and that you are worrying about what will become of her and the children; and she wants me to tell you that this is what will become of them: they will go to Ohio and live with her mother and be the wealthiest folks in the town, with the money from the sale of this house and the life insurance. She says that the real country is the only health- ful place to bring up children; but, since Dorothv is so nearly out of childhood," Miss Ainslee hesitated; then she added, with an elaborate attempt at the casual,   Eloise savs that 1 am to take Dorothy and bring her up in the classic atmosphere of my school.  She finished speaking, but Curtis made no replv. He drew his eyebrows together in a puzzled frown.   Do you mean,  he said,   that you are go- ing to adopt Dorothy  That Eloise feels that she must part with one of our children   Miss Ainslee smiled back bravely into the sick man s face. Dudley turned to one of the small windows. Across the street a man was watering his tiny lawn and the road in front of his house. A warm, moist, dusty smell filled the air. Children s voices rose in an ecstatic squeal of delight and ex- citement as the man evidently made a feint of turning the hose on them, too.  Oh, adopt is an ugly word,  Miss Ains- lee said, still trying to carry the scene off lightly,  and so is part, and they arc both so over-expressive. Dorothy is merely going away to school earlier than she would if she could continue to enjoy the advantages of Cranston s public schools. Eloise can have her during the vacations. I shall not be greedy. I shall be generous with Eloise.  Curtis threw out his hand with one of his sudden gestures.  There,  he said,  you feel that Doro- thy half belongs to you already; you speak as though you had the right to give or with- hold the child from her mother. And she would belong to you,  he wer.t on bitterly,  you would have her to watch over and help and advise during all those wonderful formative years of her youth that Eloise and 1 have planned for a hundred times. Eloise could spare either of the other chil- dren better than she could Dorothy.  Hostages to Fortune Miss Ainslee broke into a shaky little laugh.  It is too ridiculous ti  talk with the assumption that ymi arc to be uit off in your prime. I refuse to da it any longer.  Dudley moved away from 11 it- window' to the foot of the bed. He felt that he was now seeing in Curtis the reverse of the medal. Curtis s supreme unselfishness in preparing for death with no thought of himself was balanced bv he blind selfish- ness with which he considered onlv his    ife and his family. He seemed to have no idea of the sacrifices that Miss Ainslee would have to make to take the child. Dudley saw that in her brief talk with Eloise she had put aside her dream of studying abroad, and that she stood willing to give up, for Dorothv, her time, her money, her ideal: , lie looked at her slight figure and the deli- cate curve of her cheek as she stood with her head lowered and averted from Curtis; he could see the thin, fine corner of her mouth; her lips were trembling. Suddenly he felt an overmastering de- sire to help Margaret Ainslee, to shield her, to give her whatever she desired. It did not seem that he could bear t   have her sacrifice her slightest dream, her most un- important ideal. If she wanted a foreign de- gree, she should have it. He stood, for an instart,glaring before him w ith the intensity of histhought; then, his face lighted up, his rvos plowed as he turned them on Curtis.  Fred,  he said abruptly,  if this house could be sold for what you paid for it, could Eloise afford to bringup all threechiidren     Curtis rolled his head wearily on the pillow.  Oh, I suppose so; but it can t be sold for that.    Itcan, and ii shall be.  Curtis looked at him in astonishment.    want to buy it,  Dudley added,  and I won t be forced to pav a cent less than you paid.  Curtis smiled wanly. uEl lit, Warren,  he said, with a tender- ness not unmixed with bitterness.  Why don t you adopt one of the children, in- stead   It would be a more lasting charity to Eloise.  Dudley saw that in making his eager offer he had reckoned without his friend's pride: and he as eagerly began to try lo soothe the sick man. "Ilut you're all wrong, Fred. 1 wasn : thinking of you at all. I don't want t   l uv the house for your sake   it course,  lie added.   I'm glad if mv taking il would help you, I iiit, honestlv, I was thinking only  'f ' He stopped, and a deep llusli spread over his face as he realized how nearly he had come to dealing Miss Ainslee s pride an even harder blow than he had dealt his friend s. He had not looked toward her, but he was aware that she had turned around wher lie announced hi  desire to buy the house; and he felt that she was gazing at him in- tently. He now glanced quickly to warn her to see whether she had any suspii ion of what he had come so near revealing; but her face expressed onlv the exalted admira- tion with which women contemplate a Dor, Quixote when he is n  i too closely related to them. He wound up confusedly,  I want the house for myself. I want to live in it. ' Curtis, at his stammered explanation, turned from Dudley to Miss Ainslee, from his Hushed,embarrassed face to her soft, ap- proving eyes. This inspection seemed to atlord him a certain inspiration which mo- mentarily diverted him fr   m his own troubles and lighted his face with sudden pleasure  Dear Warren,  he exclaimed, attempt- ing to sit up and falling back again with ar. involuntary groan,  if  w  s what you want the house for. of course you mav have it Well, I am pleased. I congratulate you both. You're both good fellows, onlv I must say that vou've been i prettv pair of idiots to waitall these years. I toes Eloise know     He turned to AI iss Ainslee. She was star- ing at him as if  he believed he had become suddenly delirious. Then, comprehending what he thought had taken place between Dudle  and herself,  he began t.   blush and hated herself for Mushing. If she had looked at Dudley, she would have seen that he was blushing with even greater thorough- ness, but he wasn t aware of it; it is only a woman who can feel deeply and at the same time be conscious of the external manifes- tations of her emotion.   You're all wrong, I red,  he hastened to save Miss Ainslee the explanation,  there isn t anything to tell Floise. Nothing has happened. Nothing will happen. I got over that long ago; and, as for Margaret, she never had it to get over.  He realized dimly through his embarrass- 201 I Iostages to Fortune men  that, considering Mi   Ainslee s pres- ent c. his expression of his state of mind was neither tactful nor chivalrous, but he was thinking onlv of siting Curtis right. This lie had evidently brought about. Curtis had been set right, with the effect that every- thing again seemed wrong. " W ell, then,  he said,   I guess you won t have much use for this house. I wish you d call the nurse,  lu added, turning his face into the pillow.  But 1 do wan. the house, Fred,  Dud- ley was beginning again lame when Miss Ainslee interrupted him. She was not blushing now, but was rather pale and very ci  m   sed.  Frederick,  she said,  you did guess right, only 1 n ked Warren not lo a imoiinrc our engagement fora few months; and he has loyally carried his promise too far.  She could see, out of the corner of her eve, that Dudley was transfixed with as- tonishment. Curtis turned his face tow ard her, but he was too tired to feel as much pleasure in her positive statement as he had in his ou n mu misc.  Well, 1 am glad,  he said. Then he added,   I guess i  was going rather too far not to tell me now. You might not get another chance.  He smiled faintly at Dudley. "Yes,  Miss Ainslee rushed on.  and I want you to feel that, if anything should happen to you, ymir house will be bought by your nearest friend."  All right,  agreed Curtis somewhat wearily.    f course. I know it's friendly charily, in a wav; but I m too relieved and loo tired to be very proud. And the house is as good a one as vou'I I find for the m  'iiev. I ve  mi in a lot ot improvement- since it was built. Floise says that it is the most conveniently arranged house she ever s.iw ." At the mention of 'lis wife's na me he realize  1 that this convenient arrangement would probably become the housewifely fovo: an- other woman.   I guess you had better   all t ie nurse now." he said. lie held out his long, thin hand to Miss Ainslee and to Inidlev in turn. "You've made me feel a- comfortable as I I'dii feel,  he assured them; but he lei his hand fall so dead against the sheet after the warm pressure they gave it, and looked so pale and tired, that they were fearful and turned to the nurse, as she came into the room, to see what she thought of her patient. She went quickly to the bedside and pressed her fingers on Curtis s wrist. His eyes closed as if in answer to the firm, light touch. After an instant she looked toward Dudley and .Miss Ainslee, who had been w aiting in the doorway for some word from her. She motioned with her head for them to go out.  He'll sleep now,  she said, and they were forced to content themselves with this. W arren Dudley followed Margaret Ains- lee down the stairs in silence and out on the piazza, where she remained standing as if she expected him to take his leave; and lie said, rather awkwardly,  1 think I ll stay to hear what the doctors say,  and she answered,  Of course ; but made no motion to sit down. He wanted to thank her for helping him out of his dilemma, and he knew that she must be expecting him to do so: but he could not find words to do il simply and naturally as he could have done, earlier in the evening, before he had had anything to thank her for, anything, that is, except the great boon, for which he Imd expressed his gratitude, of turning him down in liis callow youth. Now, when, for the sake of poor Curtis's peace of mind, she had pre- tended to take him up again, the mere sound of the words in which she had en- lightened the sick man, the proud sincerity ot her attitude as she had spoken, and Curtis's pleasure and congratulations had made it, lor an instant, seem a reality; and, in that instant of pretence, he had learned the truth about himself. The last thing for w hich he would ever thank Margaret Ain-lee again  v0ul4l be for turning him down. Not that he contemplated going ihrough that ordeal once more, if, in the present tumult in his mind, he could be said to contemplate anything. He knew too well what she would suv, and he did not believe that the pain of hearing her say it would at all be balanced by the barren pleasure ot telling her that he loved her. lie gazed for a moment at the back of her head as she stood, a few feet from him, looking through the wire-netting into the street, where there was now nothing to see. The man across the way had stopped watering the road, and the children had g me into the house. Hostages to Fortune 205 At length he said,  I want to thank you for coming to my aid when I got into that corner with Fred.  She gave a short little laugh, and an- swered without turning round,  Oh, you needn t thank me. I didn t do it to help you out of a corner. I did it for poor, dis- tracted Frederick.    Oh, of course, of course. I know that; but it was so quick-witted and courageous and fine that I must thank you. Most women are so prudish that they would have let Fred die on the spot rather than say that they were going to marry me.   Well, you see, some one had to be quick- witted,  she said,  and I would have an- nounced my engagement to Satan himself to make Frederick feel more comfortable. It was theobviousand sensible thing to do,  she continued more seriously,  but a woman is thought unusual, I suppose, when shedoes the obvious and sensible. Now, if a man had announced his engagement to you, you wouldn t have thought of thanking him.   Indeed I should not,  Dudley said with emphasis, and they laughed together rather nervously. Then he added,  Anyway, you ll have to let Fred thank you if, by mak- ing him feel comfortable about the future of Eloise and the children, you have happened to save his life.  At this, Margaret Ainslee whirled swiftly around and faced him.  Oh,  she said fiercely,  how could you force me to say that I was engaged to you   Why did you leave it for me to say when you saw what Frederick thought  If he gets well, I shall never hear the last of it to my dying day. He will tease me unmerci- fully. And of course he will tell Eloise.  Suddenly she flung herself into a chair and covered her face with her hands. Poor Dudley, bewildered by this sudden transition,.shocked at the sight of her emo- tion, stood helplessly looking down at her. He was at a loss to know what to say to com- fort her, but he finally brought out,  But Eloise won t tease you. She ll be so grate- ful to you.   Oh, she'll pity me,  she spoke even more fiercely,  she'll think I did it for your sake because I cared for you. Oh, why didn't you do it yourself     If Dudley had been a married man for as many years as he had been a bachelor, he would have known that the strength and calmness with which some women go through an ordeal usually deserts them when there is no longer anything to go through with. If nerves have been screwed up, it naturally follows that they must un- coil with more or less resultant jangling; and a philosophic husband learns to stand by in silence until the vibrations cease. But Dudley was not a husband of any kind. He Was a lover who saw the object of his affections dissolved in tears at the mere pos- sibility of seeming to care for him. He saw, by this token, that he would have to give up whatever hope he might have cherished. By the sinking of his heart, Dudley knew that he had hoped, and that, for the second time, Margaret Ainslee would make him miserable. This fresh grip of an old pain made him feel sudden anger against the cause of it.  There is the cheering thought,  he said,  that Fred may die, and then he can t tease you. lie probably will not, in that case, have a chance to tell Eloise the glad tidings. But if he should pull through, and you should, in consequence, have to suffer the degradation of a supposed adoration of me, you can prove conclusively to Eloise that her suspicion is untrue, by telling her that I told you, here, to-night, that I loved you; that I asked you to marry me; and that you refused me.  He paused, but she made no sign that she had heard him.  If,  he went on,  after this proof, you still perceive a gleam of pity in her eye, you may tell her  and this will strike her nearer home  that I wasn t thinking at all of her husband when I offered to buy this house. I was thinking of you. I wanted to fix it so that you would not have to take Dorothy and lose your degree. Tell her that 1 was not trying to help my old friend to face death with a little more peace in his heart; but that I was trying to make it possible for a woman to gratify a barren ambition.  Miss Ainslee took her hands from her face and got quickly to her feet. Dudley could see that she held her head high, but he felt, rather than saw, in the dim light, that she was very angry.   I am sorry,  she began, her voice trem- bling with the tears she had just shed, and with her anger,  to be forced to tell you that your chivalrous sacrifice for my sake was entirely misplaced. I should much Hostages to Fortune rather have Dorothy than study abroad, to gratify my barren ambition. 1 fell glad, in spite of mv sympathy for Eloise, to think that I might have her child to bring up; and 1 felt sorry, in spite of my pilv for Frederick, when your noble otter took away mv chance of having the child. And 1 am even sorrier,  she continued, her irony los- ing much of its force because of her trem- bling tone,  to have to tell you that your other and greater otTer is equally futile. I am doubtless capable of many unwomanly things, such as a desire to advance and per- fect mvself in my chosen calling; but I am not capable, in order to save myself embar- rassment, of letting Eloise think that 1 have received and refused a proposal of marriage from you. Nevertheless, 1 thank you for your gracious permission. It was a brave thing, too. Did you stop to think that I might take your offer in earnest and accept before you had time to refuse for me   Foran instant, Dudley, filled with hisown turbulent emotion,did not comprehend how she had misinterpreted his feeling; but when he realized that she had taken hisangrvpain for contempt, his anger was swept away on a wave of contrition and love.   Margaret,  he cried,   1 am in earnest. 1 was never more in earnest in my life, not even twelve years ago, out there in Ohio. I thought then, when 1 went east, that I cared more for you than any one ever did before for anybody; but I know now that T care more than I did then. I didn t mean to tell you this. 1 knew that it wouldn t do me any good if I should, and it would only pain you. Hut I must have had a faint hope; for when you showed how you hated the thought that Eloise might imagine vou cared for me, 1 knew, by the utter desolation which seized me, that I  ; ;   hoped; and in my misery, I laid to speak, 1  uu  to pain you. I know that: I was a coward to do it. My hopelessness and wretchedness is my only excuse. Now, do you believe that I love you   She had turned from him as he spoke, and stood with her head averted. She did not answer him for a moment. Then she said, with an evident effort,   Yes, I believe you. 1 am sorry 1 spoke to you so. Please forgive me.   Oh, I forgive you that,  he said rather bitterly.   1 love you so much that 1 can even forgive you for not loving me.  She remained silent, and he went on,  Having said everything that I had no business to say, I'll go home. You were tired, and 1 have succeeded in tiring you more. So long as Fred is ill, I shall have to be here every day; but 1 promise not to speak to you again of the way I feel. Good-night.   You had better stay until the surgeon comes,  she said.   You might be needed.   Yes, I'll stay, of course. I had for- gotten poor Fred for the moment.  She sank into the chair he placed for her. Neither spoke, and it was with evident relief that Dudley exclaimed,  There they are,  as an automobile rushed through the deserted street, and stopped, panting, be- fore the house. In the light from the hall, the surgeon, who had slowly followed Dr. Hinton s nim- ble figure up the steep steps, was revealed as a tall man, fat to the point of grossness. Dr. Hinton said to Miss Ainslee,  We may go right up   Without waiting for her answer, he led the way into the house. The surgeon did not seem to l ie aware that there was any one on the piazza, nor even that his colleague had spoken. Fie gazed straight ahead through the open door at the flight of stairs going up at one side of the hall. He gave a sigh, that was almost a groan, as he began the ascent. Ilis 1 arge, white hand with its puffy fingers slid slowly up the banister.  Well,  said Dudley, as the two phy- sicians disappeared on the floor above,  I guess they ll have to revive Dr. Mc- Naughton before he can look Fred over. He s the figure of a butcher rather than a surgeon. It does not seem as if so fat a man could be as deft as he is said lo be.   Yes, lie s very fat,  Miss Ainslee an- swered absently. Dudley had promised that he would not speak to her any more of his feeling for her. This promise, after they had reseated themselves resulted in his not speaking to her at all. If he couldn t speak of the way he felt when, in her presence, he seemed to l e all feeling, he would have to remain silent, lie was not capable of making conversation when his brain was in such a state. Miss Ainslee, for her part, said nothing. She sat with her head bent, her hands lightly folded in her lap. Presently, however, she spoke. Hostages to Fortune 207  Weren t you in earnest, then,  she asked, as if the train of thought which she had been following had brought her to the question,  when you thanked me for not marrying you years ago  Vou seemed in earnest. You seemed to have a terror nf the responsi- bilities of a married man. And yet -  And yet,  Dudley caught her up,  I asked you to marry me. I was in earnest. If I were in a state of mind, now, lo con- sider marriage philosophically, 1 should say the same things, I should have the same terror. But when a man is in love, he can t look upon marriage as an institution. All it means to him. then, is having the woman he loves fnr his wife. The only terror in the world, then, is her refusal to marrv him.  "It seems lo me that you ceased very suddenly to be a philosopher." " You mean that I seem to have become a lover only within the last hour or so  1 don t think that I ve been out of love with you for twelve years past. I ve only made myself believe that 1 was; and, to-night, 1 realized that 1 had never got over caring for you, and never would. But why do you make me say these things to you   It affords me more pain than pleasure, I assure you. It can afford you neither.    I want to be sure,  she said slowly.   I want to feel sure that you will not become the philosopher again by to-morrow.   And I wish to Heaven that I might. What good can it do you to be sure that I shall be actively unhappy all my days  You are not a vain woman.  She continued to gaze at her hands, folded in her lap.  No, I m not vain.  Something in hertonemade Warren Dud- ley s heart beat faster with sudden hope.  Tellme,Margaret,did vou mean it when you said that you would rather have Dorothy totakecareof than getvourdegreeabroad      Yes, I meant it. I think that Eloise, ill, facing her husband s possible death and her consequent comparative poverty, with three children to bring up, is a happier woman than I have ever been.  He forced himself to continue his cate- chism calmly.  But, according lo your theory, Eloise has lost her individuality, her freedom; has buried her talents; isas primitive as a cave- dweller. Have you changed your mind about her    No, I haven't changed mv mind about her; but she s happy.  Miss Ainslee lifted her head, and looked at her companion, l lie rest doesn't seem lo count.  I Hidley   a me i lose to her ch;i ir. I le I ried to read her face in the dim light.  V  ul l you I  e happy in l ib lise s plat e  "  No,  ilie smiled faintly,  but I think that 1 should be happv in mv own place." "l o you mean   he began. He lin- ished his question by taking her in bis arms; and she answered him i iv slaving there with no prole I other than a murmured, " ih, we ought not to lie happv when Fred and Eloise are in such trouble.  "I don't believe,  he said,  that love ever waits until all things are meet and lit. If il did, no man would ever propose, no woman ever marrv. Eove seizes upon its fullilmenl as the onl  right thing in the world. The meet and the lit must follow, il they can. If Eloise and Fred had wailed for perfectly clear sailing, they wouldn t be married yet." She drew away from him.  Oh, we must not marry. T could not bear to have you ever suffer the agony of mind that Frederick has had to endure. You said that vou would die of remorse and terror if you were anv one of ninetv- nine out of every hundred married men you know.   And now,  he answered, drawing a chair beside hers, and taking her hand in his,  I ll die if I'm not one of the ninety- nine. But I intend to be the hundredth mail. Of course, I take my chances with the others. 1 realize that 1 might, some day, lose my health, my position, my money, my life; and leave you destitute.

If he didn t have to, things wouldn t balance; there would be too much unalloyed happi- ness in the world; or, perhaps,  he added thoughtfully,   there wouldn t be so much.  They sat in silence for some moments, then he said,  How are you going to rec- oncile vourself to the loss of your inde- pendence and individuality and all that    Oh, mv independence and individual- ity   she exclaimed disdainfully.   1 don t believe that there is such a thing in the world as independence. If a man does absolutely as he pleases, then he's a slave 2 1 X Hostages to Fortune to himself; and if lie does as some one else pleases, then lie's ;i slave to the other per- son; but, somehow, if lie loves the other person, that slaverv sets him free. That sounds esoteric, doesn t it, but it s just plain, evervdus human nature. As to my individu- ality, the only trouble is that I shall always remain the same person, in any circum- stances. I don t cherish my individuality as I used to, for I realize, now, that I can never lose it; and I d rather like to, some- times.   Thank Heaven,you can t lose :t," Dud- ley said.   Hut, Margaret, arc vou sure that it is not this weariness of your life and your- self which makesyou willing to marry me  Are you sure you care for me "   You dear, old goose " she answered,  can t you tell "  This evidently struck Dudley as cor.clu- sive proof, for he said nothing more until he asked that inevitable and thrilling question which, since the world began, has agitated the bosoms of lovers with sweet tumult. "When did you begin to care for me   he said.   I don't know when I began to care, but I know when I realized that 1 did. It was when you assured Frederick that you had got over caring for me.  A few minutes later. Dr. Hinton s light step and Dr. McNaughton s heavy one sounded on the s.airs. Miss Ainslee rose quickly, and went into the hall, and Dudley followed. Dr. Hinton smiled as he saw her. ' You see 1 was right, Miss Ainslee. This consul la i ion. at least, did not mean a n oper- ation. I r. McNaughton thinks that Mr. Curtis will pull through without his help. The nurse tells me that he seemed to have something on his mind which he wished lo talk over with Mr. Dudley, so she let him have his say. It seems to have done him go   d.     The surgeon paused on the lowest step, and bowed to Miss Ainslee. 11 is eyes looked very small in his large face, but verv keen.   The patient s temperature,  he ex- plained.   is a quarter of a degree lower than it was when Dr. Hinton saw him earlier in the evening. We infer from this that the inflammation of the appendix is being re- duced. Owing to the condition of the pa- tient's heart, we shall not operate although, in most cases, it is the safest thing to do.  "You mean,  cried Miss Ainslee,  that he may have another attack    He may, and he may not. He must take his chances. At least, he will recover this time. And, anyway, my dear young lady,  added Dr. McNaughton, with a sort of philosophic gallantry, lowering himself with the aid of the newel-post from the lowest step to the hall floor,  are not all of us taking chances all the time   Mias Ainslee turned to Dr. Hinton.   Did you see Airs. Curtis  Did you tell her that an operation was not necessary    Yes, I told her. I left her weeping as though her heart would break. I wish vou women could only learn to bear up under happiness the way you do under unhappi- ness.  He crossed the piazza, and Hung open the screen door.  Come, Doctor, we ll make record time to the ferry through these empty streets.    You see   ;.m taking one of my chances now,  Dr. McNaughton called back, as the automobile started at a bound flown the quiet road.  Thank Heaven,  said Dudley huskily, when the physicians were out of sight,  that poor, old I'red lias some more chances to tak.j.    If he had died,  said Miss Ainslee,  I could never have forgiven myself for hav- ing been happy to-night. It was horribly sellish.  " Do you think, then, that it was selfish of Fred to continue being     happy when he believed that we were engaged and, therefore, presumably happy    Hut he was thinking about Eloise and the children.  "And ice were thinking of each other. I suppose,  he added,  that love is almost as selfish as it is unselfish. It s a sort of intensive cultivation. I can manage to love only one other human creature better than I love irvself. Do you despise me for such exclusiveness     I am very much afraid,  she answered, holding out iier hands to him,   that I love you foi it.  GREAT ACTING AND THE MODERN DRAMA Walter Prichard Eaton 81 IHE greatest influence on opera during the nineteenth century was exerted by Richard Wagner; the great- est influence on drama by Henrik Ibsen. Both men worked, in a sense, for the same end, the one for musical tnith, for the perfect cor- respondence of score and text, the other for dramatic truth, for the perfect correspond- ence of incident and character. Opera since Wagner has continued to demand of its interpreters the fi .est musical talent, and a degree of dramatic skill undreamed of in the days of Handel, Mozart, or even the early Verdi. But the drama since Ibsen, on the contrary, seems to demand ever less of its interpreters, until at the present time great acting, even moving acting, is rare on our stage, and on all sides we hear the shrill complaint,   There are no great actors any more.  What is the reason for this   Perhaps there is no single reason suffi- cient completely to explain the fact. But there is one reason that stands up above the others, and that, in a measure, may be said to include some of the others. It is a simple reason, too. Great actors can only be made by training in great parts; great acting can only be felt and yielded to when its spell is put forth in great roles. There are, practically, no great parts in modem drama. We have no great actors apparent in the new generation of players because we have no training school for them; we see no great acting because we see no great parts performed. Milton could not have been Miltonic on a lesser theme than the fall of the Angels    The condition of opera was improved by Wagner because the base of opera is music, and that base remains through every change of emphasis or style, in text or interpretation. It is no less the base of Strauss s   Salome    in spite of certain critics   than of Mozart s  Magic Flute.  Every step toward a closer correspond- ence of score and text, toward the elim- ination of  costume concerts  and the substitution of significant acting, was yet taken on this base of music. Ultimately, as much to-day as one hundred and fifty years ago, the appeal of opera is a musi- cal appeal; it is to the sensuous ear, how- ever much it may now be re-enforced by an appeal to the intelligence. Once opera required singers to interpret it; now it re- quires singing actors. But the song ele- ment remains the basic one. In the drama, however, the sure base of a sensuous charm, or essentially poetic ap- peal, does not inevitably exist. In certain kinds of drama it is found to a large degree; in certain other kinds it is not found at all. One of the latter kinds is, as a rule, the modem prose drama of contemporary life. Ibsen and the modem dramatists have worked to make incident and character correspond, to eliminate artificiality of plot, and the  situations  which are devised ar- bitrarily because the actor must have his chance to shine, not because the character the actor is playing would naturally bring such situations about, or is significantly affected by them. These  situations  cor- responded to the arias and coloratura pas- sages of the older operas. One of Modjes- ka s great performances was of Adrienne Lecouvreur, a part that was set in a drama as preposterous as any of the older operas, and, unless greatly played, as incapable of giving pleasure as is the mad scene in  Lucia  when not greatly sung. In the stem elimination of any but truthful,logical and significant situations, in the stem sup- pression of   emotional scenes     for thei r own sake, when such scenes do not arise natu- rally from the character and explain the in- tellectual message of the play, Ibsen and the modem dramatists have forged a technique which is capable of setting forth contem- porary life on the stage as truthfully and plausibly as in a novel, of teaching by infer- ence an ethical or political or even philo- sophic lesson, of making the drama seem in the eyes of thinking men and women a more serious and important thing than it has been, in English, at least, for more than a century. 209 210 Great Acting and the Modern Drama And in doing this, the dramatists have done well. But they have inevitably dune it at a tremendous sacrifice. The size of this sacrifice is measured by the difference between Charlotte Cushman and Maude Adams, between Kdwin Booth and Will- iam Faversham. They have done it at the sacrifice of great acting. And that is because the modem prose drama of contemporary life, in throwing over the old absurdities of plot and incident, the old pack of situations devised to put the player into a state of emotional frenzy, by placing the emphasis on the intellectual drift of the drama and its truth as a picture or lesson, has thrown over poetry as well, and great characters. Many of the old dramas had no real poetry, and many of their  great  characters were not great at all, but merely went through the motions of greatness.   Virginius  is not great, and certainly is not poetry, though vanished gi- ants of the stage, such as Macready and Forrest, achieved, we are told, astonishing emotional results in M. Richelieu is not a great character, blit one so placed in a tricky melodrama that a great player can make him seem so. Mr. Sothern in this part does not satisfy the older critics, who once saw Booth s magnificent Cardinal. But Mr. Sothern   very' failings show the real weakness of the character. But there were poetic dramas in the past, and there were great characters set upon the stage  nd engaged in doing great deeds, even outside the works of Shakespeare. It is because the modern dramatists have found no poetry and no greatness in modern life that they have lost such a :irm base as that upon which opera still rests; and, as a conse- quence, great acting seems to have perished lor want of a soil to grow in. Ibsen himself created two poetic plays, o mtaining two characters of such range r.nd depth as to deserve the adjective great  " Brand " and   Peer Gynt.  But as he de- veloped, as his plays became closer pictures and more direct commentaries on his day and generation, his characters shrank, at times almost into meanness. 11 requires, of course, :i sure technique and verv genuine talent to play  Tkdda Gabler.  But no genius was ever so llaming as to make that character great nor would it then be Hedda Gabler  It requires a touch of eerie poetry to play " The Lady from the Sea   but no genius was ever so flaming as to re- move from her the taint of nerves, the mod- ern blight. The most effective of Pinero s characters is probably Paula Tanqucray. She has been played in all European lan- guages, by the finest actresses of recent years. But, played by the best of them, Paula remains a study; pitied, perhaps, at times; observed with interest always; butal- ways essentially small, mean, a trifle cheap. Mr. Jones has never created a great charac- ter. In his most poignant moments, as in the third act of  The Hypocrites,  he gets his largeness of effect by carefully wrought suspense a perfectly legitimate dramatic effect, but one that does not require su- preme, or even great, acting to illumine. Mr. Barrie is the wisest, the most nearly poetic, the most charming of present authors writing for the English-speakingstage. And yet Mr. Barrie has never created a great character. Occasionally he has come peril- ously near it;   Peter Pan   trails a shadow of the things tlu.t never die. Mr. Barrie, it will be noted, least literally renders life about him, works most from the inner vi- sion. That is why he is most nearly' a poet, lays hold on the things that are most last- ing, comes closest to resting his work on a firm basis of enduring charm. But, though whimsical and sound, he is surely not am- ple. He misses the sheer size we demand of greatness. Of recent successful plays in America, the one which has been most popular of all, which has given the widest scope for acting of a purely virtuoso sort, and for emotional response from an audience, is  The Music Master.  And that play is, curiously, the least modern in content, the most old-fash- ioned and far-away from the new spirit in drama. It is a   one part  play; it is a se- ries of arias and emotional coloratura pas- sages for David Warfield. Yet it has swept the entire country, by virtue of just that fact - Because it does give an opportunity for ample acting, which is amply met by the player. It has shown that we do not want act- ing to be a lost art. The   Witching Hour,  however, has no great part, hence no oppor- tunity for ample acting; it succeed: by its intellectual message.  The Lion and the Mouse  had no great part; it succeeded because of its political drift.  The Great Divide  and the same author s new play,  The l'aith Healer,  tremble on the verge Great Acting and the Modern Drama 211 of poetry if not greatness. To suggest convincingly the soul struggle of the former play surely requires a capacity for poetry in the players, and must react to their devel- opment. To suggest the inner fire and force of  The Faith Healer  will surely require a touch of greatness of the actor essaying the role. The character is no mere Kentucky gambler of  The Witching Hour : he is a Savonarola of the Plains. But Mr. Moody, the author of these plays, has previously been known as a poet, and though now working in prose, obviously he is working more from an inner vision than a photographer s sense. Farce and frivolity the stage has always had, and always will. We need not con- sider that now. Some of our vanished gi- ants appeared in rubbish. William Warren played parts in his day which George M. Cohan would have blushed to devise, and Garrick was not always great. But a care- ful consideration of the seriously inclined plays of the present generation in America, or elsewhere, cannot fail to show that what we have gained over the past in truthful reflection on the stage of actual life about us we have lost in the majesty of the char- acters depicted, in the depth and inten- sity of the emotions portrayed. And conse- quently our players have lost the force and sweep and power the older actors were obliged to develop to play the older parts. Charlotte Cushman s  Lady Macbeth  had an emotional appeal and an ample sweep of imagination incomparably greater than Maude Adams s  Lady Babbie,  be- cause it was a successful embodiment of a vastly greater role. But it would not have been successful had Miss Cushman been trained in no wider nor deeper range of parts than Miss Adams has. Salvini s performance in  La Morte Civile  was tremendous in its overpowering emotional effect. The audiences used to gasp and sob. But if he, like David Warfield, had played in only four dramas in his entire ca- reer, or, like scores of promising actors of to-day, had never had a chance to play a big part in his life, a part with the weight of poetry behind it and varied and ample emotional expression, Salvini would never have tom the breasts of his audiences as he did. Indeed, it will be noted that E. H. Sothem did not attempt  Dundreary  till he had played  Hamlet.  Even for sus- tained comcdy a severe training is required. And it will be noted that most of the play- ers on our stage to-day who possess power and amplitude Miss Marlowe, Mrs. Fiske, Otis Skinner, for example have had long schooling in large parts, beginning in   the old school.  But all this does not mean that progress consists in going backward. It does not mean that the way for a modem actor to demonstrate his greatness is to play   Vir- ginius,  or for an actress is to play  Adri- enne.  It does not mean that the way for a modem playwright to create great oppor- tunities for the players is to devise elabo- rate emotional arias for them, nor that the way for him to be poetic is necessarily to twist good honest prose back end foremost into blank verse. That would mean to lose all that the drama has toilfully gained; that would be reversion, not progress. Some of the modem emphasis in stage entertainment on the intellectual message of the play, rather than the emotional ef- fects of the actors, is doubtless ephemeral, a passing fashion. The success of  The Music Master   shows that. But much of it is real and lasting, and a great gain. Were the choice between   King Lear   and, let us say,  The Witching Hour,  who would hesitate to choose   But it isn t. Shake- speare does not   abide our question.  He is for all time, for all ages, all fashions, like Sophocles and Moliere. Rather is the choice between   Virginius,  or   The Iron Chest,  or   Adrienne Lecouvreur,  or  Caste,  and   The Witching Hour.  And shall we hesi- tate   We must keep fast hold on our truth - ful drama of contemporary life, with its in- tellectual drift, its  criticism of life,  its message to the head as well as the emotions. Nobody will care a hundred years hence what we thought about old Rome or lands of mythical romance. But what we thought about the problems of the hour will be history. Progress will come, the restoration of great acting and of poetry will come, when our modem dramatists discover greatness and poetry in contemporary life, when the representation of great emotions is de- manded of the actors not as a   stunt   in an unimportant or false story, but as a logical outcome of an important and truthful story, as the natural expression of great men and women. Nobody cares much to-day and 212 Of Transient Beauty who can be blamed   about the emotions of old Virginius and his impossible off- spring; nor can anybody raise a tear for Adrienne Lecouvreur in her pasteboard world. But some of us could care very much about the emotions of a great American in the face of a great modern crisis. Wc hear of tremendous, fabulous fortunes, for ex- ample, and we fancy the men who amassed these fortunes must be men of power, of a certain kind of greatness, if not the finest kind, if not of moral greatness. Yet we see one of them depicted in   The Lion and the Mouse,  with nothing great about him. The author has failed to grasp liis opportunity. There was a touch of sinister greatness, pos- sibly, about the copper king, Samson, in M. Bernstein s play, but in America we saw the character entrusted to an actor who had never in his life played a part that fitted him for the representation of greatness, and the effect was, for us, quite lost. Kipling sighed for a man  like Bobbie Burns, to sing the song o  steam.  We may well sigh for a dramatist to write the play of steam, or of electricity, or Wall Street, or Socialism, or Labor Unions, or the in- creased cost of living. Swinburne died recently, and we mourned the last of the poets. Irving and Coquelin died, and we mourned the passing of the actors. But somehow the rest of us go ahead thinking the same old thoughts, and feeling the same old thrilling pangs, and doing, now and then, the same old brave, foolish, ideal deeds. We are still the raw material of drama. And there is no tariff. In their preoccupation with modem peo- ple and modem problems, then, a preoccu; pation inevitably conditioned by thechangq in dramatic standards, if they would once again fertilize the soil for great acting and acting touched with the glow of poetry, the dramatists must find great modem people to depict, set them great problems to wrestle with, and endow their Kves with an inner gleam of charm and beauty. It is not enough for our actors to return to  the classicreper- toire.  A good deal of that repertoire the new generation does not want. And, to in- sist that our actors return toit for their train- ing, is surely to crush out present and future playwrights, to block the wheels of progress. Great acting in the future must be developed by the plays of the future. And already there are hints that such acting may be so devel- oped . There is something epic about   Mag- da.  There was nothing small about Mrs. Fiske s   Tess.  Mr. Moody has stirred the breath of poetry on our stage, and out of the ample places brought an ample man. What our stage needs is playwrights of greater and nobler imagination. What our actors need is a chance.

The citv. bv a vote of fourteen tn one. prompilv issuetl bond. toihe requisite amount and llie stupendous project is now being carried out. The sum invested is large, but there will be water enough lo ir- rigate all of I .os Angeles County, and the sale of  hi- and of the electric power ob- tainable will more than pay the interest. San Francisco also needs more water, and also seeks to i et it in the Sierra  evader bul whereas the Owens River project and Portland's I loorl River supplv are unmixed 1 he- Progressive I ueilu Coast 223 blessings, San Francisc i s plan In annex the Iletch-Hetchy Valley is an unjustifiable al tempi to help a city to water at the cosl   f the w hole nation.

William Keith, suqiasses even the Yosemile   alley in picturesque beauty and   harm, li is, in fact, in many respects, a duplicate of that vallev, having counterparts of the Bridal Veil, Yosemile, and Vernal Falls, nf the Merced River, of l l Capitan and other cliffs rising precipitously to over half a mile- above the floor of the   alley, which is one of Nature's masterworks in flower, park, and landscape gardening. This sublime valley the San Franciscans are endeavoring to ruin by building a dam which would submerge the floor one hun- dred and seventy-five feet, changing it to a lake  Against this project John Muir, who has. with patriotic foresight, worked so hard in behalf of our national parks, exclaims in righteous indignation: "Dam Hetch-Hetchv  As well dam for water tanks the pe  ple's cathedrals and c hurdles. lor no holier temple has ever been conse- i rated by the heart o  man." 'I he project, il carried mil, would not onlv ruin Iletch- 11  t  hy. but a part ot the  irand   anv in of the Tuolumne. "The sublime   an von way to ihe heart of the High Sierra would be hopelessly blocked." In fact, if San Fran- i isco gut its drinking water here, the w hole vallev of the I uolumne would have to be i losed to visitors and campers for sanitary reasons; and this would mean the exilu- si ni fn 'in ' me-half     the     isemile Nati 'tial I ark "  the people of the United Slates, ft r whom it w as   reated ' 11 w  mid I ie hard I" make  Ui h a sacrifice if it w -re actually imperative, which it is very far from being. Col.  V. II. Heuc-r, I". S. V. engineer and chairman of the F.x- ecutive Committee of the Federated Water Committee, states that the city's present sources "can be increased bv additional   la ms and raising some existing dams, so as to supply considerably more than one hun- dred million gallons per day, or more than enough to supplv the wants of San Fran- cisco during the next forty years, and at Spring Street.

Some of these are in the same mountains as the Hetch-Hetchy, and their pure water could be brought down at much less cost. These indisputable facts show that there is absolutely no justification for the pro- posed grub. Congress will be called upon to decide whether the Yosemite National Park is to belong to the Nation or to one of its cities which happens to covet it. San Franciscans cannot afford to alienate the sympathies of all nature-lovers in the whole country by persisting in their unreasonable demand that the country make them a pres- ent of its grandest park. Enough, surely, was clone by the Nation for this city when it donated more than ten million dollars after the earthquake and fire. At present the Hetch-Hetchy is almost as difficult of access as the Yosemite was a few years ago, when the return trip included three whole days of staging. But it will soon be made accessible, for it is already badly needed, to receive the Yosemite over- 224 flow. The completion of the railway to El Portal, the gate of the Park, leaving only twelve miles of staging to the Valley, has enormously increased its popularity as a summer resort. Last June we found, be- side the hotel, three camps, each with tent accommodations for about two hundred persons, and each crowded to its capacity. Day and night trains  with sleepers for Los Angeles and San Francisco  are run by both the Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific, whose superbly illustrated folders bear wit- ness to the fact that Californians are su- preme in theart of advertising their vaunted scenery in the most alluring style. It is because of this very characteristic that one wonders there can be the least op- position to the strenuous efforts of John Muir and his helpers to keep this world- famed scenic marvel intact. Mr. Muir has written books on the mountains of Califor- nia. and on our national parks; he has spent most of his life in them; he knows better than any one else what irreparable loss the proposed vandalism would mean.

Recent progress in various utilitarian and aesthetic ways owes much to him, and will owe much more to him in the future.

San Francisco, after the earthquake and fire of April, 1906, had a grand opportunity to follow the example of Burbank and Muir in combining beauty with utility. Some   l the streets, at any rate, might have been built on easy contour lines instead of the monotonous parallels so ill-suited to this hilly site; but all attempts at this, or al w id- ening some of the narrow business streets, or bonding the city for new parks and play- grounds, failed. Selfish interests prevented any concerted action, and the chance is lost. Yet il would beunjust to infer from this that loaquin Miller was right when he wrote, long before I liis calamity, that   the heart of California, San Francisco, is comparatively without heart, loyally, or love of home." Surelv history records no more remarkable disphu of loyally and love of home lhan iliaL which impelled llie victims ot this catastro- phe to begin rebuilding before the ashes were cold, and to rebuild at such a record- breaking rate that the prediction made by both David Starr Jordan anti Benjamin Ide Wheeler, that in five years San Francisco would be herself again, seems likely to come true. We found piles of calcined bricks, fire-twisted massesof iron, ashes, a nil weeds, and ruins still in many places where splendid 227 The Progressive Pacific Coast buildings had stood; but the business streets were being restored rapidly by the erection of rows of Structures finer and more sub- stantial than those that had been destroyed. Naturally, the first buildings to go up were houses of commerce, and as regards these the charge cannot be made that beauty is I cing ignored. The public buildings will come later, and the thousands of families that moved to temporary homes in Oak- and most precious of inspirations the in- spiration of things to do and things undone, the inspiration of big jobs.   I believe, also, that the civic loyalty and activity thusstimu- lated have awakened the inhabitants from their dangerous indifference to the startling gains of the rival coast cities, particularly Los Angeles and Seattle. The San Francis- cans are on the run again, and are likely not only to recover lost ground but to light hard Mount Hood from the north, elevation 7,000 feet. land, Berkeley, and other cities that may some day be included in the Greater San Francisco, are returning gradually. Progress in San Francisco must for a few years longer mean getting back to the point where it was before the lire. Not entirely, however; in the long run that disaster may prove to have been a blessing in disguise. The city has got rid of many old buildings that were a menace and an eyesore; and the lesson has been learned that it is not the shanties but the tall modem buildings that best withstand earth tremors. Huge tanks are being erected in various quarters, with an arrangement of pipes which, in case of another earthquake, will not leave the city at the mercy of flames. The task of re- building a metropolis has given San Fran- ciscans what Professor Joyce calls   the best to keep what they had, especially the lion's share of the Oriental trade. In the attitude toward the Orientals themselves it seemed to me that there was an improvement, not only here but all along the coast. In Portland they tell you with- out resentment that there are thirty Chinese voters, Amcrican-bom. In Seattle, during the Exposition, when all the resident Chi- nese paraded the streets with their one hun- dred and fifty foot dragon, I heard not a jeering word from the thousands of onlook- ers. It is one of the characteristics of the Pacific Coast that men are judged solely by what they are individually; the labor- ing class is the one which chiefly benefits by this attitude, yet it has retaliated by showing the most unreasoning prejudice against workers from the Orient, condemn- Several streams at work excavating one of the highest portions uf Denny Hell, Seattle, The l ni resM vc I acilir L cinst l'  -i tlic si.nl11 seers.

There was great excite- ment last summer when it was learned that J. J. Hill had taken steps to build the rail- way  projected by Henry Yillard thirty years ago   from The Dalles on the Colum- bia River down through central Oregon. Greater still was the excitement when it be- came likely that the Harriman company would resent this invasion of its Oregonian monopoly by also building an    regotv Cen- tral line. There is room for both; they will soon have all the freight they can handle; for the resources of this part of the State  of the whole State in fact have only begun to be tapped. With an area of 96,699 square miles, Oregon has to-day a popula- tion of under Ooo.ooo, while ten times that number might find happy homes here. The boundary line is well chosen. As you tation delights the eye in even- direction, and the ferns and vines and shrubs and trees retain their green throughout the drv- est months. If California is a paradise in winter, so is   Jregon in summer. The con- trast is great and pervasive. Equally great is the contrast between the inhabitants. California was peopled bygold hunters,   Jre- gon by home seekers. These home seekers found what they wanted and, like the lovers in the last chapterof an old-style novel, lived happily forever afterward, oblivious of the rest of the world. A ycung man told me last summer that one day, while the Lewis and Clark Exposition wasin progress at Port- land, he took a drivein thecountry and came across a farmer who had a wagon-load of superb pears.

There was an i ni re a so of j_  per eent. in the post- oliii e receipts Iasi September over those of the same month in the preceding year. The Progressive Pacific Coast 233 In 1905, the year of the Lewis and Clark Exposition, the bank clearings for the third week of August were $3,314,004. For the same week last year they were $7,017,424, a gain of more than 110 per cent, in four years. In the building activity of last Au- gust there was a gain of 28 per cent, over that of the preceding August. The present population probably exceeds 200,000. In the scattered suburbs there is much that  as we heard a woman say in the cars at Kla- math Falls   looks awful preliminary, as Jim says ; but the city itseLf has preserved that settled, refined, dignified aspect which has always distinguished it. It has grown more beautiful too. Since it began to have its annual flower festival it has become known as the   Rose City.  One might properly call Oregon the Rose State, not only because cultivated roses grow so rank- ly and all the year round, but because wild- rose bushes attain dimensions unknown elsewhere. They are among rose bushes what the California sequoias are among the world s big trees. The climate does it a great climate  I was in Oregon seventy-one days last summer, and if I could have regu- lated the thermometer to suit myself, I should not have touched it three times  A night s sleep in Oregon is worth a week s vacation in the East. Commercially, the biggest things in Ore- gon, the things which built up its wealth, are salmon, fruit, and lumber. Formerly it was wheat, in place of fruit, but wheat growing shows a decrease, as it does in Cali- fornia, and for the same reason: the wheat land, given up to fruit or hops, will yield twenty times as much money. In salmon there has been a retrogression of late, but simply because the foolish Columbia River fishermen killed the fish which laid the gold- en eggs. As soon as the law is enforced, the salmon will again be as plentiful in the Columbia as they were last summer iri the neighboring State of Washington, where all records were broken, thousands of tons es- caping the cans because the fishermen, working twenty-four hours a day, could not trap or net them. In a good year like that, the salmon catch is worth seven million dol- lars to Washington. What their trees are worth to these two States is almost incredible; the figures give one a dizzy feeling. To Oregon alone its timber interests are worth sixty million dol- Vol. XLVII. 26 lars a year. There are now standing in this State three hundred billion feet of merchantable timber which, at the present rate of cutting, would last one hundred and twenty years. According to the State Board of Forestry, the commercial value of Ore- gon s standing timber is three billion six hundred million dollars, a sum in excess of the total amount of money in currency in the United States at present. Great prog- ress has been made in recent years in elimi- nating wasteful methods of lumbering and in fighting forest fires; in 1908 there were one hundred and eighty fire wardens in the State, and there was a noticeable decrease in the number of great fires. The inhabitants of the Emerald State are at last beginning to realize the value of their trees. This implies a great changc an as- pect of Oregon psychology on which it would be interesting to dwell. To the early settlers in this State trees were hated ob- stacles. These pioneers needed clearings to plant their vegetables and wheat, and the trees had to be exterminated laboriously. Some of the older men still harbor the ha- tred of the firs thus acquired; they cut them down on trivial pretexts:  they might fall on the house during a storm,   they shade the fruit-trees.  Even shrubs are included in the carnage, because of this inherited passion for   clearings.  A Portland lady who owns a cottage on the coast told me that one day, when she returned to it, she was horrified to find that a neighboring farmer, who felt under obligations to her, had cleared away all the brush surrounding it, mostly wild-rose bushes.  They were real pretty, too   he said to her by way of emphasizing the nobility of his deed  Altogether too much liberty is allowed farmers in burning up their  slashings  during the summer months; not only be- cause these home-made fires often spread to the forests, but because they create a dense smoke which for weeks completely obliterates the glorious mountain scenery. Mount Hood is to Oregon, and especially to Portland, what Fuji is to Japan. It unites beauty with grandeur as perhaps no other mountain does except the Swiss Jungfrau; yet, together with the other snow peaks Visible from Portland Heights, it cannot be seen for weeks at a time in summer, except by going up to Government Camp on the south side, or to Cloud Cap Inn on the north The Progressive Pacific Coast - ii lo. 1 loro' me i- ball wav up the mi  un tain, ami it- snmvv   one i-  above the snmkc.

Recall what Inr  dimate and scenery have done for Cali- fornia; and think of the some sixtv million dollars whic It Switzerland derives every vear from Iter scenery and her summer climate  The most notable instance of recent prog- ress from t his point of view is the construc- tion of the government road up to I aradi-e Valley, some live thousand five hundred feet up the south side of Mount Tacoma, whence one gets unspeakably grand views ol its snowy slopes and summit. The fa- mous road expert, Mr. Samuel Hill, whom we were -o lorluuateas to meet here, show- ing l ari Grey that  ve have something to beat even his Canadian Rockies, has glori- ous plans for a road encircling the w hole mountain, showing it from every point of view It will be the grandest road in Ameri- ca, for Tacoma is our grandest mountain.   Jbviouslv, the grandest mountain in all America should  e all American. Let us call it Mount Tacoma, not Mount Rainier. Tacoma is its original American name. Most of the Indian tribes living within sight of it, among them the I uyallups.Nesquallis, Yakimas, and Klickilats, called it  Ti.kho- ma," " the mountain." When Captain Van- couver  discovered  this peak, in 1792, he referred in his diary to "the round snowy mountain . . . w iieh, after my friend Rear- Admiral Rainier, 1 distinguish by the name of Mount Rainier." He did not know its Indian name and probably would have ig- nored il if he h;  1 known it. But one of the chief aims of our mountain lovers and clubs now is to restore aboriginal names wherever possible. This alone ought to settle the matter in dispute: but in the pres- ent case there are strong personal re; sons w hy the original name should be retained. To say that Mount Tacoma has thirty-two thousand live hundred acres of ice and snow; that it covers, with its foot-hills, three thousand square miles, or twice the area    f the win de State of Rhode Island, is to give but a faint idea of its massive grandeur. From sea level it rears its head into the clouds three miles above; and though fifty miles from Tacoma, sixty from Seattle, so huge is it that it seems to be only ten miles aw ay and dominates all the landscape. To have such a mountain named after one is an honor indeed. Does Rear-Admiral Rain- ier deserve that incomparable honor ii  cur handy Should ice bestow it on a man whose sole claim :o historic mention is that lie was a British naval officer who fought to prevent the American people from se- curing their independence, and fought so hard that he was advanced to post rank If American patriotism did not suffice to answer that question, the American sense of humor would. I make another predic- tion. Rear-Admiral Rainier will, within a decade, share ilu fate ol the pro-slavery   lovernor Bigler of California, whose name was imposed for a time on the beautiful lake called Tahoe bv the Indians; and of the Farl ol Sandwich, after whom, for a number of years, our Hawaiian Islands were named. Return to the aboriginal   See the il  tails in Prof. E. S. Me.iny s " Vancouver's 1 Mm overy of Puget JSouud,  pp. 99-101. The Wisdom of Nature name in all these cases is in the direct line of progress. The restoration of the right name will be hastened by the fact that the city of Taco- ma, which was named after the mountain  the whole State would have been called Tacoma if President Roosevelt could have had his way , is the gateway to it and issues the railway folders. The growth within llie last ten years, of this city which is distin- guished for its splendid harbor; its stately streets, some a hundred feet, none less than eighty wide; and a site and environment pronounced by Henry Irving the most beau- tiful he had ever seen -would lie pointed at as a wonder were it not overshadowed by the still greater growth of Seattle, which had the advantage of being nearer Alaska. The Seattleites do not blink the fact that it is to the Alaska trade chiefly that they owe the size of their city, containing now over three hundred thousand inhabitants. The name chosen for their exposition    Alaska-Yukon-Pacific  proclaimed that fact loudly. The main incident of the ex- position was the unveiling of a monument to William H. Seward, who foresaw the value of Alaska when others called it   Sew- ard s Folly  because the enormous sum of seven million two hundred thousand dol- lars had been paid for it at his instigation. He guessed its value as a source of furs and fish, but he would have been as astonished as his opponents had any one foretold that the total wealth production of Alaska in thirty years  trom 1880  would exceed three hundred million dollars, and that in the twentieth century the annual value of canned salmon alone would be ten million dollars, while the yearly gold production would be three times the amount of the pur- chase price. And Alaska already has more than three hundred miles of railwavs. At the opening ceremonies of the Seattle Kxposition President James J. Mil  truly remarked that the growth resulting from the building of new railw ays is like that whit h follows the introduction of irrigation. In railroad building the North-west at present leads the country. 'There isalso everpresent the inspiration of other big jobs. The build- ing up of an    riental trade in the face of much competition is one of these. Another was the bringing of electric power forty miles from the Snoqualmie Falls. The most astonishing of them is the levelling of the hills on which the city is perched, a process which involves the removal, it is claimed, of more ground than any other modern un- dertaking except the Panama Canal. There is something truly inspiriting in such en- ergy. The middle-aged man feels in the first llush of youth again, eager to throw off his coat, put his shoulder to the wheel, and do his share in helping along this splen- did progress.

GEORGE CABOT LODGE By Edith    harton T would be impossible, I think, for any friend of George Cabot Lodge s to write ol the      et without first speaking of the man: and tiiis not only because his art was so   h ise t   his life, but also, and   hielly, bemuse, to those near enough to measun- him, his i haracter, liis temper, the   virtue in him, made his talent, distinguished as il was, a mere part of an abounding whole. A bun i lance  that is the word whii In omes to me whenever I try to describe him. I Mir- ing the twelve years of our friendship and from the very day that it began Iliad, whenever we were together, the sense   f his being a creature as profusely as he was linelv endowed. There was an exceptional delicacy in his abundance, and an extraor- dinan volume in lib delicacy. All this, on the day when he was first brought to see me a spring afternoon  i the year iS  S in Washington was lil up by a beautiful boyish freshness, wliiih, as the vears passed, somehow contrived to ripen without fading. In the first five minutes of our talk lie himself with the   haracteristic wholeness that made him so rare a friend: showing me all the sidis of his varied nature, the grave sense   f beauty, the dashing contempt of meanness, and that large spring of kindle laughter that comes to many onlv as a result of  hi- king tolerance of life. Il was one of his gifts thus to brush aside the preliminaries ot acquaintance and cuter at once, with i kind of royal ease, on the rights and prisi leges ot Iriendship; as though, one might think, with a foreboding of the short lim   giv en him to en j1  v them. Aside I nun this, however, there was nothing of the pathetically predestined in the young Cabot Lodge. Then and to the end he lived every moment to the full, and the first impression lie made was of a joyous physical lile. IJis sweet smile, liis easy strength, his deep eyes full of laughter and visions these struck one even before liis look ol intellectual power. I have sel- dom seen any one in whom the natural man was so wholesomely blent with the reflect- ing intelligence; and it was not the least of his charms  hat he sent such stout roots into the earth, and had such a hearty love for all he drew from it. Nothing was com- mon or unclean t   him but the vulgar, the base and the insincere, and his youthful impatience at the littleness of human na- ture w as tempered by an unusually mature sense of its humours. I might pause to speak of the acom- plishments that made his society, from the first, so refreshing and animating: for he was an admirable linguist, a good  Gre- cian." a sensitive lover of the arts, and possessed, on the whole, of the fullest gen- eral "culture  1 have ever known in a youth of his age. But even as I number his gifts 1 see how suffused they were for me by the glow of his beautiful nature, and how little what he knew ever counted in comparison with what he was; unless i. be exaeter to say that it counted precisely in proportion t   what he was. At any rate, his attainments did not. even in those days, single him out as much as his unusual gift of sympathy, and the range of his response to the imaginative call. As his voice that beautiful medium of line Knglish speech  i ould pass from the recital of Whitman or Leconte de Lisle to the vivid mimicry of some ex  liange of platitudes overheard in street or train, so liis mind flashed through  he same swil l transitions, and the boy who was dramatizing the broad humours of a tminicr  1c Montmartrt' would break off to tell how, at the end of a summer night in London, he had gone down to await the dawn on Westminster Bridge,  When oil ihut mighty heart was lying still.  One is accustomed, in enjoying the com- radeship of young minds, to allow in them for a measure of passing egotism, often the more marked in proportion to their sensi- tiveness to impressions; but it was Cabot Lodge s special grace to possess the sensi- tiveness without the egotism. Always as George Cabot Lodge free from pedantry as from conceit, lie un- derstood from the lirst the give and take of good talk, and was not only quick to see the other side of an argument Imt ready t   reinforce it by his sympathetic interpreta- tion. And because ol this responsiveness nf mind, and of the liberating, vivifying nature from which it sprang, he must al- ways, t   his friends, remain first of all, and most incomparably, a Friend. It was in the year of our meeting that   The Song of the Wave, by George Cabot Lodge,  was published by Charles Scrib- ner s Sons. When this earliest volume ap- peared. the young author  who had taken his degree at Harvard in 1 05 , had but lately returned from Paris, where, in close comradeship with his friend Joseph Sti  k- ney, he had spent two years in linguisti and historical studies at the Sorbonne. Perhaps, if measured with his later works, the most distinctive thing about  The Song ol the Wave  is its title. All his life long, George Cabot Lodge was a lover of the sea.  Come, said the Ocean. I have songs to sing, Aid need thine utterance.  This is the voice of his  call,  to which henceforth he always lent a yearning ear, and which was soon to lind a more indi- vidual utterance in  The Greek Galley.  the best poem of his second volume  pub- lished in 1Q02 , and to break into its full- est expression in the beautiful " Tucka- nuck  sonnets of  The Great Adventure 7  1905 . The sea was no mere symbol to him, nor his love of it a literary attitude. Living from childhood on the rocky New England coast, and spending long weeks of his dreaming studious youth on the lonely beach of Tuckanuck Island, oil Nantucket, he had as close a kinship as Whitman's with the element he sang, and sailing and swimming were the forms of exercise in which he most delighted. The sea is a great inspirer of song, but she lias been sung .so often and so long that she may be pardoned for sometimes repeating an old refrain in the ears of her new lovers. It was inevitable that George Cabot Lodge, like other young poets, should pass through the imitative stage of which his first three volumes give occasional proof, and equally inevitable that the voices of Whitman and Swinburne should be those oltenest heard in them.

And the same argument is put more forcibly in   loetlie s cry to Pc kemiunn :     Jriginality   What do people mean bv originality  Irom the moment   f our birth the world begins to react on us, and the only thing we can call our own is our etiergv, our power, our wjjl in other words, our re- action nil the world. 1 he first opportunity to test himself in this respect came tn Calx it Lodge, as it comes tn sn many, through a private grief - the death of his friend Stic kney; and in the sonnets commemorating this loss his verse lirst sounds a distinctly personal note. The one beginning:  At leasi,  ho saw , "wc spent with Socrates Some memorable flays, an l in our vout.i Were curious am. respectful of the Truth,  has a gallant ring of young defiance, but a more sustained level of beauty is reached in  Days.

He had already, in the year preceding the publication of " The   ire at Adventure,  attempted to give the subject an ampler and more phih sophic expression in the long dramatii poem called   Cain. In this volume his line sense of rhythm finds its first large opportunity, and the blank verse is ol a variety and an envcrgitre remarka- ble in a lirst effort of sui h length. Never- theless, intellectually and imaginatively he t ra versed a grea t distance in t he year I ie tween  Cain  and  The Great Adventure,  and three years after the latter book he brought out another dramatic poem  Ilerakles    in which the image lie had so patiently George Cabot Lodge s  -ught t" diape emerged .11 length I r  ni the marble.

It treed iiim from the tendency Lo 'Ira.' all his L-tlei ts l r..m liis inter e   icriem e. and mused him to a   en.eption of dramatic values. The subject he chose was ih.il;- nilicenl: llie labours of Ilerakles, like llie  passive resistance" of Prometheus, off.-r an inexhaustible theme to the poetic imag- ination. A page from T iodorus Siculus sums 11   the argument; but the author, in- dilfeicnl to aic ha-oli i;v, uses the legend .is the symbol of Ihe long labour of the soul if man, "dissatisfied, curious, unconvinced al last,  and ever, ill  .ioethe s phrase, go- ing "forward over graves.  As regards the growth of Cabot Lodge's arl, perhaps the most interesting thing in the volume aside from the more complex harmony ol the verse  is llie drawing nf Creon s   harat ter. Hitherto ihe poet's per- sonages had been mouth-pieces, but in the Theban King lie created a man, and the ease with w hi  h he "exteriorized" Cre- on's gond-humnure l diseiuhantmcnt and tolerant worldly   i   nm gave prnniise of a growing power to deal with his themes o - iei tively. This promise is reaffirmed in  'The Noctambulisf," one of the lmig poems of "The Soul's Inheritance,  the volume to which Cabot Lodge had put the li ni - h i ng touches just before his sudden death. The protagonist oi the poem is not, like Cleon, a   liarai Ier antithetical to his   real'.r.

Sin h memorable passages abound in " The Noctamlmlist,  and in its harmony of thought and form it remains perhaps the con.pletest product ol Cabot Lodge's art. An increasing beauty of versification marks this latest volume. I Iis was not the lyric muse. He "knew to build the lolty rhyme,  and the measured pace of blank verse, and the balanced architecture of the sonnet, best tilled the expression of his re- tlei live and discursive mind. It is it deed a detei i of some of his earlier verse that it deals too exclusively with general ideas expressed in abstract terms; but with the rminding of his rature lie had grown more sensitive to ihe appeal of the visible world. The a wa kening   f I his sense expresses itself in "Lnisnn,  another poem contained in the last volume. "So. in Ihe Inin.I'- re-nhent unity. Ail I'OMel' and pliases of the natural world Sliim. d Ihe one urge within, and we disi i-rned In   :t   ;    iipparcnt tilings 1 he stii il , i  tsv ; huh . theirs but tntrs." I lie i  u;ilily i if the Iasi lines sin nvs to what degree his verse was in process of beirg ett- George Cabot Lodge 230 riched by this sensibility to external beauty. Already it had given him nut only new images, but a new simplicity and directness of phrase. The lines:  Tin- mountain rose in power beneath our feel, Vestured in basalt and the endless grass" have a concreteness and a colour undiseov- erable in his earlier volumes. And ;t higher simplicity is reached in the poem called  Strength and Solitude.   We have laid down our ear to the dumb sod  We who are man and mortal as all tilings, Anri more and yet not otherwise than they  We have laid down our car and heard the earth Of graves and the innumerable grass Whisper to us. . . .  Here the beauty of visible things speaks no longer in images, but directly, without need of interpretation, in that fusion of thought and sense which makes the magic of poetry. From the first, Cabot Lodge had shown a. preference for the sonnet. Its structural severity appealed to his sense of form, and to the seriousness of liis poetic mood. In every volume from the  Poems  to  The Soul s Inheritance,  he gave this shape to some of the best expressions of his thought; and, as with his blank verse, so in the metric of his sonnets, the beauty of form grew with the growing richness of content. All through the sonnets there are fine passages, such as:  O Memory, Lord of broken ami broadcast Fragments of life, like scattered Cyclades Set in the dark illimitable seas Of Time-  and  May we . . . discern how earth and sky and sea, And love and life and death and destiny. Are wrought of one eternal element, Quarried in dim deep strata of the soul,  and single lines of insistent beauty, like the picture of Love:  With eyes of silence and with lips of song,  and the magnificent apostrophe to Silence:  Lord of the deserts  twixt a million spheres.  As his work progressed, the scattered graces were more often knit into a homo- geneous whole, and one comes on sonnets 1  f such completeness as  Questions,   Only the Dark   or  Cor Cordium    the latter marked by a beautiful inversion of the familiar sea-shell metaphor:   I hen, as it were against the inward ear, We hold, in silence, like a chambered shell, I lie ' 1   1 ono human heart -and stem to hr.ir .-orover and forever rise and swell And fail ond fall c,n I leath s eventual shore, Tragic: and vast, Life s inarticulate roar   In  The Soul s Inheritance  each of the longer poems leads up to a stately portico of sennets, in whose intercolumniations the gravely moving pentameters 1   se themselves like the garlanded figures of some Greek procession. Almost all these sonnets are line; and it is at once '.ragic and consoling for those who loved him and watched his progress with a jealous care, to note that the latest are the finest. Intellectually and plastically, he was nearing completeness in this form of verse; and how close he had come to it such a poem as this remains to prove.   liarth, sea and sky are rot as once they were To us: there is no aspect of all things, No pulse of heart or brain, n   whisperings Of truth's grave musie to the inward ear, Unaltered or unglorified: the mere Being of life, intense as song-swept strings. Is like a breathless sense of soaring wings Loosed in the spirit's boundless atmosphere  . . . We are not as we were  :_ nr feet have ranged The summits of imperishable hours; Life is a lordlier hope; and we, estranged In secret and at heart from all control, Walk in the wide new futures of the soul, Charged as with incommensurable powers  . . .  To part with him on this note is to pre- serve his image as it lives in the hearts that cherish him. To the end he travelled, seeking  new ranges for the feet of song,  and one leaves him on a height, with his face to the morning. Fur he, who had so irany gifts, had above all the gift of life; and that is the best, since it gives all the o.hers their savour. CIIAPEL IN THE BARRACKS By C. A.

Their faces all from home are set. Not memory holds them, nor regret; Yet one in dreams shall fold his sheep, One see again his father weep', One on the playground's narrow stage In mimic bat'.le oft engage; And as a child, unheeding, throws Lightly to ground his just-plucked rose, So, to the lard that gave them birth These toss their lives as little worth.  And we, whose portion is to lift From where is flung the priceless gift  We set the task they but fulfil; Theirs are the deeds but ours the will, To build, to wreck, to save, to slav, To pledge to-morrow for to-dav, To choose for guide the shine of gold Or star our fathers knew of old  And one shall lie in desert sands, And one where dawn lirst lights the lands.

T was in I ho store, as ho sal in the shadow.-, unnoticed, behind I he bigegg-sti ivc, t hat    illic Calker first le arnc-d    1 the danger whit. h threatened his happiness. Listening to Mr. Holmes and Mr. Killowill descanting 011 love and mat rim on v, he was finding much enjoyment in their philosophic com- ment on the motives of men and the minds of women, little dreaming that their vague allusions were to his mother and Mortimer berry. Then he was rudelv awakened to the truth. Mr. Holmes began to laugh in his sar- donic cackle.  It otter be a good thing for Willie to have a step-pa,  lie said, wagging hi- head sagely. "What that boy needs is some un with a legal right to keep him down. He s too in'open "on t, and I ligger Mortimer I Jerry ain't so am'able as he -cts Vi  I 1 i   In."

" Mv mother isnot settin  her cap for Mr. Uerrv. She's just tr  in  to reform him - that s what -lie's doin', and I know it.  Martin Holmes tapped the boy Vshoulder plavfully with Iii- cane.

Willie Calker pointed a Ihreatcning fore- finger at the old man.  I'll bet you He  1. p - etI. fur In- realized the impropriety   1 making hismo.her the subject   t a wager, and, moreover, as he ret ailed her casual rc- his feet, and pondcringovcr llie strange situ- ation which h id so suddenly risen in his life. Willie Calker had always realized the pos- sibility of hi:- having a step-father, but the idea of his mother picking one out for him was new and startling. That he should have had no voice in a matter so intimately concerning h m as the choice of a father was unfair, yet unavoidable; it was per- fectly i  ossibk  that his wishes regarding his t -  mlrriii     vcr Iii - strnrqe i  n mark' about Mr Berrv, giving evidence of her increasing interest in him, the odds see ill ei I t oo hca v il v in the st ranger V lavor to allow mui h risk on a reckless boast. "It wouldn t be riglv. fur me to bet." he added    iiicklv. "And I wouldn t aduise vou bellin  nulher,  snapped I.mien Killowill.   In fact, Willie, l;nowin  whal 1 know about weemen, and observin' what 1 observe in Sun day-si liool ai  1 on v mr pva .za, it would be wrong, downright wrong, for me to take you up. 15ul just tile same- "Just I he -aire, I ll have something to say about who'll be mv slcp-pa." cried the I  iv defiantly. Swinging his   a   lo his head, he pulled it down over his ears with a gesture of de- termination, squared his -houldcr , and strutted out of the store. Awa  from llie eyes and taunts "I the   oiupanv there, his bravado I led ; he broke into a run and never .slopped until he had reached the solitude of the meadows, where he lay in the shade ol the alders,    at  hitig the creek gurgling at step-father should be respected and very just. Vet his mother seemed to have no in- tention of consulting him. He did recall, one day at dimer, when she had asked him i asually how he liked Mr. Berry, ar.d on his giving expression lo his opinion, she had sighed and cautioned him not to speak so disrespectfully of those of whom ho knew so little. I low different it would have been had she looked at him in that same way, i arelesslv, vet archly, over the top of her leai up and a-ked what he thought of Har- vey llomer. 1 le did know Harvey Homer, that wholesome , whole-souled giant, who sang tenor. I jar v lone, and bass with equal fa- i iIit, and was the surest shot in the valley. He knew him as a man to whom any buy would be proud to claim relationship. On many a crisp jutuinn day they had hunted together on the ridges, and to the lad there  as no music like the deep-throated bay of the hound, the crackle of the brush, the riot ol the wind ard leaves: to him there was no well of wisdom like that from which he drank as he sprawled beside the noon-day The Lamb in Sheep s Clothing fire while Harvey, loquacious over his pipe, gave him of the riches of a wide experience. There was nothing in the world that Har- vey had not seen; nothing in the book of life that he did not know. But when, for- getful in the play of his fancy, the boy would place his friend in a nearer relation, the sub- paternal, carry' him from the clearing on the ridges to fill the vacant place in his own home, to sit with him in the evenings untangling fishing-lines and loading car- tridges, the delightful picture would fade away before the haunting presence of a wife and three children. Though without any unbearable pricks of conscience, he might consider with satisfaction the possi- bility of the sudden demise of Airs. Homer, he found it hard to proceed mentally to a slaughter of the infants, and even with their mother comfortably disposed of, he realized that much as he might desire Harvey for a father, he would equally abhor such im- pedimenta as sisters. The very remote pos- sibility of attaining Harvey Homer under satisfactory conditions made doubly hard the pressing danger of Mortimer Berry. Mrs. Calker was right when she declared that her son knew little of Mr. Berry. Indeed,no one in Six Stars knewr much of him. for he had come there hardly a month before from Harmony, and Harmony lies over the mountains. A small man, and one so fastidious as he, could hardly be expected to meet a boy s approval, but the whole village was unfavorably impressed when on the Sunday after he had taken board at the Killowill s he appeared in church wearing a blue and white blazer and white tennis shoes; and of these early critics none was more severe than Mrs. Calker. She expressed herself very openly on a man given to such vain display, who sat all morning on the Killowill s porch sunning himself, and spent the afternoon pitching quoits with Mr. Holmes and his cronies. But a sudden reversal of her opinion was brought about when he joined her Bible class, and quickly proved himself the aptest scholar in a company rang- ing in years from seventeen to seventy. Did she ask  What did he then do   Mr. Berry always had the answer, and so versed was he in the distances from Marah toElim and from Elim lo Jor- dan, and in the problems of who begat whom, that he was soon established as a court of appeal, and it became the custom of the teacher to refer to him all disputed points, marking him thus as an example to be followed. Naturally, such favoritism did not heighten Mr. Berry's popularity with his fellows. Naturally, loo, Mrs. Cal- ker's good opinion of him increased when lie abandoned quoits and became a regular afternoon visitor at her house. As out- spoken as she had been in his disparage- ment she now was in his praise. Even Mr. Killowill s plaint that the stranger had not paid a dollar of board met with small sym- pathy from her. Ah  Air. Killowill should rejoice in this opportunity to feed one of Heaven s sparrows  But Mr. Killowill did not rejoice. He retorted that not only was the sparrow feeding at his expense, but he was also comfortably ensconced in the best double room on the sunny side of the house, and was most insistent about not having to make his own bed and carry his own water. It was this conversation of Mrs. Calker and Mr. Killowill that gave rise to the first surmises as to the real cause of her regard There was nothing in the world that Harvey had nut  een. 241 The Lamb in Sheep s Clothing for Mr. Berry, and in several quarters there was soon evident an ill-concealed jealousy of the stranger, for the widow was a decided catch. The exact amount of her fortune was not known, but it was certain that it was built on the solid foundation of a pen- sion of twelve dollars monthly, her husband having served through nine months of the Civil War and come to an untimely end while shooting wild turkeys. Air. Berry s sole possessions seemed to he his amiable manners and his good clothes, and when there came to his view a means of support so clearly visible as a widow of property, when he joined her Bible class and aban- doned quoits for her company, the cynical world was quick to chargc him with mer- cenary motives. When Mrs. Calker in mis- sionary meeting suddenly interrupted a discussion of the natives of Allabalarad to announce her intention of remaining true to the memory of her late husband, the cynical world was equally ready to aver that she would soon marry again. The only person in the village who had not some opinion or theory on the mind of Airs. Cal- ker, or the motives of Air. Berry, was the widow s son, for he had been so occupied with lishingand shooting that he had viewed with blind complacency the stranger s in- vasion of the home piazza, little dreaming that he planned a permanent settlement there. The idle discussion of Air. Holmes and Air. Killowill had aroused him to liis danger, and now he lay alone in the mead- ows searching the sky for some way to ward it off. The more he thought of the little man with his light blue eyes, his soft voice, his blue and white blazer, the deeper grew his aversion. The gorgeous coat be- came to him a sheepskin that hid the lion. He hated him and feared him, though from him he had met nothing but kindness. He saw now only condescension in the cheerful greeting, confidence of power in the jovial camaraderie, sinister motive in the deferen- tial friendliness. Beat him, he must  But how  In vain ho sought in the blue foi an inspiration. A July day when the sun beats down from a cloudless sky so you can see the ether waving over the fields does not stir the blood to action, so he lay with body listless and brain whirring, for hours, till the medley of village supper bells called him homeward. He ran in sheer desperation, an aimless race, save that for the moment he forgot his troubles, and lie never halted till lie had hurdled through the garden and reached the kitchen steps. There he paused, for the wailing notes of the melodeon came to him, with his mother s voice as she sang her favorite song and his. It brought back to him their many long evenings together, as he sat curled up in the big rocking-chair watching her and listening. Confused with this picture rose the threatening figure of Mortimer Berry, and he wanted to run to her and invoke her by the memory o: their long companionship, not to let anyonecome between them not even Harvey Homer. But there was in her voice a strange note that stayed him, a note more languidly sentimental than he had ever heard before.   I never was worthy of you, Dooglas Not half worthy the like of you. Now all men beside seem like shadows, I love you, Dooglas Dooglas, tender and true.  The melodeon seemed to have caught Ms mother s mood, and the wailing interlude chilled his heart. Full of fear, he tiptoed around the house and peered through the sitting-room window. Airs. Calker was at the little organ and close beside her, brilliant even in the twi- light by the colors of his coat, sat Alortimer Bern.', leaning forward and gazing at her in adoration. When her hands had wavered over the keys in a last feeble plaint, she swung around on the stool and faced him.  It is beautiful,  he exclaimed.  Do you know. Airs. Calker, it always makes me a better man to hear you sing    Oh, don t say that, Mr. Berry," the widow returned in a hushed voice, and tum- inghereyes to the Rogers groupin thedistant corner, she let them rest there pensively. Air. Berry was persistent.   It docs,  he cried, slapping his knee in emphasis. Airs. Calker still avoided his eyes.   The world is so full of darkness,  she said,   that those of us who have oil should keep our lamps trimmed and bumin .    li ever   Air. Berry waved a striped arm,  if ever a woman used her talents right you do, Airs. Calker. Where would I be to-day, if it wasn t for your teaching  In the gutter in the gutter.  Airs. Calker could not imagine such a descent for the immaculate Mr. Berry. She The Lamb in Sheep's Clothing 245 protested and, turning to the melodeon, touched a few soft chords.  But you are so good that you cannot understand,  Mr. Berry persisted.   You don t know how really bad a man can be. Why, there s not a commandment 1 haven t broke at some time or other. My poor old mother was killed by the way I carried on, and now, since you have brought me to see the light, I feel like I had murdered her.  The striped arm waved again.  Sin- nin , Mrs. Calker, was my speciality.    But you never actually stole or did tilings theycould put you in jail for,  said the widow gently. Mr. Berry quickly reassured heron that point.   You see I went in more for the wices, but now, as I look back, I realize it sagreat deal worse to lead a man into swearin.  and gam- Ijlin  and dancin , than just to steal his buggy whip. Oh, Mrs. Calker, Mrs. Calker   The memory of t li a t evil past brought tears to Mr. Berry s eves.  Yoj mustn t carry on so,  said Mrs. Calker soothingly.   If ever a man re- pented and reformed you have.   Bu: how can I forget the homes I ve ruined,  returned Mr. Berry in a choking voice;   the young men I ve led into wicked ways, the mothers whose hearts I ve broke. Was it a wonder they drove me out of Har- mony; that I came here an outcast       You was guided to Six Stars.  said Mrs. Calker.   Yes, I was guided.  Mr. Berry smiled feebly.  One day I came, mocking-like, to Sunday-school, and you taught me, and your teachin  changed my whole life. What I am to-day I owe entirely to you.  By adroitly juggling his chair, Mr. Berry brought himself still closer to the widow, and now, as her hands hung listlessly on the keys and her face was lurnod from him, lie began to apeak in a clear incisive tone.  What don t I owe to you   lie asked solemnly.   I hinkofit a young man born wi'.h ever ' opportunity, throws  em all away an I plunges into the depths lill liis name becomes a by-word for wrong in liis walley. He is driven out.

He is over- whelmed with sor- row," .Mr. Berry went on, unheeding.   He sorr iws     r his wasted past. He vows he will go back home an rl 1 ive it down   redeem him- self -make his name blessed in the walley, but when the lime comesforhim topart, he realizes--  "   Mi.

I have taken holt,  cried Mr. Berry.   Now what will become of me if you let go   Mr. Berry shuddered. Mrs. Calker studied the Rogers group.   Will you let go    camel he appeal again, enforced by the outstretched arms. The widow flushed furiously, and to hide her confusion began to strike random chords on the melodeon.  What shall I do   she exclaimed.  I can't see you drownded again.    And you won t, will you     Hope rang in Mr. Berry s voice.   You won t ruin the life you ve saved   You won t-  1 hear some one outside,  Mrs. Calker cried, springing from her seat and running to the window. Mr. Berry followed her. They heard the rattle of bushes and the beat of flying feet, and together they leaned over the sill, trying to pierce the enclosing darkness, but could see nothing. They called, and only a whippoorwill answered them. The boy was gone. He had slipped around the corner of the house and fled down the village street. It seemed to him that he was homeless now, that he had been turned out into the night without even a refuge from the coming storm. For when he paused a moment at the store, hesitating, the words of Martin Holmes came back to him with his own idle boast, anil he feared to face the taunts of his intimate enemies. He ran on, wanting to be alone, to sit in silent thought and bring order to the riot of his brain. Where could he   Not at home with his mother at the melodeon singing to the triumphant Mr. Berry. In the mead- ows  By the mill-dam  Darkness was closing in those favorite retreats of his, and they were haunted by giant shapes, none the less terrible because he knew them to be trees thrashing wildly in the wind. He looked out to them from the bridge; then turned back timidly, more ready to meet the jeers of the store company than to go on to unknown perils. His refuge proved better than he had hoped, for it was the supper hour, and, peering through the smutted glass of the door, he saw a solitary man within, a mysterious stranger in black, black hat, black beard, black clothes, sit- ting by the stove, eying it critically as he smoked. At once the boy s thoughts turned from his own troubles to the identity, char- acter, and history of this solemn person. How he had come to Six Stars was plain, for a strange horse and buggy were hitched at the rail. But why he had comc, and why he was sitting thus in profound melan- choly, alone, in the gloom of the store, was a mystery worth probing. His mood seemed akin to Willie s own  Had he been threat- ened with a step-father he could not have been more dejected; so the boy felt drawn to him. But knowing it to be bad manners to thrust himself directly on a stranger, he softly opened the door, tiptoed to the end of the bench, and shuffled along until he was beneath the sad black eyes. They regarded him quietly but he got no word of greeting.   Good-evenin ,  said Willie pleasantly. The stranger gave him a gloomy nod.   Mebbe you mowt be from Pleasant- wille,  ventured Willie, after a moment. The other shook his head. Willie Calker was not abashed, for he was accustomed to the difficulties, of making acquaintances. Picking a stick frnm the scuttle, he whittled it contemplatively for some time, and then, looking up, remarked:  Well, mebbe you mowt be from East Canaan.  A faint smile showed through the black beard, but the reply was a weary shake of the head.  Well, mebbe you mowt n t be from Buzzard s Glory.  The strangertook his pipe from hismouth and gazed with reproach at his small in- quisitor.   You hadn t otter ast so many questions sonny,  he said.   I m not astin  questions,  was the retort in the pleasantest possible tone.  I m just guessin . I guess you are a drummer.  Now Willie Calker knew well enough that drummers were a resplendent folk who wore fine raiment, and that this gruff giant in top-boots was as far from them in glory as Solomon from the lilies. More- ovei, he was perfectly aware thal uo drum- mer would linger near Six Stars when night was falling, but rather would press on to Pleasantville and the luxuries of the Eagle. Yet, not being able to learn directly any- The Lamb in Sheep s Clothing -47 thing of the stranger s history, he hoped to glean a little by a process of elimination. This suggestion was quickly eliminated, a loud guffaw greeting it.   Well, mebbe you've run away from home,  Willie went on i heerfully. This proved too much even lor so phleg- matic a temperament. A great hand shot forward and caught the hoy's knee. "I might as well give in.  the- stranger said.  ' Barker is my name Morris K. Bar- ker.

That decided Mr. Barker. If there was one man in the world he wanted to see, il was Mortimer Berry, to tell him how muc h he was missed in Harmony, and to carry him a word of comfort and good cheer. So, without further resistance, he turned up his coat collar and suffered himselt to be led forth into the rain. Bi t Mortimer Berry did not reciprocate his friend s delight. Wlu.t he was saying to Mrs. Calker when the door suddenly opened to admit the vis- itor matters little" That Mrs. Calker gave a muffled scream of cm jarrassment is of 24S The Lamb in Sheep s Clothing more importance. She saw a stranger, a great ominous-looking man, standing in the doorway regarding Mr. Berry solemnly, whether with good or evil intent she could not tell, and her son was hidden from her by the mighty black bulk, which he was trying to move onward by quick importu- nate jabs.   How could you   cried the widow, ris- ing in confusion. " It s only Mr. Barker,  came in Willie s reassuring voice.   He s cume to supper and to see Mr. Berry.  Evidently Mr. Berrv did not appreciate the attention, for he sidled to the distant end of the settee, yet he was not in time to avoid the embrace of his friend. Before he could speak he was lifted to his feet, held at arm's length, and regarded lovingly.  Well, well, Sunshine," exclaimed Mr. Barker in a voice that filled the room.   Its like a breath of fresh air to see you again. Allow me to congratulate you, Mrs. Calker, on your choice. There never was a better man in Harmony than him, a sweeter char- acter. a nobler-   Oh, don'l say that, Morris.  protested Mr. Berry, struggling feebly to free himself.   I will say it, snapped Mr.Barker.   Do you think 1 am ungrateful  Mrs. Calker if it had not been for this good man I d be in the gutter to-day, and I m proud of it. He redeemed me.  To the widow these tidings seemed any- thing but glad. The indignant face with which she had first confronted Mr. Barker was now turned to Mr. Berry, and, for- getting appearances, she put on her spec- tacles, and they magnified the gaze full of disappointment and reproach with which she regarded him silently. Seeing the course of his mother s anger, Willie sidled to her and slipped his arm through hers.  Tell how Mr. Berry nursed the sick,  he cried. Mr. Barker sank down on the settee, tak- ing his friend with him, and pinned him there by an arm thrown affectionately across the shoulders. Crossing his legs and mak- ing himself comfortable as though he were fixed for the evening, he beamed on his prisoner with an expansive smile. " I would keep you all night if I started to tell you half the good things our Sun- shine has done,  he said. Mrs. Calker dropped into the rocking- I would keep you all night if I started to tell you half the good things our Sunshine has done  The Lamb in Sheep s Clothing 249 chair. Reaching out for her boy's hand, she drew him closer to her side, but never for an instant did she take her eyes from the white face of Mr. Berry.   Is what Mr. Barker says true   she asked in a quaver- ing voice. The answer was a hard cough.  Is it   she persisted, speaking louder.   Morris doesn t know what a sinner I really was,  falt- ered Mr. Berry Mr. Barker smiled more generously.  That s our Sun- shine all over,  he exclaimed.  He alius was the modestest man, Mrs. Calker, alius talked so humble-like, yet there is more than one in Harmony as owes their lives to his upliftin  power. You ll be glad to hear, Mortimer, that just the other day old Mrs. Zook was tollin  me how you had saved her boy Arthur, how you had set up nights nursin  him through airysepelas. Why, since you left, your Sunday-school class has all fell apart and-   Didn t Mr. Berry break his poor old mother s heart   demanded Mrs. Calker in a sharp tone.  Break his mother s heart   cried Mr. Barker, with a gesture of protest.  Why, ma am, he was the light of that dear wom- an s eyes.

And as I was sayin -  It was Mrs. Calker who interrupted him now. She rose.

And I thought I had saved you,  she said, shaking her head sadly.  You did   Mr. Berry leaped to his feet and freed himself. He made one step toward her, only lo be chocked by her hos- tile gaze.  You might as well talk of savin angels,  said Mr. Barker, catching at the striped coat and trying to draw his friend back to him.  He ll be a great sperkitual help to you, ma am, I m sure. Now won t you set down while I continue   Mrs. Calker ignored his appeal and, drawing herself up to militant womanliness, strode to the door.  You must excuse me,  she said.  Good-by, Mr. Barker.   You won t let me fall again   cried Mr. Berry in a voice of despair.  I must get Willie s supper,  she an- swered over her shoulder, as she moved down the hall toward the kitchen.   I had otter done it long ago.  A moment later the front door closed. The widow heard it and, running to th  The Point of View  vind i v, peered out into the rain.

Narrow -minded invtsliga- turs are always ini lined to proclaim actual bor- rowing whenever t lev can show that a thought voiced I iv one poet has been rephrased bv a later poet in the same words and perhaps with the aid of the same figure. Manv an echo of iii is sort from the classics of I Greece and Rome has been discovered in the pages of Siake- s n ;ir ', nnd yet V.. jusscrund felt convinced that most of them were accidental coincidences rather than actual recollections, conscious or unconscious; and it occurred to him lo ask the opinion of Sully-l rudlionime. So he collected three passages from the French poet's own works to which he had found striking parallels, one in an earlier French lyrist and two others in tin  English Drayton and Crashaw; and he asked the I rencli : oet it he had been fa iiiliar with these predecessors Sully lYudhomnie answered that In had never read the ba ds from whom he might be .s'ijiposed t i have borrowed.  I console mv- s' I  f"r ii iv early ignorance,  lie wrote,  by the thought that if .1 h id known, before 1 rhymed, all dial had been written on love, the pen would have fallen fr  m my hands; 1 would have rec- ognized in others mv own emotions, and even in their lives circumstances analogous to those which had aroused them in mine. I confess, to my shame, that I was too ignorant to be a plagiary" And he then asserted that a poet, except perhaps in the narrative pirt of his works or occasionally in the strangeness of his ways of feeling,   offers nothing new lo his read- ers and does not pretend to do so; he procures them oiilv the satisfaction of recognizing them- selves. The human heart is the common means of communication turned to account by poetry; it offers in all poets the same gamut of senti- ments, but with a different ring." And as M. Jusscrand justly observes,  this ring, this originality, was  ire-eminently Shake- speare's.   And what Shakespeare possessed pre-eminently other poets have also had, each in his own degree. There is no need to sup- pose that Longfellow was consciously echoing   ioethe fin  Wilhelm Meister   when he wrote  Tell me not in mournful numbers.  Hut, on the other hand, Baudelaire had nour- ished himself on our American poets before lie composed the Ivric on bad luck in which he declared that  Tart cst long  and that " Mon co: ur, coniine un tambour voile, Y.  battant tics marches funtrbrcs.  And Baudelaire it was who carried over into The Point of View French poetry Gray s  full many a gem,  turning it into   Maine jov.iu doi i cn; e  .-li Dans 1l s lunebrcs   i l'oiiiili." Ii Poe had lived In set' these transparent pur- loinings of liis translator, probably not even gratitude would have prevented liis denouncing Baudelaire as bitterly as he denounced " 1 -ong- fellow and other plagiarists.  Whatever the rest of the world might be willing to believe, Poe would have insisted that he had caught the French poet in Ihe act. Indeed the case against Baudelaire seems lo be prettv t lear; but so was the case against Sully -1 'rudhomme; so, in fact, is the case against Shakespeare. And Poe himseli, for all his indignation, was not unwilling on occasion to snatch up uncon- sidcred trilies. He was inclined to damn llie sin he had a mind to. Fur example, Coleridge was one of his admirations; and Coleridge said in his   Biographia Literaria  that the real and the manufactured poem look alike from a dis- tance, although the difference between them  is not less than between an egg and an egg- shell.   Now Poe, in his  Marginalia,  de- clared that Mrs. Mo watt s comedy of   I ashii  n  resembled the  School for Scandal" much as the shell of a spent rocket resembles the rocket itself. But after all this is a simile that might very well have been original with Poe only this is a possibility he would have denied in the case of another than himself. After all, was originality really possible in   the so-called nineteenth century   liven the Almighty Dollar, which we Americans are sup- posed to worship, must have been a minor god of the Germans before we bowed down before it; and it was then only a Thaler. The Jap- anese jinrikisha was invented by a Yankee missionary, so we are told; Saint Patrick was a Frenchman and Saint George was a Cappadocian before he was naturalized in England. IT may seem presumptuous for any one, even at this distance of time, to write down as a topic for discussion Laurence Sterne's pet theme, but a feeling of envy com- pels me, roused by comparing his world with my own.

It is not that I have none of mv own, but that I tan get no chance lo ride. I am, and always have been, the peculiar prey of hobby riders ol all kinds, and, as I once heard a dis- tinguished lei lurer say to a distinguished bos- ton audience, of all sexes. Perhaps this imnts from a vacuity of countenance in nu which suggests a lack of inner inter' sis, or from a skill in concealing my own hobbies, of which I have a whole stud, or, 1 should sa , held, as most of them are wild. Never can I find time to train even the colts among them; I ha I is probably the reason w hy they boh when 1 find a chance to mount one of them. The trouble is that a hobby-rider seldom spies my face without coming toward me at a canter; So- cialist. Naturalist, Anarchist, are after me by turns. Hv nature I am a good listener and a bad speaker, having always had a wrett hed habit ol lending an ear and letting other peo- ple talk. It may be sheer laziness; it may be a foolish love of giving pleasure, and a feeling that these excited monologues do nobody any harm. In a world where so many people have missions it often strikes me that the prophets outnumber their congregations, the shepherds their Hocks. Influencing others for their good is one of llie subtlest forms of hu- man pleasure; why should 1 not allow these enthusiasts to feel it, when il costs me so little to play for llie moment the part of possible disciple, knowing as I do at ihe bottom of my hardened heart that nobody can convert me to anything  Reasoning in this foolish and feminine- wav, I get my just deserts, for one and all they pounce upon me, looking on me as good raw material, needing only the touch of this or that lirm linger to be shaped to great ends. A Spiritualist once told me that, under her guidance, T could become a rare medium, yet I knew then as now that I should make hint a second-rate Spiritualist. An impassioned friend continually insists that I should make 252 The Point of View a good Socialist; now T rould never make a good Socialist until I find out what a Socialist is, though this consideration does not seem to deter many another person. Thus, among riders of hobbies, 1 am tom asunder, I who am but an indifferent horsewoman. Trot, pace, canter it is all thesame tome. Theridersbring up with glowing faces, and turn to see how much good it has done me, who have been clinging fast, as best I might, without saddle or even pillion. The puzzling thing about all this is the con- viction of each rider that the path his steed takes is the only one there is. It is amazing that, in the face of life, with its many-sided- ness, its bewildering complexities, its contra- dictions, its paradoxes, so many people exist, blind to the real nature of the demand made upon them, sure that some single evil accounts for all wrong things, sure that some single change will set all right.

There, I reflected, as she spoke the last word, is one sect that never dies, one church forever full, one congregation frequented as much by men as by women Our newspapers, our lecture halls, the very air of the streets are full of shrill monomaniac dogma, while the person who has no single explanation of the manifold to offer feels as Mrs. Shandy, hobby-less in a world of hobbies, or as the little pig I once saw at Bostock s in the comer of the monkey- cage, a poor, wretched, little white pig, tor- mented by its clever neighbors, ricden by them, squealing at each tweak of ears or tail. Listening to many an eloquent presentation of this or that cure-all, I have felt like that little pig who had no ruling idea except a de- sire to get out of the cage.

FIELD OF A RT   the BOSTOX ai:t ursriM BOSTON S in w Museum of l-'ine Aris is open at last. Indeed, it is ungracious to say  al last,  since the edifice has reallv been built in a surprisingly short time. It was only the other day that we were looking at the plans for the museum, and now behold  all is finished. It is a question whether build- ings are best when made so fast, but certair exigencies in this case required speed. Tfce question of light for  he museum was one which engaged for a long time the altentioi of the directors, of the trustees, and of the architects. A mysterious little building was erected on the ground where the museum was soon to be built; a little building which was a. source of wonder and speculation to many of the uninitiated. Here al sorts of elaborate experiments in lighting were tried, and here some, at least, of these questions were solved. The matter of lighting for pictures was taken up; of lighting for sculpture, for the light t Ii at is good for a picture is not necessarily good lor a statue, and, again, different pictures often seem to need different lights. It cannot be said that all these questions have been solved satisfac- torily, but, at least, an effort has been made. Museums before now have not always been built on the best lines. A museum has been somewhat a matter of chance. Many of them, as the Louvre in Paris, or the old Luxembourg or the Utlizi and the I itti museums, have been old palaces remodelled for newer needs. Sontt of the later German museums are remarkable, in that they arc carefully adapted to present- day requirements. Vet what is the best solu- tion of the problem in Germany  need not necessarily in America be .he only way. There are many things to be considered: the climate, the objects shown, the temperament of the peo- ple who are to sec the exhibits. With all these things n view a committee was formed, a committee of three, who should go about Europe, see the best museums, and make plans and suggestions for a museum even better than all the others. Two of these gentle- men were architects. The third was a  'lay- man.'1 They duly and dutifully saw all, or at least many, of 111  various museums, and pre- pared a report on these things on their return to America. '1 he report was presently drawn and pre- sented. it contained accounts of the various museums visited, comments thereon, and sug- gestions ol what might be done, what avoid'd, in a museum. An architect was chosen, and then with the assistance of hints from these gen- tlemen and ol suggestions from another archi- tect the plan of the present museum was pro- duced. It is fell that, while nothing, naturally, is perfec t, tin s plan has made a Step or two in the question of making museums. A good di al of thought has been given to the lighting, as well as to the distributing and grouping, of the rooms of the various apartments. It may be said that there are two fundamen- tally  different ideas as to the end anil the aim of a museum. One idea is that a museum should be a sort of storehouse of everything beautiful or interesting that has ever been done in the past; if not originals, then reproductions. M oreover, that al  these things should be ex- posed together, with proper printed comment, with a view of educating and edifying the pub- lic. as well as delighting it. The other idea i-. that a museum should re- unite and show .1 few exquisitely beautiful originals; as mnnv as may be had, but in these davs the  number for one- museum is feyv. II other things accrue, let them be stored in some accessible way, so that students and experts may siudv them when net essary. '1 lie holders of this idea believe that the people are more elevated, that their caste is belter stimulated by the sight of a lew very beautiful things arrayed in the best possibl:- setting; that, on the other hand, the public appetite is rather jaded by a huge hodge-podge of more or less interesting specimens. There is something to be said for this last idea. A German on going through an American collection of casts said, cab ihis a museum; yve call it a magazine." -53 The Field of Art In arranging ibis Hosion Museum some- thing of a c  iti h iur.i'   lias 1 h i m cllected. I or instance, in llie .scul vture gallery the beaulilul originals in marble, terra cotta, or bronze are ex  om iI in .small rooms, without too much surroundings. l lie casts, on the other hand, are shown down-M.sirs in larger rooms. I lie question as to whether il is worth while to have casts exhibited publicly in a high-class museum is one that is much discussed. In Trance the Louvre contains practically nothing but origi- nal marbles. Casts of these and other statues are shown in minor museums, like that ol the Kcole des Beauv-Arls or lhat of the Trocadero. A cast, after all. as some one has said, only shows about the amount of water that would be displaced bv the original, and from an arlis- tie point of view il is not wholly satisfactory. One would not, in a large, important museum, fill up a great space with autotypes and copies of famous paintings, and the opponents of casts feel that casts occupy much the same position as regards originals. Doubtless, as the museum acquires more and more original marbles, the casts, some of them fine old battle-scarred relics of the Athenwum, will one by one be allowed to complete their disintegration in peace and solitude.  .1 I ca'itr hlcssf, I'ombre ct le silence." W illi the Japanese collection, on the other hand, the tendency has been to show compara- tively few things and to store a great many in such a way that properly accredited students and scholars may easily study them. This course has, indeed, been pursued almost from necessity, since the department possesses such an enormous amount of interesting material that il would be impossible to exhibit it all. Naturally much the same plan has been fo - 1 iwed in the  Jray Print Collection, which con- tains such an immense number of line things that only a selection can possibly be displayed. In the picture gallery there is not quite llie same difficulty, since there is more wall space Ilian there are line pictures. There are various new pictures here, but it must be admitted that the thins of the collection are certain paintings which have already belonged for some lime to the museum. There is, to be sure, Cour- bet's magnificent  Hunting Scene,   which, taken all in all, is the most satisfactory thing In- ever painted, lint that has been lent to the museum by Mr. Henry Savles, the present owner, for various periods during the last fif- teen years. So that, on the whole, one returns to certain old loves among the pictures without concerning one s self loo much about the newer ones. There are one or two, perhaps half a dozen, pictures which one could show to any stranger, confident that they are among the fine or unique things in the world of art. One of the most remarkable pictures in the museum is the "Money Lender,  by Gabriel Metsti. One cannot recall so fine an example ol this master in any of the European galleries. The painting of all llie details is excellent, but the painting of the woman's face is particularly remarkable. Indeed, Metsu in this painting appears to have made a picture which is among the best works bv the Dutch masters. Many of Metsu's pictures are ruined, or at least lim- ited, by the subject or motij, but here is a sub- ject excellent in itself and one which admits of unlimited development. Metsu here has made realism so wonderful a thing that one perceives the beautv that lies in light and character. Another picture much liked by artists is a little still-life by Jean Baptist Simeon Chardin, made np of a few of the simplest elements: a dead chicken, a stone jug, and some other things put together in just the right way. It is one of the aforesaid half-dozen pictures which are among the museum's choicest. It is not entirely without faults. It is of that stony text- ure which one often notes in Chardin's work. But the rendering, spot for spot, of the general masses in this picture could hardly be surpassed. It is, indeed, one of the finest pictures made by the master of still-life. Pictures which have made a good deal of lalk are Rubens's portrait of a man  sup- posed l" be his first teacher  and of his wife. There is also a supposed N an Dyck, though  his is admittedly a studio picture: that is, a replica painted in the studio of the master, re- touched in part by him. It must be confessed that the canvas is not a very exciting one. The Rubens is of more interest because painted in a more forthright manner. It is curious that it should be supposed to be of Rubens s first master, since the man is quite young looking. It surely could not be Adam de Noort, since Jordaens s pictures of him as the King in his numerous Bean Feasts represent de Noort as a much older man. Among these comparatively new pictures is a little interior by Brekelenkam. Brekelenkam is one of those men from whom one is always expecting a great deal and in whom one is always being a little disappointed. The trouble is largely in his color, which is a trifle hoi,  foxy,  and snuffy in quality The picture The Field of Art 255 here exhibited is an interesting one, though one finds the color to be the weak point. It is full of Hollander character, however. The little figures seated o la Turque are full of character and are skilfully touched in. One of the best of the new instalments, per- haps the best, is Van der Vliet s fine interior of a church. One feels that if this man had painted small interiors his work would have been as fine, in many respects, as that of De Hooch, Vermeer, and others. Naturally one notes the two Velasquezes, the  Carlyle  portrait group and the much-dis- cussed  Philip IV. Portrait.  But these pict- ures have been so much fought over that it would not be profitable to discuss them in a short paper. There are a number of other in- teresting pictures; a  St. Luke drawing the Madonna,  attributed to Roger Van der Wey- den, a curious Michael Wolgemut, a Carlo Crivelli, a Franz Ilals of average quality, and the almost notorious  Slave Ship  of Turner. The  Portrait of Cardinal Pallavicino,  by- El Greco, is the finest single portrait byTheoto- copuli which one remembers to have seen. Al- though it has some of his.strange mannerisms, it also has many of his more admirable traits. The color quality of the blacks and whites in this thing is magnificent, and from more than one bit one divines how Velasquez may have learned, from studying the work of the Greek, how to change the rather stiff and stodgy tech- nique learned from Herrera and Pacheco to the limpid, flowing handling which we think of when we say  Velasquez.  Curiously enough, one of the most popular pictures here is Sully s  Tom Hat.  The students of the art school near by are constantly copying it. There are always two or three names down for this purpose. Strange to say, the next most popular picture among the copy- ists is Degas s painting of  Race Horses,  than which one can imagine no greater contrast. The  Tom Hat,  by the way', is not entirely without merit: it is of the style of picture which is fondly called  attractive.  Ajiother picture which is a favorite with copyists is Bargue s im- mensely clever and marvellously finished little figure, a man in some sort of Albanian costume. There are several very fine Millets here, notably the picture  The Harvesters,  which is sometimes called  Ruth and Boaz.  This was bequeathed to the museum by the late Martin Brimmer and, while its interest is not so poignant as in some of Millet s other pict- ures, it remains one of his most ambitious at- tempts and in some ways it is one of the most complete of his paintings. The group of bestial satyr-like harvesters is well conceived and worked out. The design of that group espe- cially is particularly fine. Again, the famous  Shepherdess,  which one has often heard described, is very well placed, a little high it might seem at first glance. But, after all, dignity is the key-note of this picture and it is not amiss to have it enthroned, as it were, above other pictures. Another in- teresting picture is one by Theodule Ribot, whose black pearls seem to have grown duller as the years go by. His picture of scullions is painted in a full, juicy way. It is curious among the mass of French pict- ures, mostly representing the Romantic phase, to come on so cold and classic a performance as Gerome s celebrated   L Eminence Grisc.  Gerome, rather overrated at one time, is now, perhaps, a little underrated. People do not wholly realize the immcnse tcchnical skill pos- sessed by this man, a skill, technical, in spite of the fact that his touch was a little dry. Cer- tainly in this picture the draperies look a little hard, the color a little garish in some places. Yet from a dramatic point of view the compo- sition is admirable. Whether one wants drama in pictures is another matter. There are certain new pictures in the collec- tion of modern paintings. Among these is E. C. Tarbell s latest work, and a very fine thing it is. It is the fashion to say that his work is like the finest Dutch painting, but in many respects it is quite different. The arrangement, to be sure, is in something the same spirit, but in the later man s work there is a sense of design which no Dutchman, except Vermeer, and he only in a few works, ever dreamed of. In the matter of color values again there are nuances in the modern s work which the older men never even attempted. In short, TarbeU s work is thor- oughly modern, though he avoids some of the pitfalls that modernists have digged for themselves. Another one of the Boston men who have interested themselves in this sort of work is Mr. W. M. Paxton. His picture of two young women at a tabic has remarkable qualities of observation and rendering. It would be hard to make a thing more realistic in the broad sense of the word. The values of the  spot- ting  arc indicated with remarkable justness, and yet it is in no sense petty realism. Where the thing is most remarkable, indeed, is in the way it  carries.  The picture tells perfecdy The Field of Art well across the room, vet when one looks at it near to, one finds that it is finished very lar as well. Beside the various pictures of note, there are certain other things of which the museum is especially proud; for instance, the head of   Aphrodite" in the Bartlett Collection, the   I lomer," and a Ri man terra-cotta heatl: also a certain very wonderlul Persian boy  1 which Mrs. Montgomery Sears has hut recently pre- sented; a marvellous Persian carpet ol untold value, and last, but sure I v of equal interest v it h all these, certain sculptures   v Rodin, particu- larly a head of Ceres, which is one of his finest yviirl.s. 'I he hciorc-mentmncd head of " Aphrodite" is indeed verv beautiful. Mr. Henry James approves of it. Xo: that a liiu'ratt'ur is neces- sarily the Iie i judge of a piece of sculpture, hut it is inleresting to k low that lie thinks well of it. What may he more to the point is that many painters and sculptors admire the tiling particularly. It is, indeed, the sort of sculpture that especially interest  painters, because it is conceived in an alums  Kodinesque vein. Thai is, it is not so much modelled to render the actual shapes as lo sugge-l the appearaiue, the vision of a lovely and "rations woman. I'he Roman terr:.-colia head, on the oilier hand, is modi lied with the ulmosL verity of form. Lach shape one guesses lu be modelled almost exactly as it must have existed in rat lire. This creates adilterent sort of fascination, the fascinatii  n that a verv in terest ing thing gives rather than a very lovely thing. Still, this same interest is undeniable and the head is modi lied w ith such intensity as tDgivelhatpcculiar      ;r that all intense tilings have. Technically, il is hard to imagine a thing belter done, and even the miraculously   lever Trench modellers of modern times would, one feels, ' take off their he.is" to the unknown old Roman workman who made this craflsmanlike bit of work. The head of I lomer, a masterpiece, lias a quality in modelling something between the other two, if one may use the expression. Or rather, one might say that it was more charac- teristically classic than the other tyvo, more typical, avoiding the subtlety of the Aphrodite on the one hand and the intensity, on the oilier hand, of the realistic Roman terra cotta. Rodin's   Ceres  is, naturally, different from these others. Yet, if it has an affinity to any of them, it is to the Aphrodite. Both have the same quality of what one might call  veiled  or " muled " modelling. Rodin in some way has learned from draughtsmen and from painters a way of suggesting the appearance of nature in liis sculpture instead of giving the literal fact of the form, which, of course, would look dii erent in translucent marble than in ilesh.   In piis.um , one of the most charming things here is the lil lie Japanese garden which has been arranged in the Japanese section, charmingly ordered after the Japanese manner, with excel- lent taste in spacing and in balancing. There are little real red goldfish swimming about in real watery pools. The whole thing provides a pleasant divertiscment after some of the more grim and serious-looking rooms. There is a real bridge over tile real water, and water plants here or there, and potted plants but of a Jap- ancsqucncss  beyond. There is a stone lan- tern in the shape of a pagoda and stone lions   keeping guard near bv. Jn summing up the whole matter, one may say that the appearance of the new museum is, on the whole, most creditable; a little cold, a trifle cheerless, it may be  save in certain happy rooms like the Library, the Lawrence room, some of the Japanese apartments , yet that is natural enough in a new museum. Immense pains have been taken, certain npyv ideas have been worked out, and a result has been ai liieved not unworthy of the yvorkers. Philip L. Hale.

V E IPI   ER USER An average American knows many people. But he does not always know where they are. He has a thousand friends and ac- quaintances. Where are they at this particular moment  He can be sure of some of them perhaps a dozen. But he wants to locate one or more of the others. The Bell system enables him to reach them. If he finds his friend at home, or in his place of business, he talks with him at once. If he learns that his friend is in some other town the Bell System will furnish the connection. Cities are larger than they used to be. Men know and need to know more people. Yet the need of keeping in touch is as great as ever. Without Bell service there would be hopeless confusion. The range of the telephone is not confined to one town or one commun- ity. It is not satisfying simply to learn that a man is out of town ; through the Long Distance Service of the Bell Sys- tem he may be reached, wherever he is. The Bell Service extends to all com- munities. It reaches the millions of American people. One in twenty is a Bell subscriber. The other nineteen can be found bccause Bell service is universal service. The telephone does more work for less money than any other servant of mankind. There is economy as well as efficiency in one system, one policy, universal service. Every Bell Telephone is the Center of the System.

The finest tomatoes in the world grow right here in New Jersey almost at our doors.

They are pulled from the vines in the cool early morning when at their best; and brought directly to us. And within five hours they are made into _       T  . 1 omato We wash them in crystal-pure water piped from bed-rock. And we strain out not only the skin and seeds, but every vestige of the harsh eore-fibre that grows in all tomatoes. We use only the pure meaty part and clear juice with all their natural flavor. That is why Campbell s Tomato Soup is so rich and creamy, and has such a fresh spicy relish and aroma. No one not even you could make such soup without these gardens right at hand; without our costly apparatus: or without our priceless formula. Money will not produce better.

Your purchase of May hew Furnituj'e  or at least your desire for it is expected to follow your own in- vestigation of furniture realities. The May hew case is rested, finally, not upon Mayhew salesmanship or upon May hew advertising, good as we want these to be   but upon Mayhew Furniture the product of two generations of fidelity to definite ideals and specific standards in the design, manu- facture and marketing of furniture. See Mayhew Furniture at your Dealer's This Mark Identifies Mayhew Furniturg The Mayhew Name Some manufacturers  guarantee   their products vociferously. The mere name of other manufacturers is such an obvious guaranty of excellence in material, integrity in manufacture and straightforwardness in presentation, that the public accepts their product as a standard. Such a name in the mercantile world is more to be desired than much fine gold. It is such a name that two generations of Mayhews have sought to deserve by the simple method of putting genuine worth into May hew Furniture The name adds nothing to the furniture except convenience of identification, but the character of We furniture has made the name worth looking for. See Mayhew Furniture at your Dealer s This Mari Identifies Mayhew Furniturg The Mayhew Business h s been built from its foundation upon those ideals which have only begun to affect generally the structure of American busi- ness  ideals which generally are referred to as old-fashioned,  but which are quite new- fashioned in their practical application to the largest modern industries. Artistic Fidelity and Material Integrity are not abstractions in the building of May- hew furniture nor catchwords in Mayhew advertising. Mayhew Furniture is built to meet the cultured needs of an ever increasing public which demands and is willing to pay for furniture realities. See Mayhew Furniture at your Dealer's This Mari Identifies Mayhew Furniturg The Mayhew Method of presenting its lines for your inspection is as superior as Mayhew furniture. Leading dealers in the important American cities have examples of Mayhew furniture on their floors. They under- stand it and will show it to you intelligently. They have also the Mayhew Carbon Prints 11x14 inches in size   by which to show you the various styles they Ho not carry in stock. Every Mayhew dealer, therefore, is able to show you the entire Mayhew line of more than a thousand patterns representative examples on the floor, and supplementary pieces by photography It is a satis- fying way of securing the widest choice.

The success of the same interests in the Twin Falls Country, Idaho, is well known and a matter of record. Prompt Payment Guaranteed The prompt payment of both principal and interest on the bonds of this issue is unconditionally guar- anteed by ihe American Water Works and Guaran- tee Company, of Pittsburgh, Pa., capital and surplus $4,500,000. This company s net earnings exceed $600,000 annually. Il guarantees only the securities of properties it investigates and constructs with its own engineers, and controls and operates with its own organization. Since its organization, twenty-eight years ago. there has never been a single day s delay in the payment of either principal or interest on any bond it has guaran- teed. The strength of its guarantee continually increases as its business extends. With each new Issue the additional assets acquired by this constructing, operating and guaranteeing company are always greater than the contingent liability assumed. Investigation, Construction and Operation The most important requisite to a successful irri- gation enterprise is the constructing and operating experience which insures intelligent discrimination in the selection of properties, accurate engineering, care- ful construction and successful operation. The uni- form success of the American Water Works and Guar- antee Company in the selection, construction and operation of over forty water works properties and three irrigation projects in different parts of the I nited States, amply protects ihe investor in this issue of bonds.

Address Circulation Department, Scribner s Magazine, 153-157 Fifth Avenue, New York City Farm Land the Basis of Value In making investments the first consideration should always be the character of the security. Every investor to whom income is important should learn the facts about Irrigation bonds. I hey form, in our estimation, the safest way to earn 6 per cent. Secured by a Thousand Farms Irrigation bonds are secured by first liens on good farm land sometimes a thousand farms. The  anus are worth usually at least four times the loan. The farms are exceedingly fertile, and arc no  subject co crap failures. Any one season's earnings are generally sufficient to repay the whole loan. The bonds are additionally secured by a first mortgage on an irrigation system, in which the investment is ofu n twice the bond issue. Some Irrigation bonds are municipal securities, which form- as du School bonds a tax lien on the district. Some arc issued under the " Carey Act." where the State supervises the project. They are issued in denominations of $roo. $500 and ift.000. so one may invest eitlier little or much AH are serial bonds, part of which arc paid annually, so one may make long-time or short-time investments. 78 Issues Sold Tn the pas  16 years we have sold 78 separate issues of Reclamation Imnds, all based On farm liens. Not a dollar of loss has resulted to any investor. Our dominant place now gives us the pick of these projects. They are passed 011 by our own engineers and attorneys.

This new drive entirely eliminates all chain troubles and puts the Baker so far in advance of all other electrics that comparison is no longer possible. The public s appreciation of Baker quality and mechanical efficiency is shown by the fact that the demand for Baker Electrics exceeds the demand for all other electrics combined.

Charm is that harmonious ex- cellence which wins w i t 'uni t argument. To the car owner who feels its influence, it has a rai nr In yond price, and ho would not trade that cai  for any other car in the wide, wide world. Charm is progressive. Original- ly we were charmed by the sen- sation of riding in a vehicle that propelled itself. But as experience broadens, and we come to realize that cars differ, we learn that our first car has, after all, a list of imper- fections. Then our lirst charm gives way to the charm of some other car that not only propels itself, as the first did, but does so in a manner infinitely beth r. Thus from car to car, model lo model, year to yeai, ti e old charm goes ami n mn .l.unn takes its pi in. Since the n otor ear is but :i ma- chine that tlnderyiics annual irii- proveinent, il would serin pos- sible to improve it less and less each succeeding year thus ai- liually lessening the degree i f flesh eliarni to be experienced by tin  1','ir owner. I'ortunateI , however, this is iii t always 111   condition. Indeei , the Wt xt I'eeinl   m ftrm I WCht supplies charm in quantity an 1 quality hevaiid the greatest es- pectation.

THE HARTFORD FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY lias rouncJed out a century of business history. That means something in the hazardous business of lire insurance, l  r four out ol every five companies organized in this country have either lailed or retired. Il means unshaken stability. The smoke ol every great American conflagration has darkened the sky over the Hartford s head. In San Francisco alone it paid ten millions. But emerging triumphant from the ordeals ol I 00 years, it enters its second century stronger than ever. Unshaken stability lor a century is no mean heritage, but age is venerable only when adorned with honor. Honor implies more than honesty. It is the quality which impels an institution to meet every obligation, not only with promptness and exactness, but with fairness and a spirit of equity. 1 hat is  he Hartford s record in the past, its aim to-dav and its ideal for the future. 1 ts policies afford unsurpassed indemnity, and by co- operating with its patrons to lessen fire dangers, it offers continuous service. Its business, scattered among more than 1 5,000 communities throughout this great land, is the largest ol any fire insurance company in America. Its agents are everywhere.

It will prove of invaluable assistance in Ihe planning of your bathroom. Many model rooms are illustrated. This valuable 100-page book is sent for six ccnfs postage. The cost of a good bathtub is insignificant when com- pared with its health and comfort value to the home. Its first cost should be its last. You should plan that your children and your children's children will enjoy the bathroom equipment you install this year, in as good and serviceable condition as the day you put it in. There is practically little difference in cost between a ball tub properly made and the undependable, unre- liable kind   between the  Standard Guaranteed bathtub that's built to last, to retain its smooth, cleanly surface, and the tub made of inferior material, which may look well when first bought but when once in- stalled, is not dependable. There is but one way only to make certain that your bathroom equipment is all that it ought to be. And that is   look for the  Standard  Guarantee label. Assure yourself that it is on the bathtub you buy. The Standard  Sai itarg Co.   New York : 35-37 W. 3.1st St. f Toronto, Can.: 59 Richmond Sc. E.
