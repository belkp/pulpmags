AUGUST 1913  A WOMAN AT DUSK  NE white hand droops across your knee you  stare Off into space with shadowy eyes that seem To watch a lone horizon dark with rain And cities ruinous and seas forlorn  Of sun and movement  Like a dead leaf stirs That listless hand and then grows still again And round your chin the soft and child like chin As delicate as dew a ghostly sigh Hovers and then is gone  Serene and broad Your white brow is beneath its banded hair Serene the bosom that so softly breathes Serene the milk white throat that moves no more Than marble moves the gently hollowed cheek Serene too seems the body grown so still And drooping like a wing out wearied by Too many homing seas   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Ah calm it seems But at some mystic core a mystic fire Still burns the ruby tumult of the blood Still leaves it perilous still played upon By ghostly fingers from forgotten tombs Serene you seem to wait yet round your eyes So blue with weariness a trouble lurks Behind the honeyed corners of your mouth Left tremulous with passion wakes and stirs A protest Close about the parted lips Rose red and woman weak and warm Broods something over tense a wistfulness That has not been appeased a hidden note Of hunger that has gone unsatisfied A question tragical a startled cry Unanswered and a thought that cannot sleep Out of the gloom I see your white face yearn As silence yearns for music or the sea For morning waits A mirrored wonderment A far off glory from you flashes and shines And then is gone as in a casement burns The sunset gold And still you scarcely move And speak no word and passive droop the hands That in their listless movements stirred so like A little child s and all the weariness Of all the world seems weighing on your soul Out of the ages gaze your brooding eyes And barrier gulfs of time between us drift   A Woman at Dusk  And shadow like you face the shadowy night Above earth s sleeping hills and converse hold With hidden things  And I watch desolate Beside you I who but an hour ago Seemed one with you in flesh and spirit I Must sit alone and lonely see you mourn And feel again still close some iron door Between your soul and mine For still you wait Half wearily content with discontent Still idle with unrest you idly watch Calm with a fever that o er fiercely burns And saddened with a joy too keen to endure You stare off into space and say no word But from those unassuaged and shadowy lips I catch some echo of the timeless quest I hear your spirit s whisper that all life Is nothing that from sleep to sleep we move And know not where we go that through the dark Your groping hands seek something not of mist And moonlight that amid the endless cold You crave some keen and momentary warmth Some glory more than earthly glory ask The wine that reddens ocean foam where far To straining eyes the darkling waters reach The wine that Twilight drinks from paling rose And leaf the wine that tender April pours Across the morning world the selfsame wine   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  That sends October singing down the hills And wakens in the sunburnt breast of youth The wonder and the lyric ache of love For life s last gift of rapture you cry out And will not be denied for one great flash Of splendor through earth s glooms inglorious Lone as a lute your pleading voice invokes Companionship your luring body calls For secret consummations for the kiss Enkindling and the tangled joy and grief Of having given much You question not Time s course uncomprehended Childishly You yield yourself and in return demand Only that you be taken On the winds Of fire you make a bed wherein to rest Humbled and helpless on man s will you wait The appointed vessel and the lamp ordained The hour predestined and the dream fulfilled As women give you give accepting naught But your own bosom s grim necessity Of being crushed Across the ghostly years Where nothing may endure beyond the grave You cry that love must last you grow content With soft capitulation Yet your hour Of wayward triumph knows the chill of tombs Your dusky lidded eyes are dark with tears Your softest words are saddened with the knell Your own sad heart makes vocal   A Woman at Dusk  Then you cling To me and ask if Death could vanquish love And cry that I must keep you for all time But pitiful it seems for as you speak The shadow falls the rapture melts away The light upon the darkling sea line fails And soft as mist between your soul and mine The solemn wonder widens So you sit In astral silence watching still for that Which never comes In utter weariness You wait with that last emptiness of soul Which leaves you shadowy eyed and bowed with grief Yet veiled in wayward beauty creeping back And crowning you with wonder  Mystical You suddenly become and mystical The thrice sealed message and the woman thirst That draws you passive to the shores of pain That flings you broken from the seas of dream And in surrender causes you to reap Enriched your body grows with ichors strange And of the gods you seem and infinite You are because of infinite desires A something to be sought of land and sea And sheltered tenderly and sorrowed for And made the bearer of the final cruse For desolate my soul cries out again And all your body with its crown of grief POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Wakes with an answering cry and as you sit With one white hand across your huddled knees My lips seek out your lips of mortal rose And tremulous you yield and from the pain Of utter sacrifice still garner joy Then burns the flame anew then glows once more The momentary splendor then the tide Sings back into its sea and then the rose Is full and all the throats of song are soft But soon the voices fail and soon we know How keenly fugitive the glimpse how close The shadow is how bitter sweet the end And being mortal how our mortal love Only on winds of fire may find relief And from the rise and fall of passion s tides Still catch at some forlorn tranquillity  Arthur Stringer   ELLIS PARK  Little park that I pass through I carry off a piece of you Every morning hurrying down To my work day in the town Carry you for country there To make the city ways more fair I take your trees And your breeze Your greenness Your cleanness Some of your shade some of your sky Some of your calm as I go by Your flowers to trim The pavements grim Your space for room in the jostled street And grass for carpet to my feet Your fountains take and sweet bird calls To sing me from my office walls All that I can see I carry off with me But you never miss my theft So much treasure you have left As I find you fresh at morning So I find you home returning Nothing lacking from your grace All your riches wait in place   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  For me to borrow  On the morrow  Do you hear this praise of you  Little park that I pass through  Helen Hoyt  TREES  I think that I shall never see  A poem lovely as a tree  A tree whose hungry mouth is prest Against the earth s sweet flowing breast  A tree that looks at God all day And lifts her leafy arms to pray  A tree that may in Summer wear A nest of robins in her hair  Upon whose bosom snow has lain Who intimately lives with rain  Poems are made by fools like me But only God can make a tree  Joyce Kilmer    O DRIMIN DHU DEELISH  O Drimin Dhu Deelish my kind Kerry cow As black as the night with one star on her brow For Drimin Dhu Deelish the silk of the kine For Drimin Dhu Deelish I mourn and I pine  As O ru Drimin Dhu och oru agraw As O TU Drimin Dhu go dhu tu slaun  For when to the milking I d call Drimin Dhu Twas then like a deer down the mountain she flew And ah when beneath her the stool I would place How oft on my shoulder she rubbed her soft face  As O ru Drimin Dhu och oru agraw As O ru Drimin Dhu go dhu tu slaun  And though sixteen gallon from Drimin would hail And under my fingers froth up in the pail She ne er kicked one keeler away o er the green For no cow genteeler than Drimin was seen  As O ru Drimin Dhu och oru agraw As O ru Drimin Dhu go dhu tu slaun  The mountain bog slid and surprised Drimin Dhu Though bravely she battled to break her way through Till down down she went with a drizzen and drone Poor Drimin Dhu Deelish and left us alone  As O ru Drimin Dhu och oru agraw As O TU Drimin Dhu go dhu to slaun   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  When other cows ailed in the wet and the cold Our Drimin was evermore hearty and bold Straight back and firm body and honey sweet breath Mild eyes and grave manners how could you know  death  As O ru Drimin Dhu och oru agraw As O ru Drimin Dhu go dhu tu slaunl  0 silk of the kine when amongst us you stood No milk was as fine and no butter as good But oh tis chill water and oh tis dry scone Since Drimin since Drimin Dhu Deelish is gone  As O ru Drimin Dhu och oru agraw As O ru Drimin Dhu go dhu tu slaun  THE SEA SINGER  The heaven was star strewn Above the new moon  Before a faint breeze we were floating When out of the distance still clearer and clearer And nearer and nearer there sighed  And there cried A strange lonesome song o er the tide  We stood still and grave To watch a far wave That gathered and gathered toward us   The Sea Singer  Till laughing aboard us there leaped from the billow With locks long and yellow a Maid The Sea Maid Whose song on our heart strings had played  Sweet pain pleasure sharp She poured from her harp  Around her we listened in wonder The wave warbled under the stars in heaven s hollow They all seemed to follow her song  Her lone song As idly we fleeted along  To leave us she turned Then rashly we burned  To keep her bright beauty before us But when to enring her we strove the Sea Singer She wove her white finger around  And around And left us all standing spell bound  Alfred Perceval Graves   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  TRIUMPH OF THE SINGER  I shake my hair in the wind of morning For the joy within me that knows no bounds I echo backward the vibrant beauty Wherewith heaven s hollow lute resounds  I shed my song on the feet of all men On the feet of all shed out like wine On the whole and the hurt I shed my bounty The beauty within me that is not mine  Turn not away from my song nor scorn me Who bear the secret that holds the sky And the stars together but know within me There speaks another more wise than I  Nor spurn me here from your heart to hate me Yet hate me here if you will Not so Myself you hate but the Love within me That loves you whether you would or no  Here Love returns with love to the lover And Beauty unto the heart thereof And Hatred unto the heart of the hater Whether he would or no with love THE THUNDER SHOWER  The lightning flashed and lifted The lids of heaven apart The fiery thunder rolled you All night long through my heart  From dreams of you at dawn I rose to the window ledge The storm had passed away The lake lapped on the sedge  The lyre of heaven trembled Still with the thought of you The twilight on the waters And all my spirit too  SONG  All my love for my sweet I bared one day to her Carelessly she took it And like a conqueror She bowed the neck of my soul To fit it to her yoke And bridled the lips of Song Fear within me awoke   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  But Love cried Swiftly swiftly Bear her along the road Beautiful is the goal And Beauty is the goad  John Hall Wheelock  I HEARD A FLUTE  I heard a flute that sang unto the dawn  The dawn dove grey  Until it flushed to swift desire the wan White heart of day  Until it brimmed the virgin breasted hills With golden fire And sang through all the azure veined rills Love s wild desire  O child heart of the Dawn who lay so mute On Night s dark breast 1 saw you quicken to the shepherd flute Of love s unrest  I saw you ravished from your skyey sphere Fleet foot you ran Down dryad paths you followed clear The Flute of Pan  Ruth Gaines    TERESINA S FACE  He saw it last of all before they herded in the steerage Dark against the sunset where he lingered by the hold The tear stained dusk rose face of her the little Teresina Sailing out to lands of gold  Ah the days were long long days still toiling in the vineyard Working for the coins that set him free to go to her Where gay it glowed the flower face of little Teresina Where the joy and riches were  Hard to find one rose face where the dark rose faces cluster Where the outland laws are strange and outland voices hum Only one lad s hoping and the word of Teresina Who would wait for him to come  God grant he may not find her since he might not win her freedom Nor yet be great enough to love in such marred captive wise The patient painted face of her the little Teresina With its cowed all knowing eyes  Margaret Widdemer   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  GLOIRE  Il avait su gagner à lui Beaucoup d hommes ensemble Avec un cri qu ils aimaient tous entendre Avec un haut fait dont ils se parlaient  Il y avait un morceau du monde Où l on connaissait sa vie Ses actes et son visage  Il se dressait devant la foule Et connaissait l enivrement De la sentir soumise à sa parole Comme les blés le sont au vent  Il la faisait se recueillir Il la rendait chaude et heureuse Il la faisait hurler et rire Ou haleter soudain  Et son bonheur était de croire Quand il avait quitté la foule Que chacun des hommes l aimait Et que sa présence durait Innombrable et puissant en eux Comme en des braises dispersées Les dons et la marque du feu   Gloire  Or un jour il en suivit un Qui retournait chez soi tout seul Et il vit son regard s éteindre Dès qu il fut un peu loin des autres  Une autre fois il reconnut l un d eux L un de ceux qui l avaient aimé Avec le cri de toute leur face Avec l élan de tout leur corps Debout devant lui tout un soir Il s approcha il lui parla L homme connaissait bien son nom Mais n avait rien gardé de lui Dans son esprit ni dans son coeur  Et même il vit une foule Une foule comme les siennes Qui se pressait ivre et séduite Autour d un autre Habile à faire des grimaces  Alors il connut qu il avait conquis trop Et trop peu   Que pour faire une âme de foule Chaque homme ne prête un instant Que la surface de son âme  Il avait régné sur un peuple Mais comme un reflet sur de l eau   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Mais comme une flamme d alcool Qui ne sait pas ou s attacher Et qui brûle ce qu elle frôle Sans le réchauffer  Et c est alors qu il s appliqua comme à vivre À connaître le plus d êtres qu il put À les connaître lentement et un a un En demeurant et devisant avec chacun Quand ils étaient bien eux quand ils étaient bien seuls  Son secret fut de posséder Quelque chose avec chacun d eux Quelqu humble trésor qui leur fût bien cher  Son bonheur fut de posseder En commun avec chacun d eux Le souvenir secret d un seul instant Mais d un instant élargi d une telle joie Qu ils en pouvaient vivre bien des soirs  Et tous ceux qu ils connut ainsi Conservèrent tout isolée En leur pudeur Certaine image d eux memes Où ils aimaient se reconnaître Et qu ils ne pouvaient regarder Sans retrouver ses traits parmi les leurs  Charles Vildrac   POEMS IN PROSE AND VERSE  A SEQUENCE  I INVOCATION 0 Pearl in the Lotus O Krishna of the Jade Flute O Christ upon the Triple Cross Hear me I pray you And give heed to my prayer For faintly  And in my sleep I have heard distant singing  II THE EAGLE  For an hundred years I have soared Under the sky Grayed is my breast by the storms Round distant peaks Still gaze my golden eyes Fiercely at the sun  III PRELUDE  Beloved if you would but gaze Into those dark pools Tis your own face you will see   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Your face and the far off hills That you might have seen long since By the turning of your head  IV ENIGMA  There is dust upon your feet Dust and blood And upon your hands there is blood And with dust and sweat Matted is your hair Dark are your eyes and empty Like the lost pools in that garden Which is unremembered of God  V THE MOUNTAINS  The mountains Were sunk in the sea But now they are risen High and more high I will climb my mountains I will rest in their winds At night I will descend Wearied to the valleys In the warmth of my valleys I will sleep till the dawn   Poems in Prose and Verse  NOCTURNE IN PASTELS  One face I saw shining from a sea of faces as the brightness of a star shines from beneath dead water One face only did I see and the soul that looked from her eyes was veiled as with a dark veil  Like a strange bird in an old snare like a strange fish in an old net so my heart snared her beauty and holds it She was like the shadow of a plum blossom on a stagnant pool like a dying pearl in the depths of the sea like the lonely singer who sings forever beneath one casement  Therefore in praise of her I touch fire to delicate incense to incense in a bowl of bronze graven with the shadow of an ancient love The smoke of it coils upward and my thoughts of her live in its coiling shadows hers their fragrance and the unreality As perfumes hover about the garments of the dead so clings her fragrance to my cloak of dreams as the memory of last year s plum blossom lives like a dream so clings unreality to the hem of my cloak  I wait beneath the window of my Beloved and the window is opened to me I wait beneath the window of my Beloved and it remains closed I stand in a cloudy night asking the moon to smile I am one who flashed upon by a pale gleaming face a pale star buried under dead water seeks and waits and watches beneath a darkened sun   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  NOCTURNE TRISTE  The iridescence of sunrise over the ocean gleams on the wings of a fly and on the cheeks of a girl blooms the delicate flush of a peach but the fly hovers above the refuse of the world and at the heart of the peach gnaws a worm  The night wind is cold like the fingers of death the sky purple like a cup of Tyrian poison the gleam of the moon white like the flesh of a leper and the sea dark like the wings of a bat  My Beloved looks at me and her eyes are hard and cold her slender fingers cold and limp and her parted lips turning from mine bring forth no word  NOCTURNES  I Thy feet That are like little silver birds Thou hast set upon pleasant ways Therefore I will follow thee Thou Dove o the Golden Eyes Upon any path will I follow thee For the light of thy beauty Shines before me like a torch   Poems in Prose and Verse  II  Thy feet are white Upon the foam of the sea Hold me fast thou bright Swan Lest I stumble And into deep waters  III  Long have I been the Singer beneath  thy Casement And now I am weary I am sick with longing O my Beloved Therefore bear me with thee Swiftly upon Upon our road  IV  With the net of thy hair Thou hast fished in the sea And a strange fish Hast thou caught in thy net For thy hair Beloved Holdeth my heart Within its web of gold   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  v  I am weary with love and thy lips Are as night born poppies Give me therefore thy lips That I may know sleep  VI  I am weary with longing I am faint with love For upon my head the moonlight Has fallen As a sword  Skipwith Cannell  COMMENTS AND REVIEWS IMPRESSIONISM SOME SPECULATIONS  WITH regard to the actual production of  verse to the making of its form or even the  evolutions of its rhythms who would dare be  exact But with prose that conscious and  workable medium it is a very different matter One finds a subject somewhere immediately the mind gets to work upon the form blocks out patches of matter of dialogue of description  If the function of the subject be to grow into a short story one will start with a short sharp definite sentence so as to set the pace Mr Lamotte one will write returned from fishing His eyes were red the ends of his collar pressed open because he had hung down his head in the depth of his reflection   Or if it is to be a long short story we shall qualify the sharpness of the opening sentence and damp it down as thus When on a late afternoon of July Mr Lamotte walked up from the river with his rod in his hand   Or again if the subject seems one for a novel we begin Mr Lamotte had resided at the Brown House for sixteen years The property consisted of six hundred and twenty acres of which one hundred and forty were park land intersected by the river Torridge and so on We shall proceed to get in Mr Lamotte and his property and his ancestry and his landscape and his society   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  We shall think about these things for a long time and with an absolute certainty of aim we shall know what we want to do and to the measure of the light vouchsafed we shall do it  But with verse I just do not know I do not know anything at all As far as I am concerned it just comes I hear in my head a vague rhythm I know that I would very willingly cut off my right hand to have written the Wallfahrt nach Kevelaer of Heine or Im Moos by Annette von Dreste I would give almost anything to have written almost any modern German lyric or some of the ballads of my friend Levin Schucking These fellows you know they sit at their high windows in German lodgings they lean out it is raining steadily Opposite them is a shop where herring salad onions and oranges are sold A woman with a red petticoat and a black and grey check shawl goes into the shop and buys three onions four oranges and half a kilo of herring salad And there is a poem Hang it all there is a poem  But this is England this is Campden Hill and we have a literary jargon in which we must write We must write in it or every word will swear  Denn nach Koln am Rheine Geht die Procession   For the procession is going to Cologne on the Rhine You could not use the word procession in an English poem It would not be literary Yet when those lines   Impressionism Some Speculations  are recited in Germany people weep over them I have seen fat Frankfurt bankers weeping when the Wallfahrt was recited in a red plush theatre with gilt cherubs all over the place  I may really say that for a quarter of a century I have kept before me one unflinching aim to register my own times in terms of my own time and still more to urge those who are better poets and better prose writers than myself to have the same aim I suppose I have been pretty well ignored I find no signs of my being taken seriously It is certain that my conviction would gain immensely as soon as another soul could be found to share it But for a man mad about writing this is a solitary world and writing you cannot write about writing without using foreign words is a métier de chien  It is somewhat a matter of diction In France upon the whole a poet and even a quite literary poet can write in a language that roughly speaking any hatter can use In Germany the poet writes exactly as he speaks And these facts do so much towards influencing the poet s mind If we cannot use the word procession we are apt to be precluded from thinking about processions Now processions to use no other example are very interesting and suggestive things and things that are very much part of the gnat dance that modern life is Because if a people has sufficient interest in public matters to join in huge processions it has reached a certain stage of folk consciousness If it will not or cannot   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  do these things it is in yet other stages Heine s procession was for instance not what we should call a procession at all With us there are definite types there is the king s procession at Ascot there are processions in support of women s suffrage or against it those in support of Welsh disestablishment or against it But the procession of Koln was a pilgrimage   Organized state functions popular expressions of desire are one symptom pilgrimage another but the poet who ignores them all three is to my thinking lost since in one way or another they embrace the whole of humanity and are mysterious hazy and tangible A poet of a sardonic turn of mind will find sport in describing how in a low pot house an emissary of a skilful government will bribe thirty ruffians at five shillings a head to break up and so discredit a procession in favor of votes for women yet another poet may describe how a lady in an omnibus with a certain turn for rhetoric will persuade the greater number of the other passengers to promise to join the procession for the saving of a church another will become emotionalised at the sight of the Sword of Mercy borne by a peer after the Cap of Maintenance borne by yet another And believe me to be perfectly sincere when I say that a poetry whose day cannot find poets for all these things is a poetry that is lacking in some of its members  So at least I see it Modern life is so extraordinary so hazy so tenuous with still such definite and concrete   Impressionism Some Speculations  spots in it that I am forever on the look out for some poet who shall render it with all its values I do not think that there was ever as the saying is such a chance for a poet I am breathless I am agitated at the thought of having it to begin upon And yet I am aware that I can do nothing since with me the writing of verse is not a conscious art It is the expression of an emotion and I can so often not put my emotions into any verse  I should say to put a personal confession on record that the very strongest emotion at any rate of this class that I have ever had was when I first went to the Shepherd s Bush Exhibition and came out on a great square of white buildings all outlined with lights There was such a lot of light and I think that what I hope for in Heaven is an infinite clear radiance of pure light There were crowds and crowds of people or no there was spread out beneath the lights an infinite moving mass of black with white faces turned up to the light moving slowly quickly not moving at all being obscured reappearing  I know that the immediate reflection will come to almost any reader that this is nonsense or an affectation How he will say is any emotion to be roused by the mere first night of a Shepherd s Bush exhibition Poetry is written about love about country lanes about the singing of birds I think it is not not now a days We are too far from these things What we are in that which is all around us is the Crowd the Crowd blindly looking for joy or for that most pathetic   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  of all things the good time I think that that is whyfelt so profound an emotion on that occasion It must have been the feeling not the thought of all these good kind nice people this immense Crowd suddenly let loose upon a sort of Tom Tiddler s ground to pick up the glittering splinters of glass that are Romance hesitant but certain of vistas of adventure if no more than the adventures of their own souls like cattle in a herd suddenly let into a very rich field and hesitant before the enamel of daisies the long herbage the rushes fringing the stream at the end  I think pathos and poetry are to be found beneath those lights and in those sounds in the larking of the anaemic girls in the shoulders of the women in evening dress in the idealism of a pickpocket slanting through a shadow and imagining himself a hero whose end will be wealth and permanent apartments in the Savoy Hotel For such dreamers of dreams there are  That indeed appears to me and I am writing as seriously as I can the real stuff of the poetry of our day Love in country lanes the song of birds moonlight  these the poet playing for safety and the critic trying to find something safe to praise will deem the sure cards of the poetic pack They seem the safe things to sentimentalise over and it is taken for granted that sentimentalising is the business of poetry It is not of course Upon the face of it the comfrey under the hedge may seem a safer card to play for the purposes of poetry than the   Impressionism Some Speculations  portable zinc dustbin left at dawn for the dustman to take  But it is not really for the business of poetry is not sentimentalism so much as the putting of certain realities in certain aspects The comfrey under the hedge judged by these standards is just a plant but the ash bucket at dawn is a symbol of poor humanity of its aspirations its romance its ageing and its death The ashes represent the sociable fires the god of the hearth of the slumbering dawn populations the orange peels with their bright colors represent all that is left of a little party of the night before when an alliance between families may have failed to be cemented or being accomplished may prove a disillusionment or a temporary paradise The empty tin of infant s food stands for birth the torn scrap of a doctor s prescription for death Yes even if you wish to sentimentalise the dustbin is a much safer card to play than the comfrey plant And similarly the anaemic shop girl at the exhibition with her bad teeth and her cheap black frock is safer than Isolde  She is more down to the ground and much more touching  Or again there are the symbols of the great fine things that remain to us Many of us might confess to being unable to pass Buckingham Palace when the Royal Standard is flying on the flagstaff without a very recognizable emotion equivalent to the journalist s phrase a catching at the throat For there are symbols of aspiration everywhere The preposterous white   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  papier maché fountain is a symbol so are the preposterous gilded gates so are the geraniums and the purplish grey pencil of Westminster Cathedral tower that overhangs the palace There are upon the standard three leopards passant which are ancient and suggestive things there is the lion rampant which is pretentious and a harp which is a silly sort of thing to have upon a flag But it is rich spot a patch of colour that is left to us As the ugly marquis said of the handsome footman Mon dieu comme nous les faisons et comme ils nous font  For papier maché and passant leopards and all these symbols are what the Crowd desires and what they stand for made the Crowd what it is And the absurd beloved traditions continue The excellent father of a family in jack boots white breeches sword helmet strap gauntlets views the preparation of his accoutrements and the flag that he carries before his regiment as something as much a part of his sacred profession as to a good butler is the family plate That is an odd mysterious human thing the stuff for poetry  We might confess again to having had emotions at the time of the beginning of the South African war we were say in the gallery at Drury Lane and the audience were all on fire We might confess to having had emotions in the Tivoli Music Hall when just after a low comedian had taken off Henry VIII it was announced that Edward VII was dying and the whole audience stood up and sang God Save the King as a genuine   Impressionism Some Speculations  hymn that time We may have had similar emotions at seeing the little Prince of Wales standing unsteadily on a blue foot stool at the coronation a young boy in his Garter robes or at a Secret Consistory at the Vatican when the Holy Father ceremonially whispered to one Cardinal or another   War like emotions tears at the passing of a sovereign being touched at the sight of a young prince or a sovereignly pontifical prisoner of the Vatican this is perhaps the merest digging out of fossils from the bed of soft clay that the Crowd is God knows we may just despise democracy or the writing of Laureate s odes but the putting of the one thing in juxtaposition with the other that seems to me to be much more the business of the poet of today than setting down on paper what he thinks about the fate of Brangaene not because any particular lesson may be learned but because such juxtapositions suggest emotions  For myself I have been unable to do it I am too old perhaps or was born too late anything you like But there it is I would rather read a picture in verse of the emotions and environment of a Googe Street anarchist than recapture what songs the syrens sang That after all was what François Villon was doing for the life of his day and I should feel that our day was doing its duty by posterity much more surely if it were doing something of the sort   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  Can it then be done In prose of course it can But in poetry Is there something about the mere framing of verse the mere sound of it in the ear that it must at once throw its practitioner or its devotee into an artificial frame of mind Verse presumably quickens the perceptions of its writer as does hashish or ether But must it necessarily quicken them to the perception only of the sentimental the false the hackneyed aspects of life Must it make us because we live in cities babble incessantly of green fields or because we live in the twentieth century must we deem nothing poetically good that did not take place before the year 1603  This is not saying that one should not soak oneself with the Greek traditions study every fragment of Sappho delve ages long in the works of Bertran de Born translate for years like the minnelieder of Walther von der Vogelweide or that we should forget the bardic chants of Patric of the Seven Kingdoms Let us do anything in the world that will widen our perceptions We are the heirs of all the ages But in the end I feel fairly assured that the purpose of all these pleasant travails is the right appreciation of such facets of our own day as God will let us perceive  I remember seeing in a house in Hertford an American cartoon representing a dog pursuing a cat out of the door of a particularly hideous tenement house and beneath this picture was inscribed the words This is life one damn thing after another Now I think it would be   Impressionism Some Speculations  better to be able to put that sentiment into lyric verse than to remake a ballad of the sorrows of Cuchulain or to paraphrase the Book of Job I do not mean to say that Job is not picturesque I do not mean to say that it is not a good thing to have the Book of the Seven Sorrows of whom you will in the background of your mind or even coloring your outlook But it is better to see Life in terms of one damn thing after another vulgar as is the phraseology or even the attitude than to render it in terms of withering gourds and other poetic paraphernalia It is in fact better to be vulgar than affected at any rate if you practice poetry  Ford Madox Hueffer  Odes et Prières par Jules Romains Mercure de France  Paris  Monsieur Romains is one of the most interesting of  Parisian poets well acclaimed The Mouvement Unani  miste it is Romains The movement would seem to be  primarily philosophic or as Romains himself proclaims  it religious It is the adoration of the group unit or  something of that sort The Japanese state religion is  perhaps its closest prototype but these good orientals  do not allow this to infect their art If it be permitted a  foreigner to decry what the French have themselves  accepted I should say with all respect that the poetry  actually produced by the Unanimistes has at least one  blemish from the point of view of the craftsman As a   POETRY A Magazine of Verse  philosophic movement it may affect the bases of aesthetics it is a manifestation of unquestionable energy and it therefore concerns us who are concerned with the art but Romains much lauded Ode to the Crowd here Present is rhetoric it is very fine and intoxicating rhetoric no doubt but as poetry it harks back to the pre Victorian era when Shelley set out to propagandize the world It is of the time of Leopardi If Romains had lived earlier he would have written Night thoughts on Death and Immortality or on The Grave now a days the craze is for social theory or crowd psychology This work is symptomatic It is post Whitman with a vengeance  It is the same with Verhaeren s City It is good rhetoric very good If we had found the passage in a prose work we should have thought it rather fine Perhaps it gains a little by being in verse I am not sure but it is not to be confused with true Helicon It belongs to that sort of imaginative reason wherefrom William Blake was divinely sent to deliver us Verhaeren is not so much Whitman as a sort of lesser Wordsworth with a sense of Flamand country and of people of labour In Les Pauvres he is as far above our objections or our praise as is Wordsworth at his best from the usual charge of dulness  As for Romains we state against him that the art is too high a thing to be hitched to any single propaganda however noble and even this objection might be narrowed to almost a quibble Romains is a man with his work   Romains  before him and he will have little care and no need whatever of caring for either praise or stricture As for his language strict chaste severe we join the little weight of our praise to that of the intelligent critic M Georges Duhamel and give thanks for Romains and his vigorous production  If this review seem lacking in due warmth it is only that I speak of a man in the mid flow of acclamation an acclamation which seems to me at times a little heedless of the possible dangers being courted by its object  Ezra Pound  NOTES  Of the poets represented in this number all are American except Mr Graves and Monsieur Vildrac Mr Graves who was
