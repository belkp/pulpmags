The articles already published have met every expectation with regard to their exceptional interest and value, and the extraordinarily large editions required to meet the demand have had to be in- creased with each number. Nothing he has ever written has better revealed his own attractive personality, his remarkable faculty for observation and appreciation of the picturesque and unusual in both humanity and nature. The Boston Transcript says:  Mr. Roosevelt has a unique way of feeling as the American nation feels. His general sympathies, modes of thought and emphasis, and even his prejudices are largely theirs. That fact makes Americans follow with zest the story of his hunting in the wilds, told with the same grim strength that has made his political utterances so far-reaching and deep in their influences." These articles are not only fascinating narratives of adventure, they are also authoritative accounts of the natural history of many animals but little known to most readers, and illuminative and most valuable commentaries upon the people, civilization, and possibilities of future development in East Africa. The illustrations from photo- graphs by Kermit Roosevelt and other members of the expedition are especially interesting. The October number, containing the first of Mr. Roosevelt s articles, Was completely exhausted, but a special reprint has been made which will be sent free with all subscriptions beginning with November.

This story possesses all of his fascinating qualities of poetry and romance and the interest of character revelation, together with a strikingly original point of view that will attract and hold the attention from the very beginning. It is a modern story, a view of life as the author sees it to-day, and its truth, beauty of style and fearlessness, with a characteristic note of unconventionality and humanness, will make it one of the most remarkable serials the Magazine has ever published.

Success in school advertising depends on the recognition of well-established principles. Simple as these principles are. their observance is abso- lutely necessary to satisfactory publicity. Appropriate  i certain amount of money lor ad vert ising. Figure this expenditure as you figure the salaiy of your best teacher  a service you cannot do without. Plan your campaign. Make it adequate. Select your mediums with infinite care. Know why every publication you use holds a place on your list, and see that every inquiry from your advertising is ll l itW ol up. Make your copy comprehensive plain and definite. Make it lit your school. Let it be characteristic ol you anil your institu- tion. Use some copy though it be small every month in the year. Talk in biggest space when there are most listening, and so more talking in June. July and August but talk all the time. People do not choose a school in a day. The fact that t he i r ch i 1  1 re n will need one is present from the first, and thoughtful parents take time to decide such matters. The most successful schools of to-day began to advertise in Scribner s Magazine years ago for pupils for to-day to-day these same schools are advertising for to-morrow. The extent of SCRIBNER S circulation   The character of SCRIBNER'S readers   The cost of SCRIBNER S service  make SCRIBNERS MAGAZINE of first importance in school advertising. Especially in 1910. SCRIBNER'S c rou af on fins doubted in the past six months   Yet the advertising rates practically the same : page page page page inch inch for schools remain $200.00 100.00 50.00 25.00 17.50 8.75 Smallest space accepted   l - inch, on time insertions.

There are untold forests in the States of Oregon and Washington, enough in one State alone, at the present rale of culling, to last one hundred and twenty years. The commercial value of these Inrests is almost incalculable. Scenically herein these two Northern Coast Slates lies the  real Switzerland of  mer- ica.  The article is illustrated very rii lily from photographs. The historian of the future who at- tempts the story of the great West, the passing of the red man and the cowboy, tin  work of our sol- diers among the In- dians, will find much of his work already done for him in the drawings and paint ings of Frederii Remington. They tell graphically and convincingly of scenes and episodes in the picturesque life of the great West. Remington knows it from actual con tart, as he has found his material in camp and on the trail. He has lor a number of years devoted most of his time to painting in oil subjects in his chosen field. In the February numbera very notable and artistically important group of these paintings will be reproduced, accompanied by an article by Royal Cortissoz. Remington models in clay also, and a number of his small pieces in bronze, admirably spirited and truthful delineations of men and horses in action, have been purchased bv the Metropolitan Museum of Art. V  V  The fact that the    ctober number, containing the lirst of the Roosevelt articles, was sold com- pletely out within a day or two after publica- tion, and that a second edition of November was called lor within two days, is sufficient evi- dence of his wide popularity, as well as a tribute lo ihe interest ol the articles themselves. From a purely business point of view, il is a most significant fact to note  lie way advertisers everywhere have sought space in the Magazine. The volume of advertising in the December  Christmas  number was the greatest ever car- ried by a single number of a magazine. This statement is the more impressive when the character of the advertising is taken into con- sideration Thai Mr. Hewlett s story,  Rest Harrow,  will be one of the Magazine s great serials is evident in the very fir.--1 number. No one who becomes acquainted with Sen- house, gypsy, poet, b  itanist, nature lover, philosopher, can re- sist I he charm of the man or lack interest in the world he moves in. 11 is a very human world, and yet one touched with a spirit of r   mancc,of poetry, of ideals. There arc few stories written that take such imme- diate possession of Ihe reader s interest ant I so   lique the curi- osity with regard to future events. Remington Frederick Palmer has succeeded in adding a new and unique lif'lire lo contemporary fiction. Danburv Rodd, Aviator, i- sure to become a popular and en- tertaining hero. The American public dearly loves the doer of deeds, and Rodd, with his en- thusiasm, his masterly and convincing knowl- edge ol aerial navigation, his good nature and love of adventure, is a most attractive personality. Mr. Palmer has made a verv thorough study of aviation and he succeeds in conveying a verv real impression of the sensations of rapid flight in the air. In   The Hermit of Bubbling Water,  in the    ebruary number, Rodd has one of his most ex- citing adventures.   _ 7  7  Readers will welcome the anm tuncement of  The Legend,   another of Mrs. Wharton s inimitable short storiesinherseries,  Tales of Men.  These have been remarkable revelations of quite a new aspect of the aulhor sarl always a finished art  one that has placet  her at the very front of modern short-st orv writers. Her work is almost as well known and admired in Europe as in her own country. SCRIHNEKS MAGA .INI ADVERTISER 1   SHBURM-CROSBYCO Address all correspondence lo Washburn-Crosby Co., Minneapolis. Minn..

T Juja Farm we were wel- comed with the most gen- erous. hospitality by my fel- low-countryman and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. W. N, McMillan. Selous had been staying with them, and one afternoon I had already ridden over from Sir Alfred's ranch to take tea with them at their other house, on the beautiful Mua hills. Juja Farm lies on. the edge of the Athi Plains, and the house stands near the junc- tion of the Nairobi and Rewero Rivers. The house, like almost all East African houses, was of one story, a broad, vine-shaded ve- randa running around it. There were nu- merous out-buildings of every kind; there were flocks and herds, cornfields, a vege- table garden, and, immediately in front of the house, a very pretty flower garden, care- fully tended by unsmiling Kikuyu savages. AIL day long these odd creatures worked at the grass and among the flower beds; ac- cording to the custom of their tribe iheir ears were slit so as to enable them to stretch the lobes to an almost unbelievable extent, and in these apertures they wore fantas- tically carved native ornaments. One of them had been attracted by the shining sur-   Cyjn'Tight, by Charts Scribner's SrtJis, New York., U. S. A.

Special Notice  These articles ire full face of an empty tobacco can, and he wore this in one oar to match the curiously carved wooden drum he carried in the other. An- other,- whose arms and legs were massive with Copper and iron bracelets, had been given a blanket because he had no other garment; he got along quite well with the blanket excepting when he had to use the lawn mower, and then he would usually wrap the blanket around his neck and handle the lawn mower with the evident feeling that he had done all that the most exacting conventionalism could require. The house boys and gun-bearers, and most of the boys who took care of the horses, were Somalis, whereas the cattle keepers who tended the herds of cattle were Masai, and the men and women who worked in the fields were Kikuyus. The three races had nothing to do with one another, and the few Indians had nothing to do with any of them. The Kikuyus lived in their beehive huts scattered in small groups; the Somalis all dwelt in their own little village on one side of the farm; and half a mile off the Masai dwelt in their village, Both the So- malis and Masai were fine, daring fellows; the Somalis were Mohammedans and horse- men ; the Masai were cattle herders, who did their work as they did their fighting, on foot, and were wild heathen of the most martial pr.MPCted und  the n w copyright law cITclI JvJy Iff, tgrn, which imposes s  severe- penalry for infrtti ;ekntnr.

Theylooked carefully after the cattle, and were delighted to join in the chase of dangerous game, but regular work they thoroughly despised. Sometimes when we had gathered a mass of Kikuyus or of our own porters together to do some job, two or three Masai would stroll lip to look on Mr. Bulpett, were not merely mighty hunt- ers who had bagged every important variety of large and dangerous game, but were also explorers of note, whose travels had materi- ally helped in wideningthearea of our knowl- edge of what was once the dark continent. Many birds sang in the garden, bulbuls, MabHi vvnmurs near McMillan'  ranch on the Mua hilU. From j photograph with curiosity,sword in belt and great spear in hand; their features were well cut, their haircuriously plaited, and they had the erect carriage and fearless bearing that naturally go with a soldierly race. Within the house, with its bedrooms and dining-room, its library and drawing-room, and the cool-shaded veranda, everything was so comfortable that it was hard to re- alize that we were far in the interior of Africa and almost under the equator. Our hostess was herself a good rider and good shot, and had killed her lion; and both our host and a friend who was staying with him,  y K  riutt Hoiikfutlt thrushes, and warblers; and from the nar- row fringe of dense woodland along the edges of the rivers other birds called loudly, some with harsh, some with musical voices. Here for the first time we saw the honey guide, the bird that is said to insist upon leading any man it secs to honey, so that lie may rob the hive and give ii a share  though we were nut ourselves fortunate enough to witness anything noteworthy in its actions. Game came right around the house. Ilartebeests. wildebeests, and zebras grazed in sight on the open plain.

I he impalla had lain down as soon as it leai lied   over, and as we entered the fringe of wood I caught a glimpse ol it getting up and making oil. Yet fifty yards farther it stopped again, standing right on the brink ol the pool, so close that w hen I shot it, it fell o er into the water. When, after arranging for this impalla to be i allied bai k to the farm, we returned to where our horses had been lclt. the boys told us with much excitement that there was a large snake near by: and sure enough S Jii-k  in.in;.ii .fiiiu I   . t -i w ho  v .. i milt d by the- 1c   -ir-1 I 1. -.U ; 1...1     1   W   N M  Mdl     a few yard'.    ff.   oiled up in tin- 1    n.n grass under a small tree, was a     11n  n.

Moreover, when they struck the heavy bones they tended to break into fragments, while the big Holland bullets ploughed through. The Winchesterand the Springfield were the weapons one of which I always carried in my own hand, and for any ordinary game I much preferred them to any other rifles. The Winchester did admirably with lions, giraffes, elands, and smaller game, and, as will be seen, with hippos. For heavy game like rhinoceroses and buffaloes, I found that forme personally the heavy Holland was unquestionably the proper weapon. But in writing this 1 wish most distinctly to assert my full knowledge of the fact that the choice of a rifle is almost as much a matter of personal idiosyncrasy as the choice of a friend. The above must be taken as merely the expression of my per- sonal preferences. It will doubtless arouse as much objection among the ultra cham pions of one type of gun as among the ultra champions of another. The truth is that any good modern ritle is good enough. The determining factor is the man behind the gun. In the afternoon of die day on which we killed the rhino Judd took me out again to try for hippos, this time in the Rewcro, which ran close by the house. We rode up- stream a couple of miles; I missed a wart hog on the way. Then we sent back our horses and walked down the river bank as quietly as possible. Judd scanning the pools, and the eddies in the running stream, from every point of vantage. Once we aroused a crocodile, which  dunged into the water. The stream was full of fish, some of considerable size: and in the meadow land on our side we saw a gang of big, black wild-geese feeding. But we got within half a mile of McMillan's house without seeing a hippo, and the light was rapidly fading. Judd announced that we would go home, but took one last look around the next bend, and instantly sank to his knees, beckoning to me. I crept forward on all- fours, and he pointed out to me an object in the stream, fifty yards off, under the over- hanging branch of a tree, which jutted out from the steep bank opposite. In that light I should not myself have recognized it as a hippo head; but it was one. looking toward us, with the ears up and the nostrils, eyes, and forehead above water. I aimed for the centre; the sound told that the bul- let had struck somewhere on the head, and the animal disappeared without a splash, Judd was sure 1 had killed, but I was by no means so confident myself, and there was no wav of telling until next morning, for the hippo always sinks when shot and does not rise to the surface for several hours. Ac- cordingly, back we walked to the house. At sunrise next morning Cuninghamc, Judd, and 1, with a crowd of porters, were down at the spot. There was a very leaky boat in which Cuninghamc, Judd, and I embarked, intending to drift and paddle downstream while the porters walked along the bank. We did not have far to go, for as we rounded the first point we heard tin  porters break into guttural exclamations of delight, and there ahead of us, by a little island of papyrus, was the dead hippo. With the help of the boat it was towed to a convenient landing-place, and then the porters dragged it ashore. 11 was a cow, of good size for one dwelling in a small river, where they never approach the dimensions of those making their homes in a great lake like the Victoria Nvanza. This one weighed nearly two thousand eight hundred pounds, and I could well believe that a big lake bull would weigh between three and four tons. In wild regions hippos rest on sandy bars, and even come ashore to feed, by day; but wherever there are inhabitants they land to feed only at night. Those in the Re- wero continually entered McMillan s gar- den . Where they are numerous they some- times attack small boats and kill the people in them ; and where they are so plentiful they do great damage to the plantations of the natives, so much so that they then have to be taken off the list of preserved game and their destruction encouraged. Their enor- mous jaws sweep in quantities of plants, or lush grass, orcorn or vegetables, ata mouth- ful, while their appetite is as gigantic as their body. In spite of their short legs, they go at a good gait on shore, but the water is their real home, and they always seek it when alarmed. They dive and float wonderfully, rising to the surface or sinking to the bottom at will, anti they gallop at speed along the bottoms of lakes or rivers, with their bodies wholly submerged; butas is natural enough, in view of their big bodies and short legs, they are not fast swimmers for any length of time.

Ii is a ilrilish plant." -  l'r th  r  hook i OF THE NATURE OF A PROLOGUE, DEALING WITH A HRUISED PHILOSOPHER IN RETIREMENT. I N observant traveller, hom- ing to England by the Ost- end-Dovcr packet in the April of some five years ago, relished the vagaries of a curious couple who arrived by a later train, and proved to be both of his acquaintance. He had happened to be early aboard, and saw them come on. They were a lady of some personal attraction, comfortably furred, who, descending from a first-classcarriagc, was met by a man from a third-class, bare-headed, free in the neck, loosely clad in gray flannel trousers, which tlapped about his thin legs in the sea-breeze, a white sweater with a rolling collar, and a pair of sandals upon brown and sinewy feet, uncovered by socks: these two. The man's garniture was extraordinary, but himself, no less so. He had a lean and deeply bronzed facc, hatchet-shaped like a Hindoo s. You looked instinctively for rings in his ears. His hair, densely black, waslongish and per- fectly straight. His eyes were far-sighted and unblinking. He smiled always, but fur- tively, as if the world at large amused him. but must never know it. He seemed to ob- serve everything, exccpt the fact that every- body observed himself. To have once seen such a man must have provided for his recollection; and yet our traveller, who was young and debo- nair, though not so young as he seemed, first recognized the lady.   Airs. Germain, by George   he said to himself.   Now, where s she been all this time    The frown which began to settle about his observing Vol.. XLVII. 2 eyes, speedily dissolved in wonder as they encountered the strange creature in the lady s company. He stared, he gaped, then slapped his thigh. Jack Scnhouse  That s the man. God of battles, what a start  Now, what on earth is Jack Senhouse doing playing courier to Mrs. Germain   That was precisely the employment. His man had handed the lady out of her com- partment, entered it when she left it, and was possessing himself of her littered ves- tiges, while these speculations were afloat. Dressing-case, tea-basket, umbrellas, rugs, and what not. lie filled his arms with them, handed them over to expectant porters, then smilingly showed their proprietress the carriage ridded. He led the way to the steamer, deposited his burdens and saw to the bestowal of others, fetched a chair, wrapped her in rugs, found her book, indi- cated her whereabouts to a mariner in case of need. All this leisurely done, in the way of a man who has privilege and duty for his warrants. Inquiring then, with an engaging lift of the eyebrows, whether she was perfectly comfortable, and receiving with a pleasant nod her answering nod of thanks, he left her and returned to the train. Tracked through the crowd, and easily by his height,bare head, and leisurely motions, he was next seen shouldering a canvas bag on his way back to the boat. Jack s be- longings, his bag of tricks  Jack all over, the same inexhaustible Jack  It was de- lightful to our traveller to find Jack Sen- housc thus verifying himself at ever - turn. He was for the steerage, it appears and of course he was  where depressed foreigners share with bicycles, motor-cars, and newly  7 Rest Harrow boiled pigs the amenities of economical travel. In this malodorous and slipper ' well, his interested friend saw him sit down upon his bundle, r  dl a cigarette, and fall into easy conversation with an Italian voy- ager who, having shaved, was now putting on a clean collar and a tartan necktie. The traveller, M r. William Chcvenix, who had watched him so long, a faultlessly dressed and i heerful Englishman of some livc-and thirty summers, with round eyes in a round and rosy face, now assuring himself that he would be damned if he didn't have it out with the chap, descended the com- panion. picked his way through the steer- age,and approached the seated philosopher. He saw that he was known, and immedi- ately. Nothing escaped Sen house. " How d ve do, how d ye do.-   He held out his hand. Sen house rose and grasped it. The Italian took off his hat and strolled aw ay. " I m verv well, thanks,   he said.   Have you noticed those shores beyond the canal  Samphire there, just as we have it at home. Leagues of samphire.  The younger man looked in the direction indicated, cheerfully and blankly.   The samphire by the ocean s brim. " he said, lightly.   I attach no importance to it what- ever. but ii s very like you to lift one into yourconversation ata moment's notice. I m all lor the formalities, mysell, so I observe that 1 haven t seen you for years. Years  Not since why. it must be eighteen.   'It s precisely eight,  said Senhouse,  and I ve been abroad for four of them.  Ilis friend inspected him with candid interest.  At your old games, I take it. You've lilled Fngland with hardy peren- nials, and now you re starting on Europe. Great field for you You ll want a pretty big trowel, though. A wheelbarrow might be handy, I should have said." Senhouse tired. " I've been planting the Black Forest, you see. Great games. Thev gave me a free hand, and ten thousand marks a year to spend. I've done some rather showy tilings. Non I want to go to Thibet." The other s attention had wandered. " 1 saw you come on board," he said   1 watched you play the Squire ol Dairies to a rather pretty woman whom I happen to have known. She was a Mrs. Germain in those days.     She still calls herself so,  Senhouse said. Tie was staring straight before him out to sea. The steamer was under way.  Married a queer old lilt; in Berkshire, who died worth a plum. Goodish time ago. They called him Fowls, or I owls of the Air. So she s still a widow, eh   Senhouse nodded.  She s his widow. Then he said: " You know her  You might go and amuse her. I can't, because of these bonds.  He exhibited his sockless feet with a cheerful grin. " Oh, I shall, you know,  he was assured.  You re not dressy enough for Mrs. Ger- main I agree. She d never stand it.   She doesn't,  said Senhouse.  She dislikes a fuss, and thinks me rather re- markable.   Well,  said the other,  I think she s ri.uht. You always were a conspicuous beg- gar. Now look at me. Think I ll do    Senhouse peered at him. " I think you are exactly what she wants just now,  he said.  Go in, and approve yourself, Chcvenix   Mr. Chcvenix, the spick and span, had something on his mind which he did not know how to put. He continued to reflect upon Mrs. Germain, but only by way of marking time.   She used to be very good fun in my young days. And she made things spin in Berkshire, they tell me. I know she did in London while il lasted. What s she doing  There was a chap called Duplessis, 1 remember.  " There still is,  Senhouse said, but in such a manner as to chalk No Thoroughfare across the field. Chevenix perceived this rather late in the day, and ended his rumi- nations in a whistle.  She kept him dan- gling  " he had begun. Instead    1 pursuing, he said abruptly, " 1 say, you remember Sancie Percival, of course   A change came over Sen I louse s aspect, which a   lose observer might have noticed, lie was very quiet, hardly moved; but he seemed to be listening with all his senses, listening with every pore  if his skin.   Yes,  he said, slowly. " N es, I do. I m not likely to forget lu-r. She was my dearest friend, and is so still, I hope.  I he solemnity ol his intended message clouded Mr.   hcvenix s candid brow. "She's still at Wanless, you know.  Senhouse set a watch upon himself.  No doubt she is,  lie said  She s well " file other probed him.  She s never Rest Harrow 19 made it up with her people. 1 think she feels it nowadays.  Senhouse asked sharply,  Where s In- gram       Ingram,  said Chevenix,   is just off fora trip. He s to be abroad for a year. India.  Senhouse shivered.  Alone     Well, without her, anyhow. He always was a casual beggar, was Nevile.  He could sec now that he was making a hit.   Got old Senhouse where lie lives,  he told himself.   Fact is, I ve been out with him as far as Brindisi. He asked me to. I had nothing to do. But I want to see Sancie Percival again. I was awfully fond of her  of the whole lot of them.  He reflected, as a man might deliberate upon familiar things, and discover them to be wonders.   What a family they were, by Jove  Five  of the loveliest girls a man could meet with. Melusine, what a girl she was  Mar- ried Tubby Scales fat chap with a cigar. Vicky, now.

A still water what   Senhouse, his shin clasped in his bony hands, contemplated the sea. TIis face was drawn and stern. There wasaqueer twitch- ing of the cheek-bones.   Got him, by Jove   said Mr. Chevenix to himself, and pushed on.  I say, I wish you d go and see her,  he said. Senhouse got up and leaned over the bul- warks. He was plainly disturbed. Chevenix waited for him nervously, but got nothing. Then he said,  The fact is, Senhouse. 1 think that you should go. You were the best friend she ever had.  Senhouse turned him then a tragic face.   No, I wasn t,  he said.   I think I was the worst.  Chevenix blinked.  I know what you mean. If it hadn   t been foryou and your con- founded theories you imply that she-    I don t know   Senhouse began.   God only knows what she might have done. She wa  not of our sort, you know. I always said that she was unhuman.   That s the last thing she was,  said Che- venix, neatly, but Senhouse scorned him.   You don t know anything about it,  he said.  What are the doings of this silly world, of our makeshift appearances, to the essentials  Antics filling up time  You speak as if she gave Ingram everything, and lost it. She did, but he never knew it so never had it. Ingram had what he was fitted to rcccive. Her impulse, her impul- sion, was divine. She has lost nothing  and he has gained nothing.    If you talk philosophy, I m done,  cried Mr. Chevenix.   I m a practical chap, I am; and I say to you, my boy: Go and see her. She's so far human that she s got a tongue, and likes to wag it, I sup- pose. I don t say that there s trouble, and I don t say there s not. But there are the makings of it. She s alone, and may be moped. I don t know. You d better judge for yourself.  He implied more th;in hesaid. Senhouse, trembling from his recent fire, turned away his face.   I don t know that I dare. If she s unhappy, I shall be in the worst place I ever was in in my life. I don t know what I shall do.   That's the first time you ever said that, I ll go bail,  Chevenix interrupted him. But Senhouse did not hear him.   I did everything I could at the time. 1 nearly made her quarrel with me I dared do that. I went up to Wanless and saw Ingram. I hated the fellow, I disapproved of him, feared him. He was the last man in the world I could have tackled with a view to redemption. He was almost hope- lessly bad, according to my view of things. Fed by slaves from the cradle, hag-ridden by his vices; a purple young bully, a prod- uct of filthy sloth, scabbed with privilege. I saw just how things were. She pitied him and thought it was her business to save him. She did nobly. She gave herself for pity; and if she mistook that for love, the splendid generosity of her is enough to take the breath away. The world ought to have gone down on its knees to her but it picked up its skirts for fear she might touch them. What a country  What a race  Well, feel- ing toward her as I did, and loathing him, I urged him to marry her to make her his property for life.

What else was open  I couldn t sec her done to death by a world of satyrs.    Of course you couldn t, my dear man,  cried Chevenix.   Girls of her sort must be married, you know.

" If  u were to see her now,  Chcvenix pul in, " y iu could d   some good. She ll be pretty lonelv up there." Senhouse got up.   I I  sec her." he said. " Whatever hap- pen'.." " Right," said Chcvenix. " That s a good man. That's what I wanted of you. I'll tell her that vmi re coming. Xow, I m go- ing to do the   ivil to M r-.  iermain."

He s all those things, and has two pair of bags to his name, and lives in a cart, and is a gentleman. Xot a doubt about that, mind you. Mrs. Germain." She smiled upon him kindly. " Xonc al all." she said. " I like him extremelv." "   ou would, you know,  said Chcvenix, his tones rich in sympathy.   All w mien do. You couldn't help it. You've got suc h a kind heart. All women have. Xow, I've know n Senhouse himself live or six years, but I ve known about him for at least eight. 1 used to hear about him from morn to dewy eve, once upon a time, from one  of the loveliest and most charming girls you ever met in your life. Did you know her  A Miss Pen ival  Sam Ilia Percival. We used to call her Sancic. Thought you might have met her. perhaps. Xo  Well, this chap Senhouse would have gone through the fire for her.

She used a careless tone, but her flickering evelids betrayed her. "You wouldn t, you know,  he told her with the same sympathetic earnestness. "There was too much ol a row. He was cut all to pieces.

" Is that what you mean   Mrs. Germain showed him her sott Im w n orbs, wliii h for two seas ms had been Rest Harrow 21 said to be the finest pair of dark eyes in Lon- don.   Yes,  she said.  I do mean that. How clever of you to guess    Chevenix bowed to her.  Not at all,  he said.   I m quite good at that kind of thing. You have to be, if you knock, about. Besides, that s the whole point. Bless you  He would just as soon have married Diana of the Ephesians. He said so. I heard him. He would have thought it an insult to hint at it. Didn t 1 tell you that he was a poet   " Yes,  the lady said quickly.   You did. But I suppose poets occasionally marry.    Not that sort,  Chevenix pronounced, with a shake of the head.  At least, they don t many  the right person. They never do. Or there are twoor three persons. Look at Shelley. Look at Dante. I happen to know all about both of  em. Senhouse drank em up and gave  em out like steam. He thought no end of Dante and Shelley. Asa matter of fact, he didn t believe in mar- riage, as a game as a kind of institution, you know. He thought it devilish wrong  and said so and that s where the trouble was. Marry Sancie  1 wish to Heaven he had. There d have been no trouble at all. They were made for each other. She loved his fun and was easy with him, you see. She was queerish, too a shy young bird; but she was quite at home with him. No, no. The trouble really began with him putting her out of conceit with marriage. And she didn t care for him in that sort of way, then. And then well, the less said the better.   Oh,  said Mrs. Germain, absorbed by the devolutions of the talc.   Oh      Oh   s the sort of expression one used at the time, said Chevenix.  There wasn t much else to be said. It was a holy row.  He mused, he brooded, and said no more. Luckily for him, he discovered Do- ver at hand, and cscapcd. Mrs. Germain was put into a first-class carriage by two attendant squires, provided with tea and a foot-warmer; and then Chevenix bowed himself away and Senhouse disappeared. She had a novel on her knees, but read little. She looked out of window, frowning and biting her red lip. W hen she reached Victoria, she tightened both lips, and you saw that so compressed, they made a thin red line straight above a square chin. Her charm and favor both lay, you then dis- covered, in expression. Senhouse, hatless and loose limbed, stood at the door to help her out. She accepted his services, and was put into a cab.   Where s he to take you    lie asked her pleasantly. She said at once,  To Brown s Hotel.  Then, before she got in, with a hand, un- perceived by the general, just touching his arm:   J ack, I want to speak to you, but not to-night. Will you come in the morning, please  I am rather tired, and shall dine early and go to bed. Is my maid here   She looked about.  Oh, I suppose she's seeing to the luggage. You might find her, and tell her where to come to.  Senhouse smiled and nodded.   Certain- ly; all these things shall be done. Anything else before you go off   She hesitated for a minute, then said,   Yes, there is one more thing. You must- n t cometoBrown s like that. You must put on ordinary' things.  He raised his eyebrows, then laughed  throwing his head up. "Wonderful lady  Wherewithal shall 1 be clothed   Do you really think these things matter   She was firm.   I really do. I hope you will be kind enough to to please me.  He looked very kindly at her.   My dear.  he said,  of course I shall. Be quite easy about it.  He held out his hand.  Good- night, Mary.  She took it, but didn't meet his look.  Good-night,  she said, and drove away without another signal. Senhouse, shouldering his bundle, found the lady's maid, and gave her her sailing or- ders. His manner to her was exactly that which he had shown to the mistress, easy, simple, and good-humored. Leaving her, he went a leisurely way through the press, and took a tram-car from the corner of Vauxhall Bridge Road in the direction of Battersea. II Senhouse, after a night of solitary mus- ing upon certain waste places known best to outlanders, walked up St. James s Street at six o clock in the morning, talking lightly and fiercely to himself. A long life of lone- liness had given him that habit incurably. Discovering the hour by a clock in Picca- dilly, he realized that it was too early to wait upon Mrs. Germain in Albemarle Street, so continued his way up the empty hill, en- tered the Park, and Hung himself upon the Rest Harrow turl under the elms.    ther guests were harbored by that hospitable sward, sham- bling, downcast lice of the town. These, having shuffled thither, dropped, huddled, and slept. Mis wav was not theirs: to him the open space was hisdomain. He ranged the streets, one saw . as it they had l een the South I tow ns, w ith the long stride and sen- sitive tread ol a man who ret kons with in- equalities of footing. So now he ranged the fenced park. The country and the town were earth alike, though now of springing grass, and now again ol flagstones. His face, after a night of fierce self- searching, looked its age, that of a man past fort  ; his as pet. I upon affairs was no more a detached observer s; his eves were hard, his smile was bleak. Sodden misery, stupor, anil despair lay all about him, and would have drawn In.- pitying comments, if it had not been so with him that all his concern must now be for himself.  She wants me, and 1 must go to her," was the burden of his thought; hut. like a recurring line in a poem, it com luded very diverse matter.   1 played the traitor to her; I could not wait and yet. 1 must have known.

Blue sky w hite clouds, shining on the just and the unjust, covered Her in Yorkshire and him, her grim knight, in Mayfair. He stalked, gaunt and hag- gard-eyed, down the hill, threading his way through the growing traffic of the day, and laced his business with the ladv in the case. Mrs. Germain was serious when he en tcred her sitting-room. She was in a loose niorning-gownof lace anil pink ribbon, l ink was her color. Her dark eyes looked heavy. She should have been adorable, and she was but not to him just now . He stood be- lore her, looked at her where she sat with her eyes cast down at her hands in her lap. She had let them rest upon him for the moment ol his entry, but had not greeted him. Now, as he stood watching her, she had no greeting. "  lood morning, Mary,  he said pres Rest Harrow 23 ently, and she muttered a reply. He sasv at once that she was prepared for him, and began, in the middle.

Shesatper- fectly still, looking at her white hands. Her heavy eyelids, weighted with all the knowl- edge she had, seemed beyond her power of lifting. He was driven to speak again, and, against his will, to defend himself.  I am in a hatefully false position. I ought to have told you long ago all about it. It seemed impossible at the time, and so from time to time, to open the shut book. I closed it deliberately, andfromthe timeof do- ing it until this moment I have never spoken of it, even to myself. Chevenix, who knew her well, broke it open unawares yesterday  and now we must read in it, you and I.  Hestopped, took breath, and began again.   I don't see how you can forgive me, or how I can, so to speak, look myself in the face again. I have played theknave so long with you, that it is perhaps the greatest knavery I can commit to be honest at last. But I am going to do it, Mary. I want to tell you the whole story. You have told me yours.  Her eyesflickered at that, butshesaid noth- ing. Passive as she sat. heavy in judgment, she was yet keenly interested. All her wits were at work, commenting, comparing, judg- ing, and weighing every word that he said. He told her a. strange, incoherent story of poet s love. 'J'his mysterious, shrouded Sanchia figured in it as the goddess of a shrine omnipresent, a felt influence, yet never a woman. He spoke her name with a drop of the voice; every act of hers, as he related it, was colored by sanction to seem the dealing of a divine person with creeping mankind. To Mrs. Germain it was all preposterous; if he had owned the humor- ous sense, it wouId have been tragically ah- surd. For what did if amount to, pray, but this, that Jack Senhouse had been in love with a girl who had loved somebody else, had married her choice, and was now repenting it  Jack, then, in a pique, had trilled with her, Mary Germain, and made love to her. Now he found that his Sanchia was to be seen, he was for jumping back. Was he to jump, or not to jump   Did it lie with her  Jack seemed to think that it did. If it did, what did she want   As to one thing she had long been clear. Jack Sen- house was a good lover, but would be an impossible mate. She had found his gypsy tent and hedgerow practice in the highest degree romantic. With gypsy practicc, he bad. the wheedling gypsy ways.

She felt that here, at last, was a man indeed to be trusted. For she had been there with him, and not a living soul within miles, entirely at his discretion  and he had not so much as kissed her fingers. No, not even that though he had wanted to. That she knew, as women do know such things. Romantic indeed, trustworthy  Why, a Bayard, a Galahad of a gypsy  After this adventure, after he had driven her back to her duty, she had owned allegiance to nobody else in the world. And when her husband died, she had renounced her widow right, embraced hardship, kept herself by teaching; and when 6nally he came to her and offered her her choice, she had chosen Poverty for her lord as single-heartedly as ever did Francis find his Lady in a beggar s garb. And that being done, it did not  do.  That was how she put it now; but the proc- ess had been slow, and never defined. He had carried her off to Baden for his work of naturalising plants. Ho had a great name for that, a European name. In three weeks his work absorbed him; within that time she knew that she was no mate for him. You can't be picturesque for ever, she thought. She had never reckoned with his incredible simplicity, had never for a mo- ment connected his talk with his acts. Per- haps J ack was the only really logical man in  he world. Now she found that in talking of Poverty as the only happiness, he liter- ally and really believed it so. He would own nothing but the barest necessities neither pictures nor furniture, neither clothes nor books. Pictures, furniture  Why, he had no roof to shelter them  Clothes  Where was he to carry them, if not on his back  24 Rest Harrow Books  He Wad half-a-dozen, which con- tained all the wisdom of the world. So he used to cry. Now, this might be as it was  but when he seemed to expect her to be of the same mind and behavior, you will sec that he must needs he mad. Yet so it was. He had lived in a tent for twenty years, so took his tent to Germany, and went on living in it. In that, with com- plete gravity, he received the Grand Duke of Baden, and several uniformed high of- ficials, who wore plumed headgear and in- credibly high collars and glittering boots of patent leather. Folded superbly in cloaks of milky blue, they looked to Mary like gods; to Senhouse lliey were amusing fellow- creaturcs, interested in his plants and plans. He spread maps on the ground, and fol- lowed his racing finger with racing speech. His German was faulty, but exceedingly graphic. His words shook the lent-cur- tains. Within half an houT, such was the in- fection of his eloquence, he had most of his company on their knees beside him, and the Grand Duke, accommodated with a camp-stool, buried his hand in his beard, and followed every line without a breath, Of all in that tent, she, Mary Germain, had been the only person to feel the indescrib- able squalor in the situation and she the only one who might have been born to it; for her upbringing had been humble, and her rise in the world sudden and short of durance. But she knew now that she had hardly been able to live it out for very-shame. Directly the visitors had departed there had been a scene she, in tears of vexation which scalded, and he, concerned at her trouble, but unable for the life of him to see what it was all about. He had been kind- ness itself. He always was the kindest and gentlest creature. If she wanted a house, hotel, or what not, she should have it. In fact, he got her one, installed her, and un- dertook to keep her there. She bit her lip now to remember that she had agreed and the ensuing difficulties. He had no money, and would have none of his own, and he refused to live under a roof on any terms whatsoever. Of ten thousand marks a year, which he was to receive from his Grand Duke, half was to be hers; he would see her when she would, and she must fol- low him about as she would or not, if she would not. He could not see that there was anything extraordinary in these proposi- tions. To him, it was the simplest thing in the world that two people should do as they pleased. Society  What in the name of God had society to do with it   She re- membered her tears, and his blank dismay when he saw them. He thought that she was unhappy, and so she was, but she was grievously angry also, that she could not make him see what things would   do,1' and what things never  do.  His work had inflamed him; he had marched from place to place, unencum- bered. and without a thought or care in the world inspired with his scheme, in which plants stood for the words in a poem. He slept out many nights on the I'elsen berg, on the ground, wrapped in a cloak. He dis- appeared for weeks at a time, in impene- trable forests, sharing the fires of charcoal burners, mapping, planning, giving orders to a secretary from the botanical depart- ment, as wild as a disciple should be. There was nothing for her, poor lady, but to sit about in hotel saloons the widow of an English gentleman, occasionally visited by an eccentric friend. So she put it, for the benefit of society; but this had not been her idea of things when she had tumbled into Senhouse s arms nor had it been his. Her ruling idea in these days of disen- chantment and discomfort and it was her ruling idea still was to preserve ap- pearances. The great, invincible, funda- mental instinct of the class from which she had sprung; to keep one s self unspotted by the world. The variation upon the text is Senhouse s own, done in a moment of exas- peration over her untiring effort to appear what she was not, and did not want to be. She loved theman sincerely; if she had been married to him, she would have kept faith- fully to his side. But she had no lines; her wedding-ring was not of his giving. With- out these assurances she simply could not love him. It came to that. He had, when they had first approached the matter of alliance, put aside marriage, literal marriage, as out of the question. He took it airily for granted that she agreed with him. The servitude of the woman which it implied was to him unspeakably wicked. He could not have treated the vil- est woman in such a, manner. But he had reckoned without the woman in her case. Freedom to love, without sanction or ob- ligation, destroyed love. When he found Rest Harrow that out, which he did after a year, lie of- fered himself and his convictions to her. He humbled himself before her but by that time she would not. By that time she had recovered her widow s portion  which had been dependent upon her remaining sole , and was entitled to some thousands a year, and a good dower house in Berks. She de- clined to marry him, and acted as such. She had been Ids wife in fact for a quarter of a year; she was his friend as he was hers for the rest of their time abroad. He had respected her wish, but had kept him- self at her free disposal, until now, of late, when this disturbing Sanchia Percival arose out of the nothingness, and wasshown to her as a goddess newly from the shades. And so now, here sat Airs. Germain, with her ec- centric friend, pale and gaunt, before her, un- like himself as she had always known him, about to take her at her word, and to behave as a friend might. What should she say  He would come back if she chose; he had said so and lie was incapable of lies. If he came back, and if she chose, he would marry her, and be the imperturbable, de- lightful, incalculable, impossible compan- ion she had always known him. He would marry her and decline to come under her roof. He would, perhaps, pitch his tern in her paddock; he would sit at her table in sweater and flannels, sandals on his feet, while she and her guests were in the ordi- nary garbof gentlefolks. Gentlefolks  Yes. But the maddeningand baffling thought was a conviction: he would be the greatest gen- tleman there. She knew that. Lord of his mind, lord of his acts, easy in his will, and refusing to bow to any necessity but that, he would he the superior of them all.

And she must be beautiful or Jack would- n't speak of her as lie had. lie hushed his voice down, he spoke as if she was a god- dess, as if to disobey her call was out of the question. A dull heat siirred her deeply within, and she found herself setting her teeth together. No  Jack had brought her to this pass and she would not be left. These were the thoughts of Mrs. Ger- main as she sat very still, with heavy lid- ded eyes, listening to Senhouse s story. He ended il in thesewords:   Youcharmcd me, Mary, and you still charm me. You are very sweet, and I shall never want a dearer mate than you might be, if you would. I vow to you that you are the only woman with whom I have wished to live, as we might live if you would. I can t make you see, I m conscious, what I feel about Sanchia  but it s certainly not that. My little dear, can t you trust me     He looked down and saw her tears slowly dropping; lie was very much moved, knelt by her side. She turned her face away, dangerously moved also. She struggled with her tears, her face contorted, her bosom heaving in riot. Senhouse took her hands, but she wrenched them away and covered her face with them. Passion grew upon her, passion of regret, of loss, of rage, of desire  Oh,leave me, leave me  Oh, cruel, cruel  No man in the world could be so cruel   and then she sprang up and faced him, flushed and fierce as a woman whom love has made mad.

I hope I shall never see you again.  Her great eyes loomed in her hot face like beacons. Her color was high, her lips vivid. She looked as beautiful as an Indian flower. She was lighting for her own like a cat. An absent, shadowy, icily pure San- chia could never contend with this quivering reality of scarlet and burning brown; and the man stood disarmed before her, watch- ing her every movement and sensible of every call of her body. Her wild words pro- voked him, her beauty melted him; pity for her, shame, memories of what he had be- lieved her, impossible visions of what she might be: he was tossed this wav and that, was whirled,engulfed,overwhelmed. There Rest 11 arrow is "nls one en l to surli strifes. With a -hurl cry he threw up hi- ;irm .  God help us, 1 .  'tay   he- said, and took her.

Now, in all his previous relations with this sex, while he had given much of himself, he had never met before with a woman whose need was the measure   if her allure. If she had noi wanted him so much, lit: would never have thought ol her tw ice. Hut this was precisely w hat had happened. She had acted upon him as a vacuum upon air. Her helplessness, her ignorance, her appalling belief in him, her clinging power, heighten- ing her physical charm, had sucked him in in a stream; and when she was full of him, lie was emptv. She had been the lirsi to find it out. 1 laving trailed him in her wake for a season, against his instincts, against his con.-cience, she presently coaxed him lo let her go.

He proposed now to resume his former life of sojourn in tents, and desultory prac- tice of the arts, a life w hich, as it was at once highlv practical, and entirely dependent up- on enjoyment, we may call one of contem- plative activity. For twenty years he had not lived in a house, slept in a bed,or owned anything beyond the barest necessities.  The only thing he had, indeed, found him- self owning had at last removed itself.  lie had been by turns poet, painter-in-water- c-.lors, linker, botanizer. antinomian, and anarchist; and attributed his success in all these busy walks lo the fact that he was as stronglv averse t   the possession of prop- erty as he was incapable of getting any. Here, then, was his capital, with which to commence the world again. With this at his back, you would have said, he had but to pack his knapsack, stow his tent, and take to the road. But that was not so. I Ie had, with the purest intentions, broken all the laws of society. Entitled to a com- petence, he had had neither house nor gear, earned just so much as would keep him in food. He knew what it was to go without a dinner, and what to sleep under the stars. Vet he had been extraordinarily happy. He had held up his head, and kept it, alike with the learned  for he had learning and with the simple, whose simplicity he shared. He had had the knack, in fact, of getting him- self acccpted on his own terms, exorbitant as they w ere ; and of both rich and poor alike he had demanded entire equality.   Bare- foot I stand,  had been his proposition,  of level inches with your lordship, or of you, my hedgerow acquaintance. Take me for a man, decently furnished within, or take me not at all. Take me never, at least, for a clothes-horse.'  In all these things, which he had pn  laimed far and wide, in divers tongues, all of them eloquent, he had vio- lated the unwritten laws of our country, as great and small know them to be. Chiefest he broke them in being happy. That was outrageous. But he was now, it seemed, confronted with a Law of Nature when he found that, having broken with a way of life, you cannot resume it; not because it isn t there  for there it is , but rather be- cause you are not there yourself. You are elsewhere, and the road is hard to find. At forty two, you are not the mountaineer of thirty-seven. Worse than that, worst sign of all. you don t want to be. Here was a shock for the Poet in him, whit h it was the Philosopher's task to allay. Rest Harrow 27 In heated debate, the two contended for his reasonable soul. Poet: I am young. Philosopher: You put it so. You are forty-two, and as old as you feel. Poet: Away with you. 1 am young, I tell you. There arc worlds to see.

Let me remind you that Sanchia- Poet: Remind me of nothing. I remem- ber everything. She was the dayspring from on high. When I think of Greece, I think not of Plato and Sophocles; but of things more delicate and shy: of the tender hedge flowers of the Anthology, of Tana- gra and its maidens in reedy gowns, of all of this in a sweet, clean light. Ah, and I think of Her, as I saw her first in the wood- land, in her white gown, with the sun upon her hair. She was like the fluting of a bird  clear melody. She girt herself high, and set her foot in the black water. She dipped her pure body in above the knees. She, the noblest, the wholesomest, the youngest of the gods. Remind me of nothing, 1 beg you. Philosopher: 1 must really remind you of this. You renounced her of your own deliberation, and promised to dance at her wedding. Poet  with a sob : So I would, God bless her  Philosopher: That is a charitable sen- timent. I have done you good. Poet: You are an ass. I have summarized an argument which was really prolonged and very acrimonious. The Philosopher prevailed, and the Poet, beaten at every point, forswore what am- bitions remained to him, built himself a shepherd s hut in a valley of the Wiltshire Downs, and planned out his Memoirs in three stout volumes. Volume I,  King s Lynn ; Volume II,  Middle Kingdom ; Volume III,  Shep- herd s Crown,  are titles which indicate the scope and spirit of a projected work. They were characteristically chosen before a line was written; nor, indeed, was a single other word put to paper, not so much as an Ad- vice to the Reader, for two years. The building of his house with his own hands, and the disposition of the land about it, oc- cupied him for the better part of one; the next, with its progressive seasons of fruition, was spent in meditative ecstasy; by the beginning of the third his cure was com- plete. The Poet in him was now the Phil- osopher s humble servant, as should surely always be the case. Resolved that the world should be sweetened yet, he attacked his Book. He began with the third volume, in which, under the heading of  Shepherd s Crown,  he proposed to discharge himself of the con- clusions of his ripened manhood upon the world, as he now saw it from his grassy out- look. Not yet could he trust himself with  King s Lynn.  That was for Thoughts. That was to be filled with spheral music, which lay under lock and bolt deep within his nature. Before he could set that free to throb and beat in his brain, he must be quite sure that it could not win a way back into his heart. For She of whom it must consist, whose very name was music, whose presence, as he said, was like the  luting of a bird, was the renounced, impossible San- chia; that Sanchia whom, for reason clear and good, he had loved  upon his knees, with covered eyes  and suffered to go her ways. The Philosopher was clear upon the point that Volume I must be withheld for a season; and that Volume II, if il was to deal with the enchantment of the flitted Mary, must wait also. Mary must be charitably handled; give her time. In Volume III, now, we were to have neither music on the one hand, nor the sharp fragrance of loose hair and warm breath on the other; but green thoughts, rather,  calm of mind, all passion spent,  as surely, at forty-two, it must be. Let the wise book deal with Life, 28 Rest Marrow not the living; with Love, not of woman; with Death, but not of the body. Earlv in the third year, this wanderer, come to anchor, began his book, and al his task I propose to leave him nntil near the end of mine. But, that he shall know the man again when the tale hath need of him, the reader will be pleased to accompany me into his neighborhood for a moment. Into the great ridge of chalk which is the backbone of South Wilts, and runs cast and west from Sarum to Shaftesbury, there cuts up from the south a deep, winding, and narrow valley. The hills, between whose breasts it runs a turfy way, fold one into the other; a man coming up from Dorset, and minded to strike across country to Marl- borough, might well pass within two hun- dred yards of our recluse, and never see a sign of him. It was at the head of this glen, sheltered by hills from north, east, and west, but open full to the south, that he had built his one-storied, deep-eaved house of larch and shingles. Here, under the sky, he watched and labored and slept, and saw nobody, living principally on vegetables of his own growing, and cheese, which he made from the milk of a flock of goats. Bread he had once a week from a peasant s cottage at the valley s foot; gypsy folk brought him occasionally tea and tobacco. For the most part he drank water, and was too good a traveller to be rooted to his pipe. The ground behind him sloped sharply up to the ridgeway, which we call the Race Plain in those parts, and had nourished, when he first took up his rest below it, little but nettles, mulleins, and scrub of elder. A few fair trees ash, thorn, spindle, service  struggled with the undergrowth, which should live. He was for the trees, needing their shade; cleared the ground, terraced it with infinite pains, and utilized the water of a mist pool which he had made on the high land by a system of canals of remarkable neatness and ingenuity. Tree trunks, split and hollowed out, conveyed what water he wanted, as and whither lie would. To the west of his dwelling the slope was gentler, and there woods and brake-fern grew peacefully together, and made a line refuge from the heats. Behind this shelter, hidden from sight of the house, he had a broad lynch for his vegetables, and grew and protected them to be the envy and de- spair of rabbits. In the woods, and below, in the valley bottom, where wind-sown thorns made a natural park,his goats found eatage. lie reserved the terraces about the house for the flowers which he loved and understood. He was an expert gardener, who in his day had been famous for his skill in natural- ization. His feats in this work have made a stir beyond ourshores. Alpine plants grew wild upon English lock faces at his whim, irises from the glaring crags of the Caucas- us spread out their filmy wings, when he bade them, on Devonshire tors. These wonders he chose not to repeat for rea- sons. Pence, to begin with, failed him. The work itself was associated with the hap- piest and the saddest moments of his life; he had not the heart to begin it. Moreover, in the course of his year s work of house-build- ing and settling in, he had kept an eye for Nature s way in his valley, and when it came to making a flower-garden, he found that she had one there to his hand. He said,  Nothing is lovelier in flowers than true color. Form is nothing toNature; il is one of Art s tricks. Here I may have a succession of pure washes by mere concen- tration of what I find. The downs give me everything; all 1 have to do is to group them.  Here is my design: For early spring, cowslips in a cloud. Scattered broadcast, they are happy accidents which you come upon walking; but if you mass them, their scent tells; and you find they arc nearer the color of oranges than of limes.  For mid-April and early May, I have the orchids a blood-spatter on the bottom; higher the flecked white, the pink, and the yellow with brown. Then for a shelf among rocks, the milk-worts the sky-blue, the white, and the pink: with these I float out May like Fra Angelico. For June, there are ragged robins, like filaments of rosy cloud, and forget-me-not, to drift like wood smoke over the chalk rubble. In July, I have a pageant. Foxglove and eglantine make melodious my woods; lady s-slipper gives a golden cope for the hillside, with purple campanula to wind about it like a scarf. After this August, September, Oc- tober our uplands faint out in semitones: gray scabious, gray harebell, pale bedstraw, white meadowsweet, like the lace of an old lady s cap.

The Continent Limited had left New York at . .40 anil they were wonderful eyes. Their appeal thrilled Danbury Rodd like a call for help from over the waters. He was not seeking adventure. Whv should he when his occupation made ad venture reek of the shop  Rather, he had promised himself the novelty of an evening of relaxation in the commonplace. Indif- ferently watching the people passing in and out of the main door of the  ireat Century Hotel, and the cross currents of humanity on the avenue, while he waited for a friend with whom he was to have an early dinner, there was no reason why he should particu- larly observe a young man who arrived in a two sealed runabout. Sm Ii young men are frequent at the  ireat Century. If this one enjoyed any distiiii lion from type it was in seeming t  1 lie over well   ileased with himself. After sending up his card he took a seat near Rodd. He had not lorn; to wait. Rodd saw him rise buoyanlh with a smile of greeting, onh to slop abruptly, as if struck by a chilling draught whi  h had issued from the elevator door at the same time as the person whom he was expecting. Bv raising his brows Rodd now witnessed a bit out oi a third ait ol a drama of sup- pressed emotion, with the second principal a voting woman. She came sw il ily, theswee  1 of some resolution driving her-tops. She v. as high strung, exquisite, with a slight lig- ure. lie noticed instantly. Hut this became an irrelevant detail afler he had seen her eves. These were gloriously burning with some message she had to deliver. The young man w as evidently to Iie its recipient. She halted before him with a militant and impetuous finality, which crumpled him in discomfiture. "I ought not to have accepted and I m not going,  she said.  Vou have grown very sober. Not go- ing. you say  Why -' he asked, blankly. She granted him silence lor his flounder- ing words, without appearing to hear them, and proceeded, her voiie tense as a taut w i re "Xo  1  h, I wish I had taken the train  Ih"  with an accent on the pronoun w hi  h seemed only to mystify her listener-   will never forgive me.

He did not get sentimental about them. lie was sentimental about nothing except the weather reports. His I um ern was how to win her consent to his plan. More pressing slill was the problem of simply introducing himself under cir- cumstances contrary to every convention.

Il was now the third second - a terrible one. What an absolutely fan- 32 Her Compelling Eyes tastic mission he had embarked on  Cold little beads were forming on his forehead at the monstrousness of his ymrsuit. Either he must retreat or speak, and incoherently his uppermost idea sprang to his lips.   I beg your pardon,  he said,   but 1 believe the thing is possible. It is fair all the way, except for a slight centre of de- pression near Erie.  She whipped around with a stare, and those eyes were so forbidding that he was inclined to run, until he saw them stricken with something like fear, well founded from the nature of his irrational speech.  I'm not mad.  he explained,  and I do beg your pardon.   Well you may, considering that I don't remember ever having met you,  she an- swered sharply, now holding her ground.  No. But I couldn t help it after over- hearing what you said. Please do listen for a moment. I m not armed and I hate to waste the time to bring   Who s Who  from the hotel desk. They might not have the latest edition and probably that s the only one I am in; because, you see, the whole business is so strictly up to date.  She began to take his measure. He was sandy-haired, frecklcd, short-nosed, with an aerial intensity and the appeal of a cos- mic ingenuousness. If he were a lunatic he was in a harmless mood and he did not seem inclined to come any nearer.   In a word,  he said, more directly, hav- ing partly overcome his mortal embarrass- ment,   I believe I can have you in the station in Cleveland to-morrow morning when the Continent pulls in.   You could   Those eyes centred in two dancing points of inquiry. But their curiosity was evanescent. In its place was a flame of resentment at giving his remark a moment's consideration.  What non- sense   she exclaimed.  Indeed  How   she asked, as if she were determined by a practical question to teach this ridiculous creature that she was no fool.   By simply trusting to me, nothing else. It s very easy.   Well, of all the   she found no ex- pression adequate. A frown gathered over the blaze of her eyes. Evidently she had had enough of him.   That s the only way in an aeroplane," he hastened to say.   1 was so excited with the idea that I forgot to mention that detail.  " I J give my eyes to bt in Cleveland before the Continent Limited    _Page 31.   'Il ink if there should In  Quick comprehension smoothed her brow and she paused.  Then you must be Danbury Rodd,  she said.   Of course  And what you propose is that I shall go up in thenir with a stranger because I did not take a train. You have a very extraordinary way of introducing yourself, and as you do not seem to know any better" she was pedagogically severe    I will excuse your rudeness if you do not persist." Naturally he persisted. He wanted to beat the Continent Limited: and the sport of the thing was to do it with one of the Continent s passengers.  I left the machine quite ready and the trip is perfectly safe. If that Erie squall is not too widespread we can go around it. Wc may have a chance," he added, de parting on another tangent of incoherency lighted by a smile, in the hope, possibly, of appealing to her sense of romance,  yes. wc may have a chance to make a bow-knot in the tail of a comet. That is great fun. Some day I expect to hang one on the moon s neck for a scarf, with a star for a pin.

Was he really impertinent or was he as extraordinary and fantastic and withal as genuine as public report painted him   When I have just refused to go un- chaperoned in a runabout, do you sup- pose 1 would accept this offer   Then she herself, unconscious of her inconsistency, put in play that pronoun which he had so repreheiisibly brought into the discussion. " Yes, and what would he say to such a reckless, daredevil thing as that    But it isn t a runabout it's an aero- plane," he answered, as if this were an argument which would turn a Supreme Court decision into Sophistry. "An auto- mobile is conventional; an aeroplane is still so unconventional that no one expects any conventions.   Of all lunacy  And I stand here and listen to you  It s impossible out of the question   she answered.  Very well. I ve done my best. I ve made the offer and have a free conscience,  he said, and turned back to press the ele- vator button, grave disappointment written on his face. She half wheeled in her tracks only to hall majestically, as if resenting his theft of her right to dismiss him. 33 Her Compelling Eyes  I think I ll try it myself anyway,  he concluded, as the elevator door swung open,   just to show that 1 really can beat the Continent    In that case it is delightful, if it is lunacy', in that case   she paused, and her eyes seemed to be conducting a war of sparkles between valor and discretion.   Of course, my posi lion is that of a chauffeur,  be explained.  Yours is like ordering a special car or taking a cab.  IZe was as impersonal as a smooth-run- ning dynamo and he seemed equally trust- worthy in this new rendering of the situa- tion. He saw the eyes grow calm and royal. Their glance seemed to cut off a foot of his height. They made him conscious of the scrubby nail-ends of his mechanic s fingers, used to personal attention to re- pairs. "In that case, I will avail myself of the opportunity,  she said, quietly. All ready for automobiling. she was equally ready for avialion. Five minutes after they had ascendcd in the elevator they descended together to tempt fate with wings. They took the subway express and all the way uptown she made no answer to any of his remarks, but with impressive self-possession studied an advertisement of a child with a face as broad as a tureen-cover that seemed unable to get enough soup. Evidently his position was fised. He was llie chauffeur; he was Mr. Mercury.  Every minute counts a mile for the Continent, and it must count a mile and a quarter for us,  he said, as they alighted. He ran up the stairs to the street and she ran beside him and kept up easily with his rapid stride to the aero shed two blocks distant, where she stood at one side silent, a study in repressed emotion, while he brought his racing machine, the Falcon, out into the light. He gave engine and fittings a swift inspection, and bade her take her place in the single seat beside the drivers. This she did without a word, like one in a dream. Then, suddenly, as if discretion had risen in tumult against valor, she cried: "No, no  I can t  It s madness  Think if there should be an accident     But there will not he. I can always land all right, now. That problem is solved.  The vision of the scandalous proceeding into which she had been tempted only grew more forbidding.  But there might be  Land all right, you say   her sentences coming in gusts.  Where  Out in some pasture in Ohio  and all the world would know about il and he would know about it that I d been fly- ing across the country alone with a stranger 11 Rodd viewed that objection sis lightly as if it were a cobweb which she had mistaken for an insurmountable wall.   lie'll not have a wireless as to the ex- act spot of this hypothetical accident, so as to be on hand when we drop and you have a veil. You need not lift that until after you are aboard the train at the nearest railroad station and on your way back to New York. However, il never does to take up one who is afraid, and-   Afraid   All doubt passed out of her eyes. They scorned him; they laughed defiantly. She settled back in her scat as the motor began singing. For a second there was the strain- ing effect of one who is trying to lift him- self by the boot-tops, before some in viable giant, with the strength ol" the solar system in his fingers, bore them off the ground. The windows of Harlem were a maze of checkery flames, succeeded in stcreopticon abruptness by a magic apron of farmland unfolding on the other side of the Hudson, which was gone like the sweep of a silver thread across the retina as the talcon set its course westward. She realized their speed only if she measured by a hill ora village growing out of the confusion of the dusky green of even-tide. All the roads seemed running in the direction of their flight. The others were merged in the gathering dusk and flitting landscape. He tried to start a conversation, which was so one-sided that lie grew dubious of hearing any more about the mysterious he. Apparently, such intimate affairs were not for the chauffeur.  That s Hinghamton,  he remarked, after a long silence, as they passed south- ward of a big town.   I know it well, for I had a breakdown and stopped over for lunch there once.  He looked at the clock attached to the frame at his feet.  We haven t a speedometer that will take ac- count of the currents yet, but by elapsed time and counting the revolutions we ve been doing a hundred an hour.  They had an average of one hundred and ten when they saw the glow of Buffalo in the distance shortly after midnight. The Dr tvn by   '. C. VohH 4iIt will be a race I'  she cried.

Her thoughts reverted to the hotel lobby. Her eyes burned as they did when she dismissed that young man.

Up to 4.50 it was still an undiscovered land. At 4.30 I met Air. Jerold and concluded, on his urging to go out with him this after- noon. to a week end at his aunt's. At 4.50 I was on my way back to my hotel to change my gown when this great tiling happened to me. I saw all the foolishness, all the smart ness and little day-by-day pleasures and flirtatious tendrils, and then in deep I found the kernel and what a great, sweet kernel it was  I knew Joe would be warranted in never speaking to me again.  She was somewhat disconnected, even prolix, it seemed to Rodd. He wondered if Joe were he, which was an unnecessary conjecture, as she was already explaining.  And Mr. Jerold was one of the llirt.i tions. Suddenly I saw this superficial be ing in his true light. 1 knew he wanted Vol. Xr.VM. 4 me for my money lie didn t love me and, anyway, he was just a passing hgure. By this time I had missed the train. I had missed it purposely to go to Westchester, when he" yes, evidently he. was Joe   had wired me he was postponing going to St. Louis so we could have the week end at mother s, with Sunday at the farm. Joe is simple, all wool and strong, not clever  anil I m so glad he isn't and we have been as good as engaged for a long while. I've kept putting him otf and having a good lime without knowing what was inside my heart till this afternoon, when I struc k the mine of gold. He s very jealous whi  h isn t altogether a fault, is it  and lie -; been nobly patient. " lie's just this kind : when he comes to a certain line he will cross it and never rccross it. And i " he had ever heard that when he was waiting for me I was such a silly, thoughtless, worthless girl as to be led off to a house party by that man. he would choke a little and press up his square rhin and cross that line. And there i'd be, with that mine of gold I had just found turned to ashes, looking at his sturdy back forever. Now I've told you everything  Now you see why I want to be in the sta- tion at Cleveland when he comes to meet me      I think you will,  lie answered.   unless this Erie washout interferes.  The air grew humid and cooler, like a spray of invisible electric points in its tick ling rush against thc-ir faces. A cl  aid blank- eted the siar-.   I think I may as well try t   pass over it,  he said.  There s no telling how far I d have to go in order to pass around it." Their speed was that of the wind-driven thunderhead they saw marching above the landscape. They had a glimpse of light- ning under their feet; space enveloped them.   The crops are getting a much-needed rain below, without a drop for us -not yet. Here's another and a higher cloud.  This shut out the moonlight. They were in chill and inky darkness. Hail plaved a drumbeat on the cloth and hissed on the cylinders for a few minutes, before they striak across current of wind with a tor- nado force. The Fa eon was still like the yacht, but riding a choppv sea, rocketing and diving. "There is no danger,  lie explained. 3K Her Compelling Eyes   I am sure there isn t,  she said, coolly. "I ve my sea legs already.    You see, there is nothing on land to judge my direction by and the compass is jumping about like a worm on a griddle; and even knowing the direction, there is no telling how far we are out of our course. The only thing is to keep her head on and try to hold her at a speed even with the wind  and while we re losing time the change of the wind s direction may take us down to Pittsburg or up to Ottawa.    Then we wrouldn t make it, would we     she asked, her voice, which had been nerv- ous with the exaltation of the experience, changing to concern. Ten minutes, fifteen minutes, a half hour elapsed and still they rode the tempest com- fortably, if in mad impatience. The Falcon had ceased rocking, now that she had a steady element to deal with. They were as solid as a light house with a gale whist- ling by.   It s a thing we ve got to master yet, knowing your position in a storm. It makes you understand Erickson and Columbus, who worked their way with primitive in- struments across unknown seas,  he re- marked at length, adding, with a glance at the luminous face of the little clock:  Good heavens  It s 4.20 and the Conti- nent is just due at Erie  His words might have had magic in them from the transformation that followed. But the power lay with the heat of the morning sun. Suddenly as it had risen, the wind fell. As his eyes, trained to keen aerial observation, got their first glimpse of earth, he shouted:   What luck  We ve kept our position perfectly   With the passing of the mist they saw houses, fences, and fields silvered with dew. Along one of the four steel ribbons 0.1 the shore of Lake Erie, like a quadruple hem on the dark flounce of a shimmering satin skirt, they identified a rushing streak which had just roared through the town.  The Continent Limited, by the brassy end of its observation car   he said.   It will be a race   she cried.  A race in the air with the fastest train in the country      Oh, no   lie answered.

Mean- while, his companion had grown silent and thoughtful. In place of the elation he had looked for, the mercury of her nature was developing an unexpected mood.   As I remember, there is an open space just in front of the station where we can land,  he observed.   You ll have a good quarter of an hour to wait.   A good quarter of an hour   she re- peated , with avidity. Iler gloom departed as swiftly as it had come.  Splendid  A whole fifteen minutes honestly    Yes,  he answ-ered, curiously.   Then,  she announced,   we could drop on the lawn before Joe starts to meet me. Will you   It s his father s house on Euclid Avenue, and there is a big yard, with no trees.  And this after her journey for purposes of deception  He concluded that she was as volatile as the air currents.   Frankly, you amaze me   he confessed.   Don t you see that is telling him that you weren t on the Continent that it s inviting him to ask questions about why you failed to catch it and why you are here on the Falcon  "   Of course it is,  she rejoined.   Oh, how am I to explain   It seems so unrea- sonable and it s so real and logical to me  I thought my discoveries were over and I ve found I had only just begun exploring. This night, this ride they ve set so many things going in my mind  Selfishness is an awful thing, isn t it  It would keep that mine of gold by cunning, deceit any way. And did ever the light of morning suddenly make everything clear to you   Everything is to me now. Let Joe ask questions. If he doesn t, I m going to confess to him.    Others would tell, anyway, that s true,  Rodd assented easily, but watching her face critically for the effect of his words.   I don t care about that,  she answered.  He ll hear everything   about how I was going up to Westchester everything  That s the only right basis to begin on. Otherwise, I d I d feel I d not been fair and we d better not begin at all.  He felt the gratification of prophecy as Her Compelling Eyes he recalled that one of the things he had hrst noticed about her eyes, lying deep like a permanent tire under all their power of expression, was their honesty. Now they radiated the truth and hope of her inmost being.  Then, if you d gut that far in your thoughts yesterday afternoon you wouldn t have come with me,  Rodd observed.  Yes, I would I hope that I would,  she answered.   I am glad I did. Think of being all night in that hotel when my thoughts were in Cleveland  It was a big, bold, good thing to do in reparation. It was going to him with my confession just as fast as I could.  Rodd, too, had made a disrovcry one in womanly possibilities. Tie had en- joyed an honor in having her for a pas sengcr which made the triumph of having beaten the Continent Limited, now a speck on the rails far in the rear, a negligible incident.   Do you do you think when he hears everything that lie will will cross that line   she asked, a touch of plaintive ap- peal in her voice.   We shall soon know,  he answered. They were already on the outskirts of Cleveland. Rodd slowed clown to the speed of a suburban trolley car. As they skimmed the house tops they saw delivery wagons with milk, rolls, and newspapers for the city breakfast table coursing the almost de- serted streets. The full marc h of the day s activities had not yet begun. With the Fal- con hovering over Euclid Avenue, the girl indicated a man descending the steps of a house, evidently bent toward an automobile on the drive. He rubbed his eyes at sight of the visitation from the air which was about to light at his feet.   Now, I m off as soon as you step down,  Rodd said.     h, please   she answered.   You must meet him.   I'll wait around for a time and you signal me if it s all right. It s no place for a third person,  said Rodd.  How can I ever   she began. He had a glance of gratitude more elo- quent than any set phrase, in which beamed as a secondary light her appreciation of his final act of considerateness, and she took his outstretched fingers in a quick pressure before she sprang lightly to earth and he saw her exquisite figure over his shoulder, as the Falcon took wing, sweeping forward in the culminating crisis of the resolution which had been born at 4.50 the previous afternoon.  After he looks in those eyes and hears her story,  Rodd thought,   Joe is a chump if heeverisable tolocate that rigid meridian of his again.  lie soared in circles, watching the girl standing opposite the man. Once, as he dipped, he could see her face clearly trans- fused with the emotion of her confession. Then he had to swing a plane to keep the Falcon's trim in her slow orbit. When he looked down after that, both were waving their handkerchiefs frantically. lie waved his own in answer. The man made violent motions of one conveying food to his mouth as a pantomimic substitute for an invitation to breakfast.  That would be intruding. Resides, the recollection is perfect as it is,  Rodd thought and flew away. OLD L o X DON liv Frederic C.

Every parish, every tliuri h, every monument, almost every street, has its an tiquarian. Bui the strangest antiquity of all London is   The Mavnr and Common alty and Citizens of the City of London.  This is the legal title of the old   lity. I know of no place in Lurope, and no institution, whether religious, political, or social, where the tentacles of the past cling as tenaciously to the present as they do around the little patch of ground, but tine mile square, which nestles about the Mansion House and the Bank of Kngland. This is London, legal London, historical I .ondon, the London of the antiquarian and the modern Imam irr. It is not the Lon- don whit h appears upon the map. with its population of 7,000.000 souls, and its area of 6q3 square miles Metropolitan London requires 202 county, boroogh, urban, and rural councils, boards of guardians, and parish councils, besides the Parliament of the empire, to govern it. These agencies combined .- pend nearlySijo.000,000a year, about the budget of Greater New York. But the city of London proper, which lies in the heart of Greater London, has a li ing population   1 but sS, oo by night, although 300,000 people do business there by day, while all of the currents of Krit- isli life pass through its portals. Here is the soul of the empire, with its population of 400.000,000, and its area of 11,400,000 square miles, or more than one fifth of the population and area nf the globe. Here, too, i; the heart of fhe trade, commerce, and financial transactions of the world, f rom this little spot " tin nation of shopkeepers  semis forth its administrators and its sol-  1   tliers, its men-of-war and its merchant ma- rine to every nook and cranny of the globe, at the command of Lombard, Gracechurch, Threadneedle, and I- enchurch Streets and Bartholomew Lane. It was at the behest of the city that Clive and Warren Hastings subjugated India, that the opium trade was imposed tin China, that Gordon went to his death in Khartoum, and the dower of Eng- land went to South Africa. Out from this pulmonary centre the commercial life of Christendom radiates. London is the counter of the world. And the old City Corporation, with its banks, its brokers, its offices and machinery for ex- changing the products of India with Africa, and of China with America, is the clearing- house of us all. England is the only great nation which opens its doors to the trade of the world, unhampered and unrestrained by taxes, tariffs, imposts, or octroi. White, black, yellow, and red. the followers of Christ, of Buddha, of Mohammed and Con- fucius, all send their wares, in consequence, I 1 the ports which invite them. For trade hates barriers. It will go around the world to avoid a tariff wall. And because of this fact Great Britain is the counter across which the wealth of the world is ex- changed. Here the products of every clime are freely swapped. The exports of Amer- ica come to the ports of England, to be reshipped in turn to the ports of South America, Africa, and Asia. The products of the Orient take the same course, and for the same reason. It is not that England has subsidized her mien ham marine. It is not that trade follows the flag. It is the freedom with which men trade across an open coimter that has given Great Brit- ain supremacy of the seas. It is this that has built up her cotton and her woollen trade, her cutlery, and tool industries. It is this that has given her wares a welcome entry into every port. For no j eople are so ignorant that they do not prefer to trade with those who trade with them. And no shipping can be profitable where bottoms Entering llie city: LuJgalc Hill tu St I'nul's from Fleet Street arc empty one way. There can never be any commerce, and there never has been any commerce, where all     the profits arc made by one party. London is the centre of the commercial world, just as were Genoa, Amsterdam, and Antwerp before her, bccausc the people of the earth freely distribute their wares from English ports. The shippingof the I nited Kingdom equals two-thirds of that of the entire world. It Vol. X LVII. 5 amounts to iq,7 4,7 .S gross tons. At one time llie United States was a close com- petitor. But protection closed our gates lo other people, and mediaeval navigation laws compelled our ship owners lo place their vessels under foreign registry. New York would be the clearing house of the world were her ports free from the barriers of a prohibitive tariff. Nothing could then prevent the centre of civilization  ii l.ivrrptMil Slrrct st.ifum, ai ilir ea tcni limit  hr city again shifting to the west, as it has done repeatedly before. The law of commercial gravity would make this inevitable. And just as London is the centre of the financial world, so Lombard Street, which flanks the Mansion House of the Lord Mayor, is the centre   f financial London. Into Lombard Street flows annually' the $4 50.000,000 which England receives as interest on her foreign investments. 1 lore the loans of the United Kingdom, as well as nf her colonies, are floated. Here the Bank of England controls the rate of dis- count, and aids in the maintenance of the nation's credit in times of stress. Here the trade balances of America, Europe, Asia, and Africa are settled by the transfer of bal- ances upon the books of the banks. Lom- bard Street pays the bills of the billion and a half people of the world with about Old London 43 the same ease that the clearing-house of ;in inland city clears the checks of its local customers. The best approach to the ancient city of London is through the Strand and Fleet Street. Its boundaries begin at Temple Bar by the Courts of Justice. Ahead rises St. Paul s Cathedral, in its command- ing dignity. Through this aorta the life of London surges all day long to the heart of the city, whose beginnings run back to the days of the Danes and early English, and whose political forms and privileges arc- older than the claims of the present reign- ing house of England. For the charter of the city of London is a mediaeval survival. It is claimed to be older than the Nor- man conquest. The Commonwealth and the Restoration,the Revolution and the Re- form Acts, have passed over it, democracy and socialism have made their appear ance, but  The Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens of the City of London  re- mains unchanged. Here alone, the mer chant guilds, or livery companies, once universal and all-powerful in the cities of Europe, retain their ancient privileges. Here alone they linger on, much as the wedding journey remains, a survival of the days when the bride was stolen from a hos- tile tribe, and carried away by her savage suitor to her new home. The city of Lon- don is still governed by the guilds, or livery companies. They choose the Lord Mayor, the sheriffs, and the aldermen. For all practical purposes the guilds are the city of London. It is impossible lo tell where the one begins or the other ends. It i.-  as though there existed in and around Wall Street an old Dutch city wholly detached from Greater New York and governed, not by the people, but b  the brokers, the bankers, the insurance companies, and the shipping houses who do business in that region. From the thirteenth to the eighteenth centuries practically all of the cities of Europe were in the hands of the rich mer- chants, who ruled and in turn were ruled by the trading guilds. These companies were closed corporations. They admitted members much as did the religious orders. They enjoyed a closed shop. They fixed the hours of labor, wages, and output. They enjoyed virtual monopolies in their respective trades. It was they who erected Vol. XLVII. 6 the splendid halls which one finds in Brus- sels, 13ruges, Bremen, and the old free cities of the Continent. The guilds of London still have the legal right to exclude any one but their own members from doing busi- ness in the city, but they 'lo not exercise the right. The only surviving function of a once universal trade monopoly is the affixing of the hall-mark to silver by the goldsmiths, and the stamping of herring by the fishmongers. In all of the cities of Europe the powers of the guilds have been taken away. Their property has been devoted lo public uses. The guilds of the city of London, however, still manage the city, and in point of wealth, and possibly influence, are more powerful than in mediaeval times. They refuse to be abolished, refuse to permit the property, which belongs in reality to Greater Lon- don, to be devoted to public uses. Cer- tainly no other city in the United Kingdom would make answer to Parliament as did the City Corporation when under investiga- tion in 1893. In an elaborate brief, the city asserted, in effect, that it was above Parlia- ment. It said:   The city enjoys privileges and franchises which cm neither be lost by forfeiture nor voluntarily surrendered. Throughout the early history of the city and its charters, there is the amplest evidence that for most, if not for all, of these, and for the greater part of the rights and privil eges enjoyed by the citizens, due and full pecuniary compensation has been given.  Here is an ini peri ton in imperio, a sov- ereignly within a sovereignty, all resting 011 purchase; the right of a freedman lo his hard bought liberty from his master. The city paid for these privileges, much as, early in the nineteenth century, the nations of F.urope paid tribute to the Deyof Algiers, on condition that he would keep his hand off from their commerce. Every effort of Parliament to merge the corporation into the metropolis, or reform its charter, has failed. When the medieval municipal charters of all the other cities of England were abolished in rS.30, London was left untouched. It is more powerful than the Liberal party when in power, and the Con- servative party does not care to interfere with it. Only once has the nation been able to ascertain what property the guilds owned, how the income was spent, or any- thing about their business. That was in Tooley Stieet und St Oluvc's Church, Southwark. j S  4- since that time both the city ami the guilds have been immune from attack. The city of London is hounded on the east bv Liverpool Street station and Tower Bridge;   n the south l v the Thames; on the west by the Royal Courts of Justice and the city of Westminster; and on the north by the High Holborn and Charter- 44 house Street. Only the Christian Church is contemporary with its origin. It still preserves its ancient lares and penates.  jog and Magog, which were carried for centuries at the head of the Lord Mayor s procession, and which now preside over the banquet chamber of the Guildhall.

He is obliged to spend from $75,000 to S100.000 a year, however, in maintaining the ollue. So he pays lor his whistle. However, on the termination of liis vear he is almost always elevated to a baroneli v. In addition he has the Man- sion llotise in which to live, a palatial resi- lience which faces the Bank ot England, the Stock Exchange, and Lombard Street, lie looks out on the busiest and noisiest spot in llie world by day, and into almost sepuli hral silence by night Eor a mere handful of people sleep in the city, though more than a million pass through the city eai h day. All this splendor and quasi royalty is somew hat out of harmony with the official roster of the Lord Mayors and the Board of Aldermen from which they are chosen. It is badlv in accord with the con tern  it of the English nation lor trade and trades- men. Were a critical Englishman to visit America and say that the mayors and al- dermen of New York were tailors, mer cers. drapers, apothec aries, barbers, black- smiths, cooks, and fishmongers, and gar deners, and had been sue h for centuries, I fancy the average Englishman would think rathere on Iempluously of a government that did not rise above the shopkeeper or the laborer  nr :ts oliicial class.   el such a statement would be literal I y true of the city ol London, one ot the smallest, the most anc ient, and probably the richest of the world's municipalities.   'nly these men do not work al their trade. They are only titular apothecaries, fishmongers, drapers, etc. Tliev belong to Some one of the guilds which represent these c rails or trades. In reality they are great men hants. bankers, men of leisure, and members of the gentry. The king is a liveryman. So was General Grant. The present mayor. Sir George Wvatt Trus- c oil. is a stationer. I lis predecessor w as a haberdasher. Most nf the twentv-six al- dermen who are chosen bv the S.000 liv- erymen dwell in Mayfair, Regent Park w ay. W hitehall, and out along the Thames. And of these twenty six aldermen, eighteen are knights. But they are all   v officii  mer- chant tailors, goldsmiths, spec tac le makers, shipwrights, cullers, turners, grocers, etc., and serve the city by virtue of this fact. Not more than two or three of them even 'I'm.II in lIn.- . ii  Iiii It 111' v i'1'ii I   'i 1111     :ip lln-   1111111 -111 i  1 I   ml' ii i in I I i ii   m tv r   'ii ' '  i i n iii 11' . 111.111 .i 1111 ' 11 y - ' - I ill- .

The ri  her guild-. own .-j lemIi  1 halls hidden away in the heart "I the   itv Many "f tliex- halls are verv old, although most of the an  ient palaces were destroyed bv the great tire of London. Those wIii  h re- main ami lllose u hi  h have been ere  ted during the past   enUiry indi  ate the wealth anil greatness of the guilds, and the powers which they en joyed in an earlier   lay. The most splendid halls are those of the gold- smiths, drapers, fishmongers, mercers, .sad- dlers, men ham tailors, and samplers. I hey are tilled with gold and silver plate ol great value, as well as with line paintings and hangings. In the olden days, before the na- tional 1 redit was established, needy sover- eigns were in the habit of borrowing this plate as collateral for some loan or other. To-dav it is used on state occasions, when some great ban  Uet is given. The halls would make splendid social clubs, but thev are limited to ceremonial occasions, w hen a reception, ball, or dinner is given to the members and their families. In addi- tion. some   i the guilds afford substantial death benefits to their members. This is all that remains of the ancient functions of the livery companies. The services which they perform are n  w mainly charitable, culinary, and ceremonial. Then there i-i politi  al preferment. Men in Fngland take great pride in public office, even though it be but service on a board of guardians ul the poor. For the traditions of this little country all cluster about service in some form or other, whether it be in the -t:tlc-. in the army, or in the Church. Pub- lii service is a hall-mark of distinction, and it is oiilv through membership in a guild that a man may become Lord Mayor, or   ne of the twenty-six aldermen of the city. As a matter ot la  t. almost allot  the mem- bers ot the com moil council are also livery- men. the ordinary citizen being practically excluded from a vo n e in his local affairs. Nowhere in the world does the glamour ot age count for as mm Ii as in Fngland, and nowhere is it more jealously guarded than in the corporation of London. This ot itself is suffn ient t   explain the desire of men t   preserve these ancient institutions. But   ri li  s 11 'i a few have hinted that other reasons explain the ten.uitv with which the- liven companies light for their exist- ence. For the guilds are very rich nobody knows how rich they really are. They own landed estates in the   itv, in Hammer- smith, I sx-x, Kent, and Surrey: in Ireland, and Wales in tact, all over the l. nited Kingdom Their funds are invested in consols and other securities. The twelve great companies own the Lister I .states in Ireland. Muih ot this property came by gin or 1  e  iiesi tor public c harities, and the critics insist that the revenue should all be l.om   n Central Markets Smithtield. used for public purposes. But the guilds invest their funds and use their revenues as they will. They account to nobody but themselves. A royal commission was ap- pointed by Mr. Gladstone in to in- vestigate the companies. The commission included such men as the Duke of Bedford, llie F.arl of Derby, Viscount Sherbrooke, and the Lord Chief Justice of England. Certainly these men were not dangerous radicals. Vet the commissioners declared that the funds of the guilds were public 49 50 Old London property, and urged the immediate inter vention of Parliament to prevent their ali- enation and to assure their use for public purposes. The report stated that 1,500 self- appointed committees of the guilds took fees from the estates amounting to 8200,000 a year. In addition they spent  500,000 a year in banquets, while S750.000 was paid for balls and the expenses of the manage- ment. It cost at least 81,500,000 to ad- minister an income of  4,000,000 derived from trust funds. The estates of theseventy- four guilds were estimated to be worth $75,000,000. The Commission said they would be worth Sroo,000,000 by  005. But the recommendations of the parlia- mentary commission came to naught; the City Corporation was so powerful in Par- liament that nothing was ever done. Even to-day the management of the affairs of the livery companies is conducted in secret by committees which nominate themselves and their successors, and acknowledge re sponsibility to no one. The guilds, it is true, expend substan- tial sums for charity. About Si,000,000 is used for purposes specified in the trusts created by the donors. The drapers sup- port the Crystal Palace; the ' have given largely to the University of London. Rad clifle Library at    xford has received large donations from the livery Companies. Pro- fessorships are maintained in various in- stitutions, and substantial contributions are made to technical education. Gresham College is maintained by the corporation of London, as arc many other charities for the poor, for orphans, and the blind. The city itself is also tremendously rich. In addition to such property as a munic- ipality usually owns, the city is a large landlord. It owns one tenth of the real estate within its limits. It rents its build- ings just as does a private owner. It con- trols the Irish Ulster estates, which were acquired in 1609, during the reign of James the First, although the rents and revenues are paid to the livery companies in propor- tion to the investment made by them at the time the estates were acquired. The city also owns Epping Forest, a great stretch of woodland, twelve miles long, east of Lon- don, acquired at a cost of Si,500,000. It also owns the celebrated Burnham beeches, and has the right of patronage of many city churches. It further owns one of the largest and most beautiful cemeterics in or around London. The corporation lias also a monopoly of the market rights of the city of London. By the terms of a contract entered into with Henry HI. it was agreed that no one else should ever be given any market rights within seven miles of the city. And Parlia- ment has protected this ancient monopoly, even though the needs of seven million in- habitants of London have been sacrificed in consequence. The London County Coun- cil has never been able to secure the right to open a market within its jurisdiction, and only in one instance, if it be an in- stance, has this monopoly been invaded. In 1552 Charles II granted to the Earl of Bedford permission to establish a market in the old fields of the Convent of West- minster, near by the fields known as Seven Dials, or Long Acre. This is now the Cov- ent Garden Market owned by the Duke of Bedford. By virtue of this ancient grant, the duke still levies tribute on the metrop- olis of the United Kingdom. No huck- ster, market gardener, costermonger, or child with a basket of  lowers may offer his produce about the market, or upon the streets, without the consent of the duke, and upon such terms as his agent exacts. For the market privilege is not limited to the site of the market itself, for by the terms of the original grant made.it is true, nearly four centuries ago. no other market may be established within seven miles of Cov- ent Garden. Neither the London County Council, the burougli councils, nor any other individual or corporation may open a mar- ket in Greater London, so sacred is this ancient grant. No one knows the amount of the tribute collected through this mo- nopoly, but it is colossal. Along with the rights of the City Corporation, the market profits ijre estimated to be over a million dollars. It costs twelve centsaday to stand a basket of  lowers upon the streets within the confines of the market radius, and three times this sum to back a cart against the curb. The stalls within the market are very expensive, for all of the south of Eng- land competes for them, while all London comes here to buy its vegetables, fruits, and flowers. Dynasties change and gen- erations come and go, but grants, gifts and contracts, with no higher sanction than the thoughtless whim of a king to a dissolute The Houses of Parliament. favorite, remain immune from alteration or attack, so sacred is the name of age in the United Kingdom. The markets of the City Corporation alone are capitalized at Si 7,500,000. They include Billingsgate, the great fish market fronting on the Thames below London Bridge, where the language is as refined as the odors which emanate from it. The Metropolitan Cattle Market of the city is said to be the largest cattle market in the world. Here more than 4,000.000 cattle arc sold even' year. Other markets arc also maintained under grants which the city ob- tained centuries ago for the sale of hay, grain, provisions, and vegetables. The rev- enues of the dty from these markets, as well as from the real estate which it owns, amount to over $4,000,000 a year. The city of London is but one of the 5  The Thames Basin, toward IViwer Bridge; Billingsgate Market on the left. many political, educational, religious, and social institutions which linger on in Eng- land, untouched by the progress of democ- racy. They are protected by that venera- tion for the past that characterizes the country. The wealth of the guilds and of the city is, for the most part, expended in inconsequential charities. The great met- ropolis, with its millions of poor, its awful tenements, its ignorance and squalor, needs schools and hospitals and breathing places the worst way. And were the Si00.000,000 of trust funds devoted to some big useful purpose, a substantial decrease could be made in the misery of the city. But inertia and privilege arc strong in Great Britain, and nowhere arc they stronger than in the city itself. Its power radiates into Parlia- ment and the Church, and effectively pre- vents any interference with its abuses. it is this veneration for the past that distinguishes England from all of the countries of western Europe. France, Ger- many, even Italy, have dared to use the knife on feudalism. They destroyed the system by a surgical operation. In Eng- land alone, however, the feudal system, with ils age, its caste, its classes, its economic re- lation of lord and vassal, remains in its es- sential features the framework of society. 52 T IIOS Ii I I I A I W A I T By Mary Roberts. Rineharl    the last call of the guard died away, Phillips roused him- self from the cam pi; hair where lie had been dozing, his head against the upright of the tent, and looked guilt- ily down the alley of gray canvas, with its darker shadows, horizontal, motionless. The Wardmastcr yawned; then lie got up, with his hands to his forehead, liis head was throbbing, and the ground under his feet wavered so that he had to w ind his arm around the upright for support. Somewhere back in the ward there began the insistent tattoo of a tin cup on the side of a cot. Phillips prodded with his foot a figure in a blanket at his feet.     let up, Simpson,  he said. "I'm all in. What s the matter with you   W ake up   The blanket twisted, st retched, and ra ised itself by degrees. "What is it:1 ' Simpson inquired drowsi- ly, showing a strong inclination to fold up on the ground again. The tin cup began again, louder.

With the slender glass tube in his hand, however, the Wardmastcr lu-sitated then he gave it back. ' What s the use   he said listlessly. " I d get a little more quinine to morrow   that s all.

"  ust when I think I ve got it, it jumps, damn it.  He rolled himself in the gra  blanket and flopped down again, but he did not go to sleep at once. After a couple of uneasy turns he raised himself on his elbow and Vol.. X I   II. ; looked along the three tents which formed the long tu nnel-like    ard.

The W ardmastcr dozed again. He was roused by something rubbing against his foot. To his fever-stirred brain the in- truder loomed large and menacing, but it resolved itsell into a c at, as lean, as wretch cd as himself. He got up with difficulty, and pouring some milk out of a pitcher into a cup, set it on the gr  und " I warn you, Thomas," he -aid gravely,   the bacillus cot i lommitnis is tloating around: that milk's probably full of il.

A little air drilled along the ground, lifting the llaps of the tents, and the -harp shadow- bciame hazv with the night mist. 'I he cat slept, gorged, at Phillips's feet, undisturbed by the call of the guard " Post number one: one o'clock." "Post number two; one o'clock, and all's well." Phillips was not asleep, lie slid his fin- ger along his w rist and smiled grimly a  he felt the artery leap under it Then, partly because he was suffocating, partly because he had got in the habit of doing it, lie went out into the night and stood for a moment staring at a grotipof tentsthat loomed misty w hite al ove the ground fog. And in his face  here was something not plea -ant to see. W hen he went back, a man was sitting on the side of the nearest cot. He was test- ing  il- strength, putting his feet down and raising himself an inch or two with his 5-i Those That Wait hands. Evidently he was satisfied, for he called Phillips over.   Let me get up in that chair, Sergeant,  he pleaded in a whisper.  I can t sleep, and I can kick Simpson if he s needed. You take this bed: you d better lie down before you fall down.  Without protest Phillips dropped on the cot and stretched himself luxuriously. The convalescent wrapped his blanket around his knees and put his feet on the end of the bed.  Going to sleep   he asked cautiously.  No.    Look here, Phillips you ll have to start home to-morrow if you re going at all. I ve been watching you, and you re sick. I ll be blamed if I think it s malaria either.    Typhoid,  Phillips said laconically.  Furlough come yet    No.   What s the matter,  asked the other man.   I thought aren t you going to get it   Phillips clenchcd his hands under the blanket.   The application never went in,  he said quietly.   I asked the clerk about it, and  he said he tore it up, under orders, and threw it away.  The man in the chair sat upright.   Why, it s murder  That s what it is.  He bit his lip over the slip, but the other man did not notice. He was arguing with himself.  We re short of men, Collins,  he was saying.   There s nobody to put here and of course he couldn t know. It may comc yet.   Like hell it may,  Collins muttered.  As for the Major not knowing, it s his business to know. Do you live with your folks  Want me to write to them    With my mother. No. No use alarm- ing her.    Father dead     No.  There was a note of finality that stopped further questioning, and Collins desisted. Phillips lay there for a thousand years, looking up at the streaked canvas over his head, seeing strange processions of people he had known, watching the tent roof re- cede miles away, and then come back and drop on his face and try lo smother him. And one of the professors from his medical college came again and again, and sat on the foot of the cot and asked him the rise and fall and tributaries of the ilio-hypogas- tric nerve. When a century had passed, he wakened suddenly and sat up. The floor slipped back as he put his feet down, but once erect he could walk, treading gingerly so as not to arouse the hammering devils in his head.   How long was I asleep     he demanded irritably.  Twenty minutes,  Collins said.  Say, the boy that came yesterday first Wiscon- sin is pretty bad. Temperature, one- naught-six. Simpson says are you going to send for Shields    No good. Shields is laid up.   Try for the Major then.  But Phillips turned on him bitterly.   We ll let the Major sleep,  he snarled. He got a basin of cold water, and sponged the sick boy carefully. Over and over, with long, downward strokes, on his knees, be- cause he couldn t stoop, he worked away, losing count of time, but always wetting the sponge and keeping on. Once or twice he squeezed it over his own head and the water ran down in little trickles of coolness under his shirt. When he finished, the boy was sleeping, and Phillips stumbled back to the cot. Collins was sitting there, hold- ing the cat on his knee.  Jove,  he said,  I know what hell s like now it s not furnace-hot and dry: it s hot and damp and muggy. How do you feel      Rotten,  Phillips said wearily.   You said a funny tiling in your sleep,  Collins persisted, watching him.   You got up on your elbow and looked straight at me, and you said,  All my life 1 have been taught to look up to you: that you were a great man. And they lied    Phillips did not answer. He lay back on the cot and closed his eyes. And once again the figures crowded around. It was Johnson, of the Ambulance Corps, who found him the next day, refus- ing to be undressed, and raving of a fur- lough that had torn itself into scraps. And when Major Armitage, on hospital inspec- tion that day, came around, the sick man buried his face in his pillow and babbled. Johnson undressed him, bathed him, and sat by him for a while, cursing the kitchen i Those That Wait 55 which sent in soup filled with vegetables, and straining through a towel the little that Phillips would take.   He s finished himself, all right.  Simp- son whimpered.  Nosleep -rottengrub  and workin  twenty-four hours a day. And it ain t only that.  He came close to John- son and bent over.  Have you noticed about Armitage   he asked.  Wasn t he talkin  about him   He was all last night. Once he thought I was the Major, and he said,  You ve done worse than you knew. You ve killed the man I thought you were.    Delirium,  Johnson scoffed.  What kind of sense does that make    There s something you and I don t know, Lieutenant,  Simpson persisted.  One night, a couple of weeks ago, when he looked pretty bad, I coaxed him to go out and walk around. When he didn t come back, I found him outside the Major s tent, in the shadow, with his arms folded, and a queer look in his face. I touched him twice before he knew I was there. It s been a queer business.    Has the Major noticed   Does he know him      Not that I know of. But for that matter, his own mother wouldn t rccognize him.  A week later Johnson sought and found Captain Armour, the Surgeon. He was washing in a tin basin outside his tent, throwing the cold water over his bald head and puffing like a porpoise.  The next time it rains,  he was grum- bling,   I am going to have a shower bath, if I smash every regulation on the slate. The idea of a two-hundred-pound man keeping clean on a pint of water ter in did Phillips  What about Phillips    He s very bad, sir,  Johnson replied.  I wish you could come over to-night and look at him. He s weak, and wearing him- self out with delirium.   He s a good boy, Phillips is,  the Surgeon spoke through his towel.  I ll come over and bring Major Armitage if I can get him.  Through the long days Phillips had lain on the end cot; when ice was plentiful sometimes a cup of small pieces was put on the ground beside him, and he learned to reach down and fumble for it. The coolness and moisture helped his crusted tongue and cracked lips. And twice a day somebody went over him with a sponge and cold water, and for ten glorious minutes lie was rested, moist, sane. Then the fever devils came again, and things crawled around him, and the cot sometimes floated high in the air, and again was so elose to the ground that he smelled the damp earth, like an open grave. And always he held to a bit of worthless paper that Johnson had got from head- quarters, which said that one Alden Phillips was entitled to ten days  furlough, and was useless now, of course, seeing that he was being given a furlough that stretched into eternity. Captain Armour came that night and sat on the foot of the bed, and swore at the heat and the smell in the ward. And then he took a long breath and said that Phillips had been in his clinic at Philadelphia for a year, and it was too bad, too bad. After a while lie scribbled a line, and sent it to Major Armitage, in charge of the field hospital, and then he sat and waited, patting Phillips s hand now and then, and muttering under his breath.  A little bit of nursing,  he snarled,  a woman to fuss over them and make them comfortable, that s what they need here: it s the men that have never seen a battle that are dying in this war.  The heat was terrible. A lantern hung above the head of the cot, leaving Phillips s face in shadow and throwing out clear and distinct, the undress of the Surgeon. He had taken off his coat, showing a broken pair of suspenders and a flannel shirt open and turned in almost to the waist over his hairy chest. All through the ward was a hustle of preparing for the night. The convales- cents were shaking crumbs off thcii blan- kets and punching pillows for their help- less comrades: milk and water were being put around: Simpson, who was a hostler by nature as well as training, was tying down a delirious Texan much as he would a refractory horse, and in a far corner a colored soldier was singing under his breath. Some of the men took up the song, humming it with shaky, unpractised voices. There was an instant silence when Ma- jor Armitage came in. The privates sa- luted and slunk to their cots the Surgeon started to fasten his shirt and thought Those That W ait belter of it. Only the Song went on, low, deep, fervent.   Lead, kindly Light, iimid lit' metre  ing glo-o-  t  Lead Thun me on. " . . . the men sang s   flly. The Major nodded i   the Surgeon, and stood lor a moment looking down at the prostrate bov.  'Whai's his name.-'  he asked. "Phillips: Ambulance Corps, Fourth Pennsylvania.  "Sent word to his home " curtly. "To his mother- yesterday, sir,  John- son replied.   It's Iowa,  the Surgeon supplemented. "She won t get here for three days. The boy s been sii k lor two weeks. I don't know why he didn t gel away from this plague spot while he could.  Simpson brought a chair and Major Armitagc sat down beside the cot. lie took the galloping pulse, and being a careful man, he took it for two minutes instead of one.    ith the touch ol his cool hands the muttering ceased; Phillips, who had been staring at the lent roof, suddenly turned his head and looked .it Armitage; then lie- jerked his hand away. "You   lie said thickly, for his longue u as hard and dry. " Who Sent for you     The Major looked at the Surgeon. "There's no delirium there, Doctor.  he said " Whai's he gelling "  " Nothing that he ought to have," t he Sur- geon grumbled. "I tell vou, Major   But the sii k man was suddenly laboring under violent excitement.

Whv, it s a joke: why don t you laugh   The other faces always grin  Why don't you    The Major tried to speak, but no words came. A couple of privates stopped to listen and moved on, warned by a glare from the Surgeon. " I read- everything I could find about you; I ordered my life as I thought would please you  And when the war came, and you went, I I went too, like a little puppy trailing at your heels. I couldn't stay at home any more than you could  It - was in the blood. Why don t you laugh     The Major got up suddenly and stared down at the boy; then with shaking lingers he tried to lake the lantern from its hook. F rom the far corner of the ward the droning song floated down to them, plaintive, ap- pealing :   77 r night is thirl:. und I am far  rum ho-ome, Li 'id I hoit nit  on  " With the lantern in his hand, the Major hesitated. Then he turned it full on the boy s face, with its sunken, tortured eyes. The boy's strength was going. He was swaying on his bony elbow; then he dropped back and lay quiet. When he moved again it was to say that he could make better soup than that out of an old shoe, and he pushed away an imaginary bowl. After a while, he seemed to sleep, only his lingers picked, picked at the blanket. The Surgeon looked into the Major's face, and from there lo the gaping ears oi the ward, the smell, the noise, the moist heat that sapped the soul.  'Get the cot out into the air,  he said, and when it had been done, he took the Major s arm and led him, stumbling, to where it had been put on the grass in the cool night, with only a candle on a box for light. It threw into relief, above the blan- ket, Phillips s impassive white face,and the Major s suddenly aged one. From the foot of the c ot the Surgeon gave medicine now and then, and could think of no comfort  the body being his province, not the soul. From far off across the camp there rose a distant hubbub of noise. J.t spread, grew, came close and resolved itself into Those That Wait the clamor of forty thousand throats. Like waves breaking on the sand tho sound ap- proached, rcccdcd, crept on again. It beat against the canvas walls of the hospital, and echoed back from the hills. The camp was suddenly alive; torches, candles, lan- terns flashed up, a twisting, leaping mass of lights, and far across the camp a band was playing   Dixie.  Near by a South Carolina regiment had taken up the noise.  Yi-i-i-i,  they rasped the night with the old rebel yell of triumph. Simpson ran out to the nearest regiment and Collided with an ofheer, wli   was too excited to damn him. "I m from the hospital, Lieutenant.  he panted.   What what's happened     .Spanish licet sunk bv Sampson at San- tiago,  the Lieutenant called back over hi  shoulder. A Missouri regiment had formed line and was marching noisily through the camp, their lines growing constantly amid the throb of the drums and the cheers of the men. It was a riot of surcharged emotion, of unselfish pride in a victory in which they had had no part, in a war which spelled for them only inglorious hardship, this outburst in the Camp of Those Left behind. Somewhere, far off, the Brigadier-  lener- al was making a speech, incoherent, throb- bing, jovous. II - wore his uniform trou- sers and a pajama coat, and stood on the top of a barrel. Simpson could not wait to hear. He scuttled bac k to the hospital, and feeble cheers followed his announce- ment, made in a voice which cracked with the tension in his throat. Through it all, the Major, by Phillips's cot, did not move.   nce or twice he looked out at the pandemonium, the relaxed disci- pline of the camp, but he was detached, far away. His mind was back in the days when this gaunt, dying young soldier was a youngster, and he had read him  The Man Without a Country,  and had had lo stop, with a lump in his own throat, w hile the boy had cried the hot tears of child- hood. It was long ago, and now the boy was a soldier and dying. Aft .-r a while the Surgeon came back and took up his vigil on the end of the cot.  Thank the Good One above,  he said huskily, "we ve licked those damned Span- iards into a cocked hat.  The boy had stopped babbling and slept: the Major raised his head. It was evident that the doctor s voice had not penetrated to him, back in the years that were gone.  When was his mother sent for     Yesterday." "She cannot get here.  he said simplv, and fell bat k into lu  old position, his   Inn on his hands. When he looked up again, the noise was subsiding.

Cable    the following pages might c hoose their own time and place they would meet their reader not in the trolley-car or on the suburban train, but in his own home, comfort- ably seated. For in order to justify the eulogistic tone of the descriptions which must presently occupy them their first word must be a conciliatory protest against hurry. One reason we Americans garden so little is that we are so perpetually in haste. The art of gardening is primarily a leisurely and gentle one. And gentility still has some rights.    ur Louisiana Creoles know this, and at times maintain it far beyond the pales of their evergreen gardens.   'Step lively' '  one of them is said to have amazcdly retorted in a New York streetcar, "No. the lady shall imt step livelv. At vo- leisure, mndame, cntrez " In N cw    rleans the i ondm inrs do not crv "Step livelv." Right nr wrong, the cars there are not absolutely democratic,  ieti tility really enjoys in them a certain right tn be treated gently. If democracy could know it' own tyrants it would know that one of them is haste; the haste, the hurry of the crowd; that hurry whose cracking whip makes every one a compulsory sharer in it. The streetcar con dm tnr, poor lad, is not t   blame. The fault i  ours, many of us being in such a scramble to buy dcmotracv at anv price, that, .is if we were belatedly buying railway tickets, we lorget tn wait tnr nur   liange. Now, one nf this tyrant's human fnrms is a man a part of w hose tyranny is tocall him- self a gardener, though lie knows he is not one. and the svmbol nf oppression is nothing more nr less than that germ cue my of good gardening, the lawn-mower. Non, it you know the gardening nf our average American Imme almost anywhere else, would see, yourself, how true this is, -,s were you in New Orleans. But you see it beautifully proved not by the presence but by the absence of the tyranny. The lawn- mower is there, nf course: no one is going ;o propose that the lawn mower anywhere be abolished. It is one of our modem marvels of convenience, a blessed release nf countless human backs from countless hours of crouc hing, sickle-shaped, over the sit k 1 -. It is not the tyrant, but only like so many other instruments of beneficent democratic emancipation, the tyrant's op- portunity. A large part   f its convenience is expedition, and expedition is the easiest tiling in the world to become vulgarized: vulgarized it becomes haste, and haste is the tyrant. Such arguing would sound ab- surdly subtle aimed against the uncloaked, barefaced tyranny of the street-car con- ductor, but the tyranny of the man with the lawn-mower is itself subtle, masked, and requires subtlety to unmask it. See how it operates. For so we shall be the better prepared for a generous appreci- ation of those far Southern gardens whose beauty has singled them out for our admira- tion. We know, of course, that the  for- mal garden,  by reason of its initial and continuing costliness, is, and must remain, the garden of the wealthy few, and that the gardening for the great democracy of our land, the kind that will make the country at large a gardened land, is " inf innal.   free- hand, ungeomet rical gardening. In this sort, on whatever scale, whether of the capitalist   r of the t ottager, the supreme feature is the lawn; the lawn-mower puts this feature within tlie reai h of all. and pretty nearly every American householder has, such as it is, his bit of Eden. But j list in that happy moment the I'empter gets in. The garden s mistress or master is beguiled to believe that one may have a garden without the expense of a gardener and at the same time without any gardening knowledge. The stablc-bov, or The Midwinter  iarden  of New Orleans the man-of-all-work, or the cook, or the t ot tager himself, pushes the lawn mower, ami except for green grass, or   haiigeal ile brow 11 and green, their bit of Eden is naked and is not ashamed.   r if ashamed, certain other beguile meats, other masked democratic tyrannies, entering, reassure it: bliss of publicity, con- tempt of skill, and joy in machinery and machine results. An itinerant ignoramus conies round with his own lawn-mower, the pushing of which he now makes his sole oc- cupation for the green half of the year, and the entire length, breadth, and thii knessof whose wisdom i  a wisdom not of the lawn but only of the lawn-mower; how to keep its bearings oiled and its knives chewing line; and the lawn becomes staringly a fac- tory product. Then tyranny turns the screw again, and in the bliss of publicity and a very reason- able desire to make the small home lot look as large as possible, down come the fences, side and front, and the applauding special- ist of the lawn-mower begs that those ob- structions may never be set up again, be- cause now the householder can have bis lawn mowed so much i itnkir, and he, the pusher, can serve more customers. Were lie truly a gardener he might know some- what of the sweet, sunlit, zephyrous, fra- grant out-door privacies possible to a real garden, and more or less of that benign art which, by skilful shrubbery plantings, can make a small place look much larger as well as incomparably more interesting  than can any mere abolition of fences, and particularly of the street fence.

Now, in Now Orleans, the case is so dif- ferent that really 111  - amateur gardener else- where has not all his rights until he knows why it is so different. Let us, therefore, look into it. In that city one clay the present writer accosted an Irishman who stood, pruning-shears in hand, at the foot of Clay s statue, Lafayette Square. Il was the first week of January, but beside him bloomed abundantly that lovely drooping jasmine called in the I.....ks jiiMiiiiiiini nnt li lontm. " Can you tell me w hat shrub this is i   "That, sor, is the monthly  lorn  Thim as don't know the Imt-hanical nayum some- times call'it the stare jismin, but the but- hauical navuni is the inoiillilv Jlora." J he inquirer spoke his thanks and passet 1 on. but an eager footfall overtook him, his elbow felt a touch, and the high title came a third time: "The but-hanical nayum is the monthly llora." The querist passed on. warmed by a grateful esteem for one w ho. though doubt- less a skilled and frequent tinkler of i he lawn - mower within its just limitations, was no mere dragoon of it but kept a regard for things higher than the bare sod. things of grace in fi irm, in bloom, in ode ir, and worthy of   but- hanical navuni." No mere chauffeur he, of ihe little two-wheeled machine whose   ult. throughout the most ol ourland, has all bui exterminated ornamental gardening. In New Orleans, where it has not con- quered. there i- no crowding for room A ten-story building is called there a sky- scraper. The tow n has not a dozen in all, and not one of that stature is an apartment or tenement house. Having felled her sur- rounding forests of cypress and drained the GO The Midwinter Gardens of New Orleans swamps in which they stood, she has at command an open plain capable of housing a population seven times her present three hundred and fifly thousand, if ever she chooses to build skyward as other cities do. But this explains only why New Orleans might have gardens, not why she chooses to have them, and has them by thousands, when hundreds of other towns that have the room and the lawns choose not to have the shrubberies, vines, and flowers, or have them without arrangement. Why should New Orleans so exceptionally choose to garden, and garden with such exceptional grace  Iler house-lots are extraordinarily numerous in proportion to the numbers of her people, and that is a beginning of the explanation; but it is only a beginning. In- dividually the most of those lots are no roomier than lots elsewhere. Thousands of them, prettily planted, are extremely small. The explanation lies mainly in certain peculiar limitations, already hinted, of her  democracy  That is to say, it lies in her fcnces. Her fcnccs remain, her democracy is different from the Northern variety. The difference may consist only in faults both there and here which we all hope to see democracy itself one day eliminate; but the difference is palpable. The fences mean that the dwellers behind them have never accorded to each other, as neighbors, that liberty-to-take-liberties of which Northern householders and garden holders, after a quarter-century s disappointing experi- ment, are a bit weary. In New Orleans, virtually every home, be it ever so proud or poor, has a fence on each of its four sides. As a result the home is bounded by its fences, not by its doors. Unpleasant necessities these barriers are ad- mitted to be, and those who have them are quite right in not liking them in their bare anatomy. So they clothe them with shrub- beries and vines, and thus on the home s true corporate bound the garden s profile, countenance and character are established in the best way possible; without, that is, any impulse toward embellishment insu- lated from utility. Compelled by the com- mon frailties of all human nature  even in a democracy  to maintain fortifications, the householder has veiled the militant aspect of his defences in the flowered robes and garlandrics of nature s diplomacy and hos- pitality. Thus reassured, his own inner hospitality can freely overflow into the fra- grantopen air and out upon the lawn; alawn whose dimensions are enlarged to both eye and mind, inasmuch as every step around its edges around its meandering shrub- bery borders is made affable and enter- taining by Flora s versatilities. At the same time, let us note in pass- ing, this enlargement is partly because the lawn not always but very much oftener than where lawns go unenclosed lies clean- breasted, green-breasted, from one shrub- and-flower-planted side to the other, along and across; free of bush, statue, urn, foun- tain, sun-dial or pattern-bed, an uninter- rupted sward. Even where there are lapses from this delightful excellence they often do not spoil, but only discount, more or less, the beauty of the general scheme, as may be noted if without offcnce we may offer it the homage of criticism in one of the gardens we have photographed  page 61  to illustrate these argumentations. Thereeight distinct encumbrances narrow the sward without in the least adding to the garden s abounding charm. The smallest effort of the reader s eye will show how largely, in a short half-day s work, the fair scene might be enhanced in lovely dignity simply by the elimination of these slight excesses, or by their withdrawal toward the lawn s mar- gins and into closer company with the tall trees. In New Orleans, where even when there are basements, of which there are many, the domains of the cook and butler are some- where else, a nearly universal feature of every sort of dwelling, the banker s on two or three lots, the laborer s on half a one, is a paved walk along one side of the house, be- tween the house and the lawn, from a front gate to the kitchen. Generally there is but the one front gate, facing the front door, with a short walk leading directly up to this door. In such case the rear walk, beginning at the front door-stcps, turns squarely along the house s front, at its comer turns again as squarely to the rear as a drill sergeant and follows the dwelling s ground contour with business precision being a business path. In fact, it is only the same path we see in un- crowded town life everywhere in our land. But down there it shows this peculiarity, that it is altogether likely to be well bor- dered with blooming shrubs and plants along all that side of it next the lawn. Of course, it is a I a u 11 that t his shrubberv I     r     .  r -and .ill the mure mi bet au e il is verv .1    t to lie, Us in three    f 1  ur ill list ratii    1      iages h j,  1;.   4 . a rose border should. .-' 1 "Hen a.-- it is.

For, notwithstanding all their shut-in state, neither their virtues nor their faults are bid from  he passing eye. The street fence, oftenest of iron, is rarely more than breast high and is always an open fence. Against its inner side frequently runs an evergreen hedge never taller than the fence's top. Commonly it is not so tall, is always well clipped, and is so civil to strangers that one would wish to see its like on every street front, though he might prefer to liiul il not so invariably of the one sort of growth  a small, handsome privet, that is, which nevertheless fulfils its office with the per- fection nf a solid line of palace sentries. I nhu kily there still prevails a very old- fashioned tendency to treat the front fence as in itself ornamental and to forget two things: l irst, that its nakedness is 110 part of its ornamental value; that it would be much handsomer lightly clothed under-   lothed like, probably, its very nexl neigh- bor; clothed with a hedge, either dose   r loose, and generously kept below the pass- er's line of sight. And, second, that from 62 the householder s point of view, looking streetward from his garden's inner depth, its fence, when implanted., is a blank inter- ruption to his whole fair scheme of mean- dering foliage and bloom, which, on the other three sides, frame in the lawn, as though I he garden were a lovely stage scene w ith the fence for footlights, and some one had left the footlights unlit. A lovely stage scene u itliout a hint of the stage s unreality, we say; for the side and rear fences and walls, being frankly tin- ornamental, call for more careful manage- ment than the front and are often charm- ingly treated.   Page 65.J  See, for an ex- ample of a sidefence with front half of wire, and rear half of boards, page 62, and for solid w alls, pages 64 and 66.  Where they separate neighbor's front lawns they may be low and open, but back of the building- line, being oftenest tight and generally more than head high, they are sure to be draped with sin h 1 limbing lloral fineries as honey- suckles, ivies, jasmines, white and yellow, lantanas, roses, or the Madeira vine. More frequently than not they are planted, also, in strong masses, with ever so many beau- tiful sorts of firmer stemmed growths, her- baceous next the sod, woody behind, as- I hu Midwinter tianlm.s ot New   sembled accnrdiug t"  t:iiur  .

Il had lieen a private garden, ils owner had given il to the city. Along its broad- side. wliii h our windows looked out upon, stood perfet tly straight and upright across the -4 v in ihe south of them a row of mag- nolias i gram lillora  at least sixtv feet high, with their holes, as smooth as the beech, trimmed hare lor two-thirds of their stature. The really decorative marks of the trim- ming had heen so many years, so many decades, healed as to show that no harm had come of it or would come. The soar- ing. dark green, glittering foliage stood out against the almost perpetually blue and white sky. Hevotid them, a few yards within the place but not in straight line, rose even higher a number of old cedars I lie Midwinter  wardens   it New Orleans similarly treated and offering a pleasing contrast to the magnolias by the feathcrv texture of their dense sprays and I he very different cast of tlieir lack lustre green. Overtopping all,   n the farther line of I lie grounds, southern line, several pecan trees of nearly a hundred feet in height, leafless, with a multitude of broad spreading boughs all high in air by natural habit, gave an elfeo strongly like lhat of winter elms, though much enlivened by the near com- pany of the evergreen masses of c edar and magnolia. These made the upper-air half of the garden, the other hall being as semblcd below. For the lofty trim of the wintergreen trees the beautv of which may have been learned from the palms allowed and invited another planting be- neath them. Magnolias,    hen permitted to branch low, arc, to undergrowth, among the most inhospitable of trees: but in this garden, where the sunlight and the breezes passed abundantly under such high-lifted arms and among such clean, bare stems, a congregation of shrubs, undershrubs, and plants of every stature and breadth, arose, llourished, and  lowered without stint. Yonder the wind-split, fathom-long leaves of the banana, brightening the bai kground, arched upward, drooped again, and faintly oscillated t    the air's caress. Here bloomed and smelled the delicate magnolia luscata, and here, redder with flowers than green with shining leaves, shone the camellia.

Hut there they were, under those ordinarily so intolerant trees, prospering and singing praises with them, some in full blossom and peri time, some waiting their turn, like parts of a choir.

MONARCHICAL SOCIALISM IX CLICMAXV I   LI me i Roberts IK motive of this w riling is to convey sumo notion of the extent in which the associ- ated monarchies, forming the  ierman imperial state, are engaged in protit yield- ing undertakings that in other states are usually leit entirely to persons and com panics. Americans are acquainted with the aims of the Social I  emo :ratic party, the rcvohitionarv socialism of l.lermanv, with three and a quarter millions of voters, organized, irreconcilable, atlame with zeal. That might be i ailed the paper s. .  ialism in Germany. Perhaps  paper socialism" is too light a phrase to use toward a force so formidable and so implacable. Iti, how- ever, the doctrinaire socialism of  lermanv that has not yet passed a law, nor admin- istered a parish. The socialism in being, the only collective ownership ol mines, rail- ways, lands, forests, and other instruments of production, is monarchical socialism, ex- istent bv acts of the crown in co-operation v. ilhconservative parliamentary ma jorities. The imperial government and the s "'' emments of the  .Ierman states took prohts in iqo8, from the various businesses con- ducted by them, of  277,385,005. Estimat- ing the caj'iital value at a 4 percent, ratio, the value ol the productive state-owned proper- ties is  6,035,627,375. Roundly, the gov- ernments operate dividend-yielding works, lands, and means of communication worth  7,000,000,000, and the governments con- tinue to fi illow a policy of fresh acquisitions. Taking the federated states together, 38 per cent, of all the financial requirements for governmental purposes were met last year out of profits on government owned enter- prises. Including the imperial g     eminent, a new-comer with relatively lew possessi' 'iis, one-quarter of all the expenses oi the stale and the imperial governments on army, navy, and all other purposes, were paid out of the net profits on government busi- nesses. Among the undertakings arc n   tobacco, spirit, or match monopolies. The miniature ducal monarchy of Schaumburg-Lippe, with a population of 44.992, and an area of i t square miles, made $200,150 from property owned col- lectively, or 5 per i ent. of the requirements of the stale. The -till smaller principality of Rcuss, the elder, with 122 square miles area, and a population ol 70, 03, has an income o  S 10,000, the Smallest actually, and the smallest in proportion of any of the German states. The little neighbor of Reuss, Schwarzbnrg- Rudolstudt, has $550,- 000, or close lo mu' halt all the public re- quirements. derived Inun state domains and mines. Schwarz   urg-Si mderhauscn draws 55 per cent, of the budget from farms and forests; 1 ildeiiburg, 22 percent.; Met klenburg-Strcli tz. 40.14 percent. Hut il is the great stales ol llie empire where state management of large properties shows the more important results. Bavaria pays  9 per cent, ol ;ill the administrative costs from public-owned properties: Saxony, 31 percent.; Wuriembcrg, 38.7 per cent.; and Prussia, 47.36 per cent. Prussia, which forms about five-eighths of the empire, has a constantly in  Teasing revenue from state- owned enterprises, w hit h yielded, in 1008, net returns of about Si 70,000,000, or more than twice the st.in-'s income from taxes, which was 885.4%  .000; the average in- come from taxation per capita w as 18.1 marks; while the average per capita taken in taxation was 8.7 marks. In that year the state, owing to extensions in canals, railw ays, and other public works, raised bv loans what amounted to an average per capita of 7.1 marks. Che state income from public properties amounted, in 190S, to somewhat more than the total income from taxation and from borrowings. The railways were the largest source of income, and netted $149,755,000. or about .S per cent, on the total invested by Prussia in its railw ay system since the state began to buy and build railways, in 1848-40. Prussia derived from other sources, from its crown forests, the leased farms, the iron, coal, potash, salt, and other mines, the porcelain factories, banking, and a variety of less Monarchical Socialism in Germany important industries. $20,000,000. Ihr policy of Prussia. whit Ii dominates the i'tn pire, is strongly in the dim lion of im Teas- ing tl if participation of tin- government in industrial enterprises. The Prussian legis lature, acting upon a recommendation of the emperor, in the speo  li from the throne al the      n-i i i 11   ol llii- I   i i   I in iqoo, passed a bill extending widely an old act, giving the slate the right to taker over at a val nation any discovery of mineral riches on private lands. German manufai luring and mining is rather more completely under the control nf combinations than is the industry of any other country. The   losely organized syndicates in the coal and iron industries control production and selling prices more effectively than does the Cniled States steel corporation in the I niled States. The Prussian government, in its desire to have a seat in the coal syndicate, determined three years ago to buy a controlling interest in the shares of the Hibernia Coal Com- pany, mining 7 per tent.     the coal in the Rhine-Westphalian region. The Dresdner Bank, acting under a private arrangement with the Prussian treasure, bought shares on the sloe k-exchange until a majority of the capitalization had bee-.i a  quired. The announcement that Prussia had bought the control of the company so vexed the group of coal owners who had previously ruled the company that they increased the   apitali- zatioil, and issued the new shares to them- selves, thus reacquiring a majority. The Prussian government brought a suit to pro- nounce the new issue illegal, but after the intermediate 1 ourts and the supreme ' ourt of the empire had decided against the Prussian contention, the matter has been dropped, .so far ;i  the Hibernia Company is concerned. The policy of Prussia re- main  unchanged, and further efforts, it is publii Iv understood, will be made bv the government to obtain a vote, not only in the 1 oal. but in the steel and other impor- tant syndicates. Prussia already has an important share in the direction of the potash syndicate. The theory of the I rus- .-ian cabinet and the crown is. that il is for the interests of the people that the state sh  111 Id take pari in industrial combinations that undertake to regulate the prices of ar- tii le-. or tlie production in anv industry. Publii opinion supports this principle. Besides t he prod in live      nerships of the empire, and ol the individual states, the cities of  iermanv have gone deeply in- to street railways, gas. electricity, water- works, slaughter houses, market halls, cold storage, canals, and wharfs. Thus the re- public of l.iibeck pays iS.2y   er cent, of ils expenses from sui h sources. Hamburg, 4. 25 per   ei 11., and Bremen, 0.07 per cent. It is a fact ol some interest that the repub lies anumg the states of the empire are far more backward in communal ownership than are the monarchies.

I  pon no department of industry does any of tlu- state governments lose except upon steamers. The grand duchy of Baden runs its internal navigation lines at a loss of Si 5,833. Saxony. Wurtemberg. and Mcck- lenburg-Schwerin gain or, their lines $7,103, so that on the whole of the state-owned steamer lines there is a loss of $8,670. This structure of collective ownership, which I have called monarchical socialism, rests upon a way of thinking in Germany, which differentiates the social and political conditions there from those of any other great industrial state. The representatives of the monarchical principle in associa- tion with the conservative classes have ac- cepted this way of thinking, and it has entered into the very texture of their ideas of government, and is supported by the great orthodox economists, such as Schind- ler and Wagner. The policy of acquiring and managing industries, lands, mines, and means of communication by the govern- ment is so vital and living a part of the German empire, the subordinate states, and the parishes, that it is slowly making Germany fundamentally different industri ally and politically from the United States, Great Britain, France, or any country that comes into comparison with Germany. The American or the Englishman when talking with a German about social or polit- Monarchical Socialism in Germanv ical questions,limls that lieand the German arc looking at tilings Irom different basal conceptions ol the functions   1 government. The Fiiglishman has that background of eight centuries, during which his race has developed individual liberty, and has given free political institutions, or some form of them, to all other modern states, in  hiding Germany. A social system has been de- veloped whose key idea is to give the citizen free play lo his individuality. The system has worked well and continues to work in the United Kingdom, the great associated colonial states, and in America. The t ier- man, while modified by the individualist school of thinking, lias grown up among a different order of ideas prevailing on the Continent, derived in part from Roman law and from autocratic monarchical practice. The individual has had a less important place in the organism. The strength, wel- fare, and health of the whole lias been the ruling conception. Hence it was possible for an enlightened society, such as that in France, to have a vigorous sincere party urging, during the Dreyfus trial, that it were better for an individual to suffer wrong than for the state to be weakened by loss of respect for the French army. The English point of view would be that it were better for a state that could not give an individual justice to perish in the endeavor to do so, than for society to maintain prestige lor an institution through a disregard for the rights of one person. The Hohen .ollerns in Prussia, and the monarchies in the minor German states, in dealing with the pressure of their peoples for greater political rights, look into full consideration the economic reasons that caused political fermentation. The mon archies gave a progressively better admin istration, and undertook the responsibil ity of protecting the weaker members of society against economic misery. The so- called Prussian common law, as modified by Frederic William II, promulgated July i, 1704, condemned idleness, recognized the right of every subject to work, and de- fined the state to be the protector ol the poor. The common law proclaimed: I. It is the duty of the state to provide for the sustenance and support of those of its subjects who cannot obtain subsistence for themselves. IF Work adapted to their strength and capacities shall be supplied to those who lack means and opportunity of earning a living for themselves and those dependent upon them. ill. I hose who, Irom laziness. love of idleness, or other irregular proclivities, do not choose to employ the.' means ollered them of earning a living shall be kept at use- ful work by compulsion and punishment, under pro  er c mtri  1.

The police authority of every place must prov ide for all poor and destitute per sons, whose subsistenc e cannot be insured in any cither way. This fundamental law supplemented by the Stcin-Hardenberg legislation of the second decade of the last century, was the foundation upon which Bismarck stood, when, on May 0, iNS.j, in speaking upon industrial insurance, he proclaimed the doctrine of the right of work:   Give the workingman vv 1 irk as long as lie is healthy, assure him care when he is sic k, insure him maintenam e when he is old.

'  live me work,  and that the state is bound to give him work     But large public works would be neces sary,  exclaimed an opponent. "Of course,  replied Bismarck. "Let them be undertaken. Why not   It is the state s duty.  The Bi-man kian polic ies, carried out with the full approval of the old emperor, and l v conservative majorities in the Prus- sian legislature and the imperial parlia- ment, have left as deep an impression upon the social life of  lermany as his part in the unification of Germany. Modern Ger- many began with him to abolish pauperism, to make ordered provision for indigent old age, the sick, and the disabled. Poverty is abundant in Germany, but il does not shade olT so quickly into pauperism next- door to starvation as it does in the Fnited Kingdom and in some American cities. Monarchical Socialism in  jcrniany The poverty is one that can, with self- respe  I, receive medical aid or maintenan  e nl right from funds tn which il has con- tributed, and will continue to contribute. These measures, while quite a separate  . Iiapter from state parti  ipation in indu ;rrv, are interrelated, because both art  conse- t ueuces t f the dominant school t f political thinking that finds stability and health lor society through the state sharing in busi- ness. and in compulsory prov isions against the social maladies ol pauperism and the unemployed. The aim of the government in iis polity nl acquisition and control of mines, of com- munication and transport, and of sharing, to some extent, in all production whether agricultural, mineral, or industrial, is not primarily to raise revenue. 'Die declara- tion of Bismarck upon the subject of state ownership of railways continues lo be true, lie saitl: " I do not regard railways as in the main intended to be an object of financial com- petition; according to my view, railways are intended more for the service of traffic than of finance, though it would, of course, be foolish to say that they should not bring financial advantages. The surpluses whic h the states receive in the form of net profits, or which go to shareholder  in the form of dividends, are really the taxation whit h the states might impose upon the traffic by reason of its privilege, but which, in the i a sc of private railways, falls to share- holders." The state railway systems of Germany are managed upon two general principles, f irst, they art1 to serve the general interests ol domestic and external trade, and second, they are to show a satisfactory profit. The Prussian railway administration in itjo.S lowered its regular freight tariffs for 64 per cent, of the traffic, in order to serve the exigencies of trade, especially export trade, during a period of commercial depression. The government is in a position in tier- many to influence llie whole machinery of trade anti transportation as no other gov- ernment in the world can do, and this fact must be taken into account when other people-, think of I oinpeling oil equal terms with the   iermans in the far bast or in South Amerit a. The administration of the railways, tele- graphs, telephones, mines, and the pub- lic domains by the state is possible only through trained civil servants. The effi- ciency of state-managed mines and fac- tories in competition with privately owned enterprises in Germany comes from the character of the bureaucracy. This per- manent civil service is one of the greatest glories of Germany, and one of the most powerful of reasons upholding the nn - iian liic a I principle in a semi-autocratic form in Germany. The Prussian bureaucracy, the model of the other German states, is the c reation ol ihe Hohcnzollern family during three centuries. It had been developed and improved under all the efficient sover- eigns of the llohcnzollcrn line, such as the Great Elector and Frederick the Great, and it has been a principle of the private polity of the I lohenzollern family to rule through a body of civil servants, whose plat e in llie stale is as honorable as that of the army, or perhaps it would be more just to say as ranking next to the army. The non-partisan administrative body, with its own disciplinary courts for cutting out of the public service any member who uses his official position to favor a private in- terest, either his own or that of another, has kept the civil service up to a code of honor that can be compared in the United States only to the codes regulating the army and the navy. Thus in Germany a public, servant, because of the power that his class possesses, the personal distinc- tion, and the social position that go with the public service, is willing to work for llie state for less than he could receive in llie service of a private company. The chiefs of technical bureaus in the mining, agri- culture or forestry, telegraph, telephone, or railway services, are paid from  1,750 to $3,000 a year. The director-general of the Alsace Lorraine railways is paid S.3,375, and an allowance for house rent. District superintendents on the Prussian lines, each of whom has supervision over from 1.500 to 2,000 miles of line, are paid 82,750 a year, with free dwellings. It frequently happens that men in the government ser- vice of unusual capacity reject tillers from private concerns of two or three times the salaries they are receiving. The officials who decline such proposals have the same feeling about them that a United States army engineer would have, liis pride in the service, the sense of usefulness to the Williams Psychic Disturbances country, the social consideration shown to his service, and  lie certainty of being pro- moted regularly, and of having a pension upon his retirement, make the puMic scr vice more attractive than a private mie could be. The present emperor has the passion for efliciency which was the most eminent quality in Frederick the Great. The emperor trusts, and in evcrv possible manner honors, the civil servant who has done an exceptional thing. As Mr. Bryce says of Frederick, it was not enough for this great man that a thing was well dune, but that it must be done in tlu- best possible manner. The qualities ami the eflic iencies that are required of the bureaui rat have made it possible fur the German Kmperor as King of Prussia to retain his autocratic power in the stale during .1 period when democratic government has ruled the great neighboring states, with the exception of Russia, and during a period when Ger- many has made its greatest advances in   ulture and in industry. II it should be that German statesmen have hold of true principles in the owner- ship anil management of produi live prop- erties by the state, Germany has the start by a century over other nations. It may be that a political industrial system that tends to limit indi vidnalism, as il is under- stood in the I niled States, mav produce in a further development liner individuals because of what the German conceives to be a more balanced justice. Whether that be so or not, conservatives in Germany have faith in their svstem, and believe that subsequent generations of other peoples will imd well being in doing as the Ger mans are doing. There il is, a mighty phenomenon in the industrial life of one of the most advanced nations.

Thai evening he tried to fall into a trance but he fell asleep in the process and, although he re- peated his efforts in a purely scientific frame of mind, nothing happened, and he was 011 the point of asking his mother ahoul it when suddenly as was generally the case with William a new idea came to him. He al- ways hugged his ideas to his very soul, be- cause he found that they were seldom re- ceived with favor by grown-ups, and for two or three days his heart was full of joy.

Mr. Madison smiled in- credulously later in the evening when he heard of William s trance.

After the formalities were over he quickly withdrew from the con- versation with a few cakcs, abstracted from the tea-table for future use, and was forgotten.

Followed by Mrs. Madison, she tiptoed over to the couch. For a mo- ment the gurgles continued and then grad- ually merged into coherent, but hesitating, enunciation.

After she had disengaged herself from Mrs. Madison s en- thusiastic embrace she turned to the couch.

With a frown on his face he leaned back in a corner and neglected the bundle of even- ing newspaper  lying on the seat In-side him. The day in the Street hail been trying and Jarvis, usually at peace with the world, was in a bad humor. The stock of one of hi  pet railroads had been attacked 1  %  the bears; the price had gone tumbling down throughout the session of the Stock l' - change, and that was exactly what he did not want to happen. Some strong influence was at work, but with all his skill he had not been able to discover from what source the attack had come, and unless he could check the onslaught Mr. Jarvis Madison stood to lose a million, perhaps more. Consequently when he reached his home he gave but indifferent attention to Mr . Madison's news regarding William s ac- tion:- and dismissed the r  mantic announce- ment involving Aunt Jane with: I knew she would." He hurried through his dinner and shortly after received a group of his a an- nates who had been hastily summoned to a conference. He outlined his plans for the next day concisely and with the boldness that had made him famous, and remarked in closing: "I d give ten thousand dollars if I could find out before the market opens to- morrow who is back of it all. 1 sus- pect Billings, but he has been in Cuba for the last six weeks. If it is he 1 think I could make things so interesting t  r him in his Western line that he would not bother me for the next ten years. I think we can pull through anyhow, but it would be a great relief to know the exact source of the attack.  The partv filed out into the night, and after the door had closed Mr. Madison stood in the hall a moment thinking. Then he mounted slowlv the broad stairway to the library above. Had he not been so busy with his thoughts he might have noticed William's face peering with reckless ex- citement from behind the drawing-room hangings. When his father disappeared, he emerged from his hiding place and went up the stairs one at a time. He. too, was engaged in deep thought. He stopped b  the library door and looked inside: his father was 'itting in an casy-chair with his head resting on his hand and his mother was reading by a low light near him. and William hesitated. He puckered up his brows and then William was a chip of the old block quick decision came to him and he went quietly into the library and. unno- ticed, arranged himself comfortably on the couch.

After a few preliminary gurgles William lapsed into silence and Mr. Madi- son started to speak.  Sh   warned Mrs. Madison. The honk of a passing motor broke the stillness, but Mr. Madison obeyed his wife s warning finger and they waited and listened. They were rewarded shortly when William, with- out his usual stage settings, in a voice that was robust and strong, broke the silence with:  POUND MADISON BILLINGS.  Mr. Madison gripped the arms of his chair and half rose, a strange expression on his face.  Is he saying anything that interests you   asked Mrs. Madison. Triumph was in her eves.  He s saved me about a million if what he says is true,  announced Mr. Madison with a gasp as he sank back in his chair and watched William. Mrs. Madison said noth- ing.

Yes, sir,  he said,  if you ll come up-stairs.  Followed by his father, he led the way past his own room and the servants' quar- ters until they emerged on the roof.  There,  he said with a dramatic gesture which took in the whole heavens silver with the light of a brilliant moon. Mr. Madison looked about him for a moment in some doubt, and then, catching sight of a net-work of wires stretched be- tween two chimneys, he smiled.  I see,  he said finally.  Did you manage this wireless business yourself    Yes,  answered William excitedly.  Mr. Dripp, on the Celtic, told me how to do it and where I could get the fittings. I ve got the receiver down in my closet. It's as easy as pie. I can't read the mes- sages right off yet, but I mark down the dots and dashes and translate them after- ward.

I think vou had lietter go to bed now,  said Mr. Madison, but before lie left the roof he looked out over the twinkling lights of the city to the south. Somewhere out there in the moonlight he knew that there was a ship heading toward New York, and he smiled when he thought of what was going to fall out of the air into the con- sciousness of one of its passengers, John Gordon Billings, before the stock market was open an hour the next morning. After W illiam's Psychic I disturbances inspecting William s receiving instrument he parted from that young gentleman and started down-stairs tingling with the fun he war. going to have with John Billings.

The juror is sworn to render hiverdict according to the evidence submitted to him anil the law in the case. In Pennsylvania, at least, bv decision ol the Supreme Court of that State, the jury is de  lared the judge of the hr.e as well as of the evident e in crim- inal trials. By what tine-spun reasoning the administration of justice in civil causes may be considered to involve different prin- i ii les. the s   ei ial Iiigii i  1 the legal mind will no doubt discover: but in criminal trials in Pennsylvania, il il is not s   elsewhere, it would seem as il the Supreme Court has relegated the sitting judge to llie position "t a sort of presiding olVncr or   hicf i lerk or upper bailiff, to keep order in the court and t" see that the jury is not interfered with in its duties. Yet often the judge still pr.n In ally ilirei 1-. the verdit t, and perhaps commonly, and properly, inlluemcs it. I he late  udgc Waddell, a verv able, upright, and fair-minded judge of a t imntv i ourt. whose agreeable personality made it a pleasure to sit under him, had some wars ago a case of   riminal libel sent back to him 11v the Supreme Court, on appeal, for retriai on llie ground that in his charge he had instructed the jury that under the law as he expounded il a verdict of guilty should be rendered. I was present at the second trial and distinctly remember the opening words of his t harge.   Gentlemen of the jurv," he .said, smarting under an unaci ustomeil reversal.   I want first to say to you that in this case you are to judge the as well as the facts. Don't forget that; the Supreme Court has so decided and that is the law in Pennsylvania. I repeal it, you arc to judge the law. But you have sworn to render your verdict upon the evi- dence before you, and I want to say that the best evidence you can have of what is the law governing this case is what I tell you it is " Whereupon he proceeded t   jav do n the law, the jury promptly con-  ii ted the defendant, who as promptly ap- pealed again to the Supreme Court and was promptly granted a third trial. 1 believe he was Imallv acquitted or the case was dropped. There was no criticism by the Supreme Court of Judge Waddell s inter- pretation of the actual law in the case, as I remember it, but simply that he was over- stepping his authority w hen he imposed his interpretation on the jury. The Supreme Court   decision still stands, and is recog- nized theoretically as law ; yet perhaps cases might still be appealed successfully on the ground that it is ignored. It would seem too plain for argument that judges should not set an example of evasion of law. In a recent murder trial in Tennessee, a rouse ee rhre, the judge took a very remark- able i oiirse. When the time came to read his charge, to quote from the published ac- counts of llie episode:    The law makes the judge the witness of the law,' remarked I udge I lari,  so I will now take the witness stand and give mv testimony.  He left the bench, walked around to the witness chair which ha- been the centre of attraction for two months and began to read.  It is difficult to think of any more definitive way, aside from iis spectacular features, in which he could have put himself on record, at this stage, as a mere witness in the case testify- ing before the jury a  tolhe law, recogniz- ing the jurv as the real court having judg- ment of the law as well the facts. He ccnild Some Difficulties of a Juryman 87 not have made clearer admission that the case in which he was engaged was a "trial by jury,  to use the old and familiar legal phrase. Lawyers, as other folk, sometimes use words loosely. One often hears of a judge  trying  a ease, sometimes from his own lips; the prosecuting attorney often announces that he will or will not  try  a case; the defending counsel says so, too; hut the theory of jury trial seems certainly to be that the one judges, the other prose- cutes, and the third defends; but it is the jury which  tries   threshes  it out,  separates, as what is good from what is bad  in the first meaning of the word, or in the derived meanings,  puts to the test or proof,   brings to a decision  in the retire- ment of the jury room. Probably in the majority of cases it is the opinion of the judge, so far as the jurors can gather it from his charge, which makes the verdict of the jury. Speeches of attorneys for prosecution or defence carry little weight in the retirement of the jury room, so far as my observation goes; I re- call only once that such a speech was men- tioned in considering a verdict, and then a juryman arguing for the defendant criti- cized the man s own counsel  I have ob- served, however, that the charge of the judge is listened to with grave attention, and his opinion, if it is at all indicated in the charge, is frequently referred to in the jury room when the rase is doubtful. In all the many charges I have listened to there remains the recollection of but two that struck me as unjust; and in general they have seemed conspicuously fair-minded. In one of these exceptions I was myself the plaintiff in the action, many years ago, so that hardly counts. In the other, I was a juror in a civil case, and the judge had an unfortunate in- firmity of temper, due to ill health, which often caused him to scold and hector. It was excused by everybody on account of his high personal character and conspic- uous ability on the bench. He was essen- tially a just man, universally respected, and with a quite unusual capacity for ren- dering justice; but he always seemed to want to render it himself and to have no use for the jury unless he could not make up his own mind, which was seldom. In the case in question, a damage suit against a corporation, he charged the jury quite strenuously for the defendant; but in spite of that the vote stood six to six when first taken and would certainly have shown a large majority for the plaintiff, if not una- nimity, had it not been- for the judge s charge. Several jurors, indeed, expressed actual fear of punishment if the verdict should be rendered in accordance with their own convictions of justice and had to be reasoned with on that score. I think even then the verdict might have been a substantial one for the plaintiff, hut after some hours the judge sent for the jury, heartily abused us collectively for not ren dering his verdict, warned us not to  allow this jury to be dominated by one obstinate man  I fancy he had in mind a very quiet and innocent countryman who was scarcely opening his mouth in the jury room and was voting with the judge and finally sent us back with the announce- ment that he was about to adjourn court until Monday morning, it then being Fri- day, but that the clerk would remain for an hour or so to record our verdict if we agreed on one. After that a judgment for the plaintiff was hopeless; we were threat- ened with imprisonment for at least two days if we did not promptly agree, and with but a few minutes to spare the defendant corporation got its verdict. If ever an agreement was reached under coercion and  duress of imprisonment,  that would seem to be one. The counsel for plaintiff, learning the state of affairs in the jury room, which he did before we left court, took an appeal and got a retrial. The case was ultimately settled out of court, I think. This particular judge was rarely reversed on appeal; lie was a most worthy and esti- mable man, though inclined to be arbi- trary, as United States judges often are. In this case, as in others where the judge rails at the jury, it would seem as if he were really guilty of that  contempt of court  which jurymen as well as others are some- times accused of. The judge and the lawyers side with him seems to think that he is  The Court,  sometimes so styles himself, and sometimes is addressed by that term, yet he is after all only a part of it, if properly the most considerable part, though the juror is as essentially a part, too.

In that one case, at least, 1 have known the fear "1 it powerfully to influence jurymen in i  'in ins; in a vcrdii I against I heir ci  u   i  lions. 11 that w as a % iolath  11 of thoir oath, il il was perjury, then il is hard to sec why the ai t   if the i hi lge which I ir  night ii a In    11 .is not sul 11 irnaIi  n. 111 si unc civil causes I he judge has a pi. 11 lice   f issuing " binding instructions" 0  ihe jur ' to render a particular vcrdii I where lie is convinced the law would not justify anv other.

To the lay mind il would -.vein 1 leal that no sworn juror should 0  11 sen 1 lo aiiept instructions from anv one. And the w hole proceeding is simply a con- venience to save a few moments in time, for if the judge should explain the matter to the jury and send them out, they would come bai k at once with the proper verdict at least ninety-nine times out of a hundred, if not invariably. There is probably no miscarriage of justice from this practice, but as a short cut il seems unreasonable, unnecessary, arbitrary, and improper; yet few practices arc more firmly engrafted on court procedure. There is a case re- lenth reported where a coroner, appar- ently w ishing lo shield the police from dan- ger of prosecution for false arrest, forced his jury to accuse a particular person of murder when they had brought in an open  crdiit against "parlies unknown,  which lie declined lo receive and bullied the jurors into changing il as lie wished. The evi- dence, 11 mav be said, was so slight that llie person accused by the coroner was never even indicted, but was discharged on hearing. No judge in this country would dare to 1  im mi I a jury for their verdict, though jurvmen arc sometimes afraid of it; but verdicts have been known to be received with scolding and abuse, and the offending jurors dismissed from further service in disgrace. Sometimes judges openly show their disagreement with the conclusions of the jury in a way that does not tend to en- hance respect for the jury system. 1 once heard a judge call back to the bar of a court a man who had iust been acquitted and tell him that lie need tmt think he left that court room in the character of an innocent man, even though Ihe jury had pronounced him not guilty. And in another case the judge ordered the acquitted man back into the custody of the court while he inquired of the district attorney w hether there was no way in which he could be tried over again. I was not in llie jurv box in either of these cases, but from what 1 heard of the evi- dence il seemed to me both verdicts were just, and that it was not in good form to 1 asi relict lions upon them. In I ngland it has been claimed that in theory jurors are even to day liable to line for bringing in a verdict "eontrarv to the direction oi the cmirl in matters of law," though il is said that this is disputable and "certainly would never now be attempted in prai tii e." Before 1 170 jurors who per- Sonic I  iiii  ultics   if ;i Jurxnmn si sled in acquitting prisoners whom the judges  vishe l convicted were i if ten lined and imprisoned. In tlu- celebrated case nf llie acquittal nf William Penn and Mead, the presiding utlicer o    mirl, the recorder, said to the jury, alter they had lieen  ir ulently aliused during llie trial: "I am sorry, gentlemen, you have followed vmir own judgments and opinions, rather than the good and w holesotne advice whu h was given you; God keep my life out of vmir hands; but tor 111 is the   01,1 rt tines vou I.  rt   marks a man, and imprisonment till paid." They were discharged from Newgate jail upon habeas corpus and  their   nmmit mcnt was adjudged illegal."    ther cases of the kind were brought before the House of  '1 immons, which rest lvcd " 1 hat tlie   re- cedents and practice of lining or imprison- ing jurors for verdicts is illegal." And "finally, in 1670. it '.'.as solemnly decided by the Court of King s Bench that the practice was contrary to law." The same principle of law which protects jurors from punishment by line or imprisonment w hen the judge thinks their verdi  t a perversion of justice, it would seem, ought to protect them as well from le  er punishment bv scolding or open contempt. It their judg- ment is honest, even though mistaken, they arc entitled to be treated with rcspecr; if they have entered into a   onspiraey to per vert justice they should be indii ted and tried as for any other 1 rime.     oldmg and openly manifested contempt i  ill judge l in either case; it is either an inadequate punishment or it is unjust and improper. When the jury return.-; a verdii t it i- the judgment of the inurt; and tor the -itting judge to treat that judgment of the  . urt flippantly or contemptuously bei him- lie disagrees i11  it tends to bring the whole system into disrepute. I Iis plain duty i  to do what he can to elevate the system of trial by jury so long as it is ,111 essential pa 11 ol our jurisprudence. It has tallen into a cer- tain degree of contempt, and lor this state of affairs judges cannot lie held entirely guiltless. It is doubtless only the very few who commit improprieties, but llie great majority of righteous judges have a power of influence if they would exercise it. and it might be of prolit to ask themselves why it is that when .1 man is obliged to serve as a juror many of his friends think it the same sort of joke as if he were arrested and fined lor speeding a motorcar. It   - hard to think o  anv more eltei live wav to en- hance the dignilv ol trial bv jurv in the mind ol the publii than bv respei 1 diown to the juror  in the iourt room; and that is largely, il not entirely, at present in the hands o  the judge.

Many of them are per haps not altogether tnnvimed of that, the pleasing platitude  of expositors of   Anglo- Saxon law " notwithstanding. Il mav be questioned whether the tendency is gniwing to take the system seriously ; one sometimes hears lawyer  question its value and ex- press preference for trial without jury. The question as to how a serious diver- gence ol view in the jury room should be dealt with ha  presented much difficulty and ha  often been discussed. I Xpericnce in jurv service does not seem to suggest any entirely satisfactory remedy; and in prac- tice it  eems impossible to avoid at times some degree ol pressure upon the minority to t.rei on w ith tli... lai-mes- ol the c , :I r and avoid unreasonable mistrial .

The plaintiff, on the stand, thought his damage might be three hundred atul 1111v dollar . Personally I thought the injury insignificant, if any; but the eleven other jttrvmen had no doubt whatever that a telephone company always injures tree  or anything else at every opportunity.

Tn many minds the one so insensibly merges into the other that it is hard lo draw llie line. Human sympathy naturally plavs it  p.irt, not improperly, notwithstanding the legal theory that a juryman must attempt the impossible and dehumanize himself.

In another ease a w hite girl w as accusing a negro of an attempt at felonious assault. 1 h r own testimony showed that al the lime of the occurrence there had been no thought of w rong 011 either side, but that what was merely a somewhat unseemly scuttle had been magnified by her parents into serious attempt al 1 rime and that suggestion put into her head. Kleven of the jury in short order came to that coin lusion, notwith- standing a little evident race prejudice; but the twelfth juror frankly said that he wanted coiiviitioti simply 011 1 lie ground that the ao used was a negro. In fact, he had made that announcement at the noon lunch recess of court, before he had heard the evidence. At the last moment, when adjournment for the night was at hand, the rest made a dead set at him and brought him in Where one unreasonable man i.s holding up a v erdii t in which he ought to join, all vorl- of pressure i  often brought to hear and there appears to be no other way out. The judge locks the jury up indefinitely to foti e an agreement. 111 England, I believe, the jurors are confined in an uniurnished room, unhealed in 1 old weather, and given neither food m r drink until they agree. They are starved mit. Here they are fed and every reasonable effort is made for their comfort during this imprisonment, though I have had to sleep on hard wooden benches or 1 hairs.    111 e. the 1  111v comfort able spot I could tind was I he judge's high- backed 1 hair, tilted back seductively on springs, with my feet propped up oil a pile "I law books on his desk; we were not con- fined to one room during the night, but had the range "I the court house, under guard.

X obodv likes to be isolated and most men shrink from staying in a hopeless minority. 1 have seen cases where the jury was at lirst evenly divided and where the first defection from one side to the other w as speedily followed by an agreement ol the whole.

I'nder the inilu- ence of that mollifying feeling an agreement was not very much longer delayed. It is fair to say, however, that a wish to dine at public l ost had nothing to do with the long delay in this case, which was due solely t" the sympathy of one juror who haled to lie instrumental in jailing the ai cuseil person. He did not seem to want a vcrdii I of acquittal either; but simplv a " hung jury.  a disagreement which should relieve him of a feeling of personal responsibility . A modification of the requirement of unanimity in a verdict has often been advo cated as a reform. In   iv.il cases there would not seem to be nun h danger in let- ting the judgment of nine men out of the twelve stand as the judgment of the court, reporting the divided vote as part of the verdict, so that if an appeal should be taken the figures of the vote might be considered  .if by the appellate i ourt I believe ill some o  die newer Mate.-, unanimity i- not always required In   riminal trials and it i- there tli.il die trouble mostly arises the i ase seems to be somewhat dilfercnt: but in other than i apital cases perhaps the judgment of ten might be taken without substantial risk of injusiitc.

Perhaps that is one way of con- vincing the prisoner at the bar that lie is being "tried bv his peers." In a recent minder trial in New York City, notorious ovl'i the "hole i i  ili .ed world, each juror was placed under arrest as he stepped in- to the jurv-box. even before the case had opened, and he was kept a close prisoner   unless fortunate enough to be rejected as a juror throughout the wea ris  ime weeks of that trial.

J udgcs and disirii t attorneys have been known to be bribed, or bribers, be- fore now; perhaps on the record quite as often as jurymen. Why not lock up the judge and distrii l attorney along with the jurv to 11 re veil t the possibilit v, or mi spit h m, oi their being "reached''.-' It would look to be simple r and more clfec live to buy up one judge or a prosecuting attorney. rather than twelve jurvmen. which could not be done without the active assistance of the c ourt officials themselves, and anything less w ould merely be the temporary relief of a mistrial. In any jury honestly drawn there v ill surely lie at least a preponder aiii c- o  honest men ready to resent and expose any attempt to corrupt them; and as a matter of notoriety in trials where m a ml a I has a rise n, popula r suspicion seems im.re often dire, ted against the judge or court olin ials than against the jurv. So that imprisonment of jurors during trial appears to have proved an inellei live way of a-suring publii confidence in the right- eousness o  the court. and it is surelv a hardship and, il unnecessary, an injustice, if not a misuse of judicial power. In any event, it hardly seems calculated to bring conviction of the Iheorv that " trial byjury  is the palladium of our liberties if il is pub- lii Iv announced that jurors have to be im- prisoned to prevent selling themselves out.  s to the judges, considering that so many of them a re elevated to the bench by political inlluence, or by personal political activity, we are to be congratulated on having a body of men genernllv of un- doubted high character and containing so few who are objectionable. They are, with- out doubt, mostly hard working, consci- entious, able, and upright public officials. A few, a verv lew. possibly sometimes sell justice or allow themselves to be improperly inlluenced in its administration; but that is an old story, as any one vv ho dips into the history of jurisprudence in England and other lands may know. Selling of justice is extremely am ient. older than the parable of "the unjust judge." Not quite so far baik. but still ancient, there is in the Ice- landic  saga of  The Banded Men" an amusing tale told of a corruption of the court a sort ol court of appeals, appar- ently and the details of the shifts and turns ol thi: law are lull of curious interest. It began with a   riminal prosecution which w as throw n out of c ourt on a technical plea of a ilaw in the indictment. The accused person was o  known bad character and notoriously guilty of the c rime with which he was i barged , I ml the   irosec itlor was the wealthiest man in Iceland, and two of the judges c on  octcd a scheme, in which six other.s j  iued them, to bring about a for- leiturc ol his ......Is for their joint enrich- ment on the ground that he had brought his aci usation to court illegally. Taking advantage of their own decision as to this, the eight of them "banded together" to spoil the unlucky litigant, who prepared to Il y vv ith what portable goods he could carry, lie was approached, however, by a shrewd and unscrupulous lawyer who persuaded him to hand over a large sum in silver, promising to buy him a judgment in his lavor. 'Phis able counsel first went separately to two of the most needy of the eight judges the "Banded Men" and bought them up privately, obtaining from each a promise to act il I he other one would join him. Then by a series of ingenious Some Difficulties of a Jufyman 93 legal manoeuvres he arranged that the de- cision of the court should lie in the hands of these two whom he had bought and whom the other six of  The Banded Men  were quite ready to trust to make the decision of forfeiture which was sure to incur popu- lar odium, cunningly expecting to reap the benefit and escape the blame. However, when decision came to be rendered and it was found that a nominal line was im- posed, as the saga quaintly puts it,   the Banded Men were exceedingly ill-content with this ending of the case.  The two re- pentant conspirators justified their action on the same ground that the man who turns State s evidence takes: that it is much bet- ter to forsake your fellow wrong-doers and do the right thing being paid for it than to continue in evil. From all of which we see that human nature in ancient Iceland was pretty much the same as it is in Amer- ica, and elsewhere, to-day. The case itself recalls in some features the famous case of the conspiring oil refiners in New York State who were convicted of murder in blowing up an independent refinery and causing loss of life, carried it on appeal to every higher court in the State, the verdict of conviction being affirmed on every ap- peal, and finally, by a rare excess of judi- cial severity, were scntcnccd, for murder, to pay a fine of one thousand dollars each  Having in mind ancient and modem in- stances of judicial malversation, only too frequent, though doubtless not in propor- tion to the talk about it, the honest juror, whom the court is benevolently trying to shield from a temptation to forswear him- self, might ask with some show of justice why he should specially be pickcd out for suspicion   And he might ask, too, whether there is anything in the Constitutional pro- vision that  Neither slavery nor involun- tary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States,  to save him from being locked up. He might ask, and no doubt  the court  would answer him quite to his satisfaction; and show him, constructively, that how- ever he might be in physical durance, as a theory of the law not to say a legal fig- ment he wasn t locked up, or imprisoned, or restrained of his liberty, or in duress at all; but that really he was enjoying a very dignified position as a chief constituent of the court, under suspicion unfortunately, engaged in the solemn and important pub- lic function of trying a fellow  peer  for his life. Whether the person being tried has any right to object to a. verdict rendered by a jury in the custody of tipstaves or bailiffs  under legalized  duress of imprisonment,  one might call it is a question which judges would, no doubt, have scant patience to an- swer. As to   involuntary servitude,  being forced to serve against one s will under lock and key is certainly a form of that forbidden thing in the ordinary usage of speech, how- ever easy it may be to say that in the eye of the law it does not mean it. The whole matter ought to be definitely regulated by statute; and it seems worth considering whether better results might not be had by leaving the jury to the nat- ural liberty of free citizens. The  honor system  has been found to work very well with lads at college and to have promoted honesty in examinations; is it more likely to fail in the case of mature men engaged in an important public duty  The college lad when treated as a suspect is found often to yield to that suggestive influence, and, on the other hand, to respond well to the power of the suggestion that he can be trusted. The juryman is called upon to fill a position of public trust; is he less likely than an im- mature boy to respond to the suggestion of trust  The juror of the better sort can hardly avoid a more or less conscious sense of in- dignity in being placed in custody; and I think that is one of the reasons why he often tries to cscapc scrvice and serves reluctantly when he is obliged to. There has been fre- quent complaint of the character of juries, often without justification; but only selected names go upon the lists from which jury- men are drawn and the fault lies with those whose duty it is to make up the lists. If every member of the bar were obliged to serve a term as a juryman it would not hurt him, and if the judge were called upon occasionally to step down from the bench for the same service he would probably learn something of value in the conduct of his official duty. It should not compromise his dignity, if the importance of trial by jury is really so great as the text-books say. In any event, whatever makes for the real dignity of the juryman s position and his sense of it, cannot be otherwise than of pub- lic benefit so long as we cling to the system. 94 Sorrw Difficulties of a Juryman If indignity is unavoidable, by al  means let us endure it patiently; but if it is not, let us have bctterconditions. If the lawyer thinks the present treatment of juries is perfect, he is the very man to try it; but his fellow- members of the bar would doubtless chal- lenge him every time he stepped into the box. If any reform is needed it is a question, with something to be said on both sides, whether it should be by legislative enact- ment or amply by the initiative of the judges in changing rules of court. It is undoubt- edly the theory on which this republic was founded that the people should govern themselves by their own laws, enacted by legislative bodies whom they should elect for that purpose, rather than by court- made law. Tlie late James C. Carter, in Ms posthumous work, held strenuously that what he called   the unwritten law,  founded on   the customs of a free people,  is higher and superior to the " written,f or statute law; but that is not at all the con- viction which inspired the framers of this government. In the United States there is no law except what is sanctioned by some sort of legislative act by those who stand as representatives of the people. The Common Law of England Is only law in these American States where It has been expressly so sanctioned, anti in at least one State is not law. Indeed, in our early his- tory so strong was the fear of English court decisions, which make up the body of the Common Law, as McMaster shows in his monumental   History of the People of the United States,  that in 1810 the Pennsyl- vania Legislature passed an act  forbid- ding the citation of any English decisions made since July fourth, 1776." This re- mained the law in Pennsylvania for twenty- five years, the act not being repealed until 1836, as Dr. McMastcr tells me. The courts and the judges are themselves creatures of statute, and perhaps any exten- sion ot limitation of their powers may most safely be accomplished by enactment rather than be left to the discretion of judges of court. In the theory of this republic govern- ment is to be conducted by three separated and distinct departments: First, the legislative bodies are to make or change the law, acting as the elected representatives of   he sovereign people. ' Second, the executive department is to execute the law and carry it into effect. Third, the judicial department is to in- terpret the law, when required, and to give judgment under the law after judicial ex- amination, whether by jury trial or other- wise in the nature of the case. Now the judges of the court have held that without power to executc its judgments the court is impotent and ils judgment futile, and of none effect; therefore as necessary to that postulate the judges have assumed executive power. Under the guise of inter- pretation they have often assumed legisla- tive power as well, to set aside or annul en- acted law, or change its effect, or to make new law. That seems to be a simple his- toric fact. We have been blessed with good judges, in the main able and upright men, and those who have been incompetent or corrupt have been held in chcck by the others. Otherwise government of this re- public, under the theory of the courts, would long ago have degenerated into an intoler- able oligarchy. In present legal theory it is now, in the last analysis, a benevolent and righteous oligarchy of judges who, by man- damus or injunction or other process of court, may assume supreme executive or even legislative control. Dean Trickctt, of the Dickinson School of Law,a distinguished writer on legal sub- jects, in the North American Review of August 16, 1907, holds that it was not the intention, of the men who framed and adopted tlie Constitution to give power to the Supreme Court to nullify an act of Con- gress; but, having assumed that power, who is to take it away  Congress might repeal the act creating the Supreme Court, and the justices would, of course, go out of office immediately the repealer went into effect  unless they found the repealing act uncon- stitutional, which would crcatc an interesting situation indeed. However, while there appear to be plenty of theoretic dangers to freedom from the as- sumptions of the courts, there has yet been nothing seriously to excite alarm as to judi- cial encroachments, not only because judges are mostly righteous and able, hut also be- cause they have proved rather curiously amenable Lo general public sentiment. This hns been notably so in certain United States Supreme Court decisions; though it might have been expected that these justices, being appointed for life, would be even more re- moved from the influence of popular opin- A Frozen Brook ion than the elected judges. If it had n  t been tor this susceptibility of the courts to public sentiment, it is hard to think just what might have happened before now. So if jurymen have anv woes to com- plain of it may be quite unnecessary to appeal to the legislatures il they can enlist public interest on their side. Hut legis- lative action might, after all. be the shorter and easier method of reform. If il did nothing more il would bring the subject 1 .efore tin  public eye; especially, no doubt, if the courts should proceed to nullify the act of the legislature. II trial by jury has outgrown it  useful- ness, as some of the legal profession appear to think, by all means let us abolish it. But if il is actually -o important to liberty as we have been taught, surely Ihe c onditions under which il is applied to the well I joingof s. k it.-1 v ought lo be under constant and wall h- I ill m ru tiny: and anything which strengthens it' pi   we l  for got id ought to be of the liigl icst consideration, while whatever may weaken or hurt it is t   be sternly resented. hither uav it seems proper matter tor some seriousness, and for i a refill reflection.

Monsieur the Mar  iiis walked quickly on his way. I Iis wav lav along llie old rue de Manege that stretched llie length of the Jardin Xa- tional, I i11 lately the Jardin Royal des Tui leries.    n  e ordv did Monsieur the Mar- quis let his glam e drift across the snow v street to the erstwhile royal gardens. A look of tine disdain, of sombre rage, swept over his handsome lace, and withdrawing his gaze, looking neither in the right nor left, he walked Mill more quickly onward. As he neared the Church of the    ratory a -U'Men sound made him halt. lie knew on I v too well what il meant, and. leaning against the high iron railing, he waited with averted eyes for the tumbril to pass oil iis wav to the Place de la Cuillotine. When the wagon and il  burden had vanished down the darkening street, Mon- sieur the Marquis turned a wav and, with a passion ol rage and sorrow tearing at his heart, walked quickly on once more. A thousand thoughts irushed his brain, but the dominant one was that the last bond of duly and allegiance that bound him lo his unhappv   .'ountrv had -napped. Por llie lir-t time he felt himself free free to go as others had gone. He had scorned to lice, to take lip arms against his country with those noble renegades who had sneaked out ol Prance: his honor had demanded that he trust his country with his life and property. Put now, under the Terror, what life was safe for an instant, w hat properties beyond the rea  h of ihe lawless villains in power.-  He quickened his pace. He was glad now that he had sent his young brother Ramil out ol the i ountrv. The lad w as sale will  his tutor in Coblentz. As for himself, there w as no lime to lose now. lie must get out of the accursed country with his wife and child at the earliest possible moment, and when once they were in some safe re- treat, he would join the Prince de Conde s army in Coblentz. At the rue du Pont Ncuf he hesitated, lie felt that he could not see his wife just yet. he was too much agitated, and there were many things he must think over and decide before going to her. But time pressed hard, and after an instant s indeci- sion he turned to the right and, following the street t   the Ouay du Louvre, gained the Pont Xeuf. Midway the bridge he slopped once more, and. leaning against the parapet, stared out over the dark river. The cold night wind struck on his hot   hecks and forehead and  . leared his brain.    ld beliefs dropped from him. His illusions   rashed about his ears with the suddenness and confusion of a physical shock. He realized lor the tir t time that the greatest good can sometimes be the greatest wrong, and that lie, the soldier w ho had fought for American liberty and democracy under Lafayette, must now join the kingly force across the Rhine and tight for monarchy. At the thought of America his face once more da rkened. 11 is wile was an America n. The young 1- rench lieutenant who had gone to Amerii a to light had stayed to woo, and when the war was over and he sailed away to I ranee she, who had been the lovely Miss Henrietta King of Richmond, joyfully sailed with him.   W ould to  ',od I had left her safe in her peaceful America," he groaned, looking out over the turbulent   itv. As he looked, a throng of ragged men, bearing lighted torches that dripped lire, and brandishing reeking weapons, passed him, holding high in their midst a bloodv head on a pike. " This mad. terror-ridden city is no place for me and mine," thought Monsieur with a shudder, and turning he made his way to the rue 1  auphine, and so along the Boule- vard St.  iermain to the old rue de la I hi.- Return l lan  lu  where had stood fur generations I lie great mansion of the d' Utbignys.

I will do what I can is there anything -    Yes,  said d Aubigny, and putting down the child, he drew the man aside and spoke a few words to him in a low tone. Then he turned to his wife. " Riette,  he said,  it is unnecessary for me to tell you  v hat a summons before the Comile tie Saint Public means. So, instead of attempting any resistance, I have bargained with this gentleman here  a smile flickered for an instant over Monsieur's scornful lip  for a few thousand francs to be allowed to place you and the child in security what secur- ity there is in this accursed place,  he cried, blazing out into sudden wrath.  Some warm wraps for Madame and the child, quickly,  lie said, turning to the serving- woman who had stood transfixed with fear.  There is but little time these impetuous gentlemen will brook no delay,  and he smiled bitterly. Madame d Aubigny looked up at her husband.   I.et me stay with thee, Albert, go to prison, die with thee  What will life be without thee   she cried imploringly.  And the child   questioned d Aubigny sadly. She looked down at the boy.   Where art thou taking us   she asked faintly.  To the one asylum I know of in this doomed city to the American Legation, where I shall put thee and the child under the protection of our friend Monsieur Gouv- emeur Morris. He will not refuse me, I know ; and wrapping her in the warm cloak which the trembling servant had brought, he half led, half carried her and the child from the room, followed closely by Pellin and his men. The Legation in the rue de la Planche, but a short distance from the H6tel d Au- bigny, was alight, and Mr. Morris himself came out to greet them. He started back in amazement and alarm at sight of Ilenri- ette s pale, tear-stained face and the sol- diers who kept close to d Aubigny.   For God s sake, what has happened     he demanded.   I have been arrested and summoned to appear immediately before the Comitc  ie Saiut Public. As I know only too well what the outcome will be, I obtained the favor of bringing my wife and child to you for pro- tection, sure that you would not fail us,  and d Aubigny looked anxiously at Mr Morris.  Nor will I  God alone knows whether or not this spot will afford you protection, but I pledge you, d Aubigny, to do all 1 can for your wife and child. 1 have not vio- lated the neutrality of the Legation by in- viting you here, but now that you are comc, I will not refuse my aid, let the conse- quences be what they may    I knew I could count upon you   said d Aubigny, much moved.  I go to my death with a lighter heart now that I know they are in your care. What I most wish,  he went on hurriedly,  is that as soon as may be by the next boat, if possible  Henriette and Albert shall be sent back to America away from this accursed, terror- stricken France  Would to God I had never brought her to it  Later, perhaps, when the times are changed, they will comc back-  Henriette, who had stood silent during all this hurried interview as if in a trance of fear, suddenly turned to her husband, her face white and blazing with wrath.  Never   she cried,  Never  I re- nounce this country now and forever  Do you think I will return to this France which has murdered my husband, orphaned my child  Never   and she broke out into terrible sobs, echoed by the little Albert, who clung to her in terror.  Do not forget the boy is French, Ri- ette,  said d Aubigny. She put the weeping child down and sank to her knees at his feet.   He is not   she cried passionately, rais- ing her hand in anguished protest.   From this night forward I renounce his country for him  From this night he shall be of my land an American  I shall teach him to forget this wicked, blood-stained France, the people he has known and loved here, the very language he speaks  He shall re- member thee, only thee, Albert    and rising she flung herself into her husband s arms in an agony of passion and grief.   It shall be as thou dost wish, Ricttc,  said d Aubigny, very gently, looking down into her agonized face.   Give him this to remember his father and his father s people by,  and detaching a seal that hung from Die Return 90 the ribbon of his watch fob, In- handed it t    his wife. It was a richly wrought cin let of gold set with a  liece ol lapis lazuli of a won derful deep blue, in whic h was i arved the   rest of the d Aubignys: a   hcvmn nr be- tween three crescents argent, impaling a gryphon passant and the motto- Passcz him derail . There was a movement at the ........ and Pellin came forward.

I Tinki: had been a short, pelting rain  just enough to clear the air of a tom h of spring sultriness and to lay the dust on the asphalt pavement.--. The horse chestnuts glistened in the renewed brilliancy of the afternoon sunshine, and whiffs of fragrant moisture were wafted over high walls from concealed gardens. As Mrs. Dabney sped up the Champs Elysees in her Brazier motor she marvelled anew for the thousandth time at the alluring loveliness o  Pans, at the linisli and perfee tion of that capital of the world, so different from the crude wonderfulness of her native Chicago. It was her first trip abroad, although she was forty-six, and her husband was worth the comfortable sum from an American point of view of ten millions, all made by the manufacture and sale of "Dabney s Flour"- "high as the Himalayas in qualitv .  I hat she had not been to Europe before was entirely her own fault, for Mr Dabney was a typii al Americ an husband, generous and self-immolating to a fault It would have seemed to him a natural and appro- priate course of action had his wife and daughter elec ted to abandon him to his tin tiringcommer, ial activitiesand spend nun h of their time and his money abroad, but Mrs. Dabney was not a typical American wife, and it had been her fond and oft- repeated boast that she had never been away a day from her husband in the twenty- live years of their married life. I his somewhat appalling period ol lidel ity had had an end six months before when, by tin- urgent adviieol Mrs Melville Peek, the entreaties of her daughter, now twenty, in whom vciteilcs for the rue de la Paix were beginning to -.tir. and the enthusiastic consent ol her husband, she had engaged the best slate rooms on board the Kron- firinzcssni Inihi and sailed for Genoa.    1 iour.se Mrs. Melville Pei I; went with them a-i their guest. That ladv had a way ol making herself so invaluable to friends about to start on foreign trips that she invariably ended by accompanying them at their expense. To Mrs. Dabnev, her friend s frequent journeys abroad and knowing attitude toward the small Paris- ian shops, unheard of bv the vast body of louring Amerii ins, for whom only the Bon Man lie and the Magasins du Louvre exist commercially, coupled with the authenti- cated fact that she had twice been enter- tained at the country houses of English aristocracv, made her seem a person pro loundly versed in buropean experiences. Il was not, therefore, astonishing that Mr.-.. Dabnev and her daughter ceaselessly con- gratulated themselves on having secured Mrs. IV, k as a travelling companion, espe- cially since she had undeniably engineered her friends  continental tour from the first with no small amount of skill and success. Their man Ii on Paris in a sixty-horse- power Brazier bv way of the Italian Ri  ier.i, Rome, Florence, and Geneva, had been a sip   e.-oion of small social conquests. Wherever they went they left behind them a verv distinct impression of unlimited u ealth and a number   if highly desirable ac- quaintances. I ndoubtedly the most notable of these had been a voung 1 reni.h nobleman, the Marquis Raoul d'Aubigny. Just how such a brilliant luminarv had swung into their orbit Mrs. Dabney scarcely knew. As the untrained eve is blind to the revelations of the microscope, so Mrs. Dabney's un- disciplined social instincts ignored those subtle processes by which Mrs. Peck had attrac ted the young Marquis and attached him to her party. That he was attracted and attached was amplv obvious, and with that net result Mrs. Dabney was entirely contented. Her daughter, as the one most dircctlv interested, also seemed contented with the situation, and allowed the young I he ket urn i m 11 ........       i .11 i Ii - rn   i Ii ;  j n  c- i..

I have been away quite a while, you know.    Yes,  assented the girl calmly, but she looked at d Aubigny curiously. Something different in his appearanee and manner had struck her from the first moment of meet- ing at the hotel entrance. He sat opposite her on one of the numerous gilt fauteuils the salon boasted, and in the full radiance of the afternoon sun. By the clear light she noted that the genial, youthful expression of his face had given place, to a tired, har- assed look, just as the former gay sponta- neity of manner had vanished in favor of a ratheT constrained attitude. Suddenly the girl leaned forward. '  What is the matter you don't look well,  she said impulsively. The young man pushed back his blonde hair from his forehead with a nervous gesture. " Oh, I m all right,  he declared. "I'm just a bit tired discussing so many things with my mother. You see, in France, the young even young men are not free agents they must accept advice, be dic- tated to, submit in most cases even when their views differ radically, and my mother is a very determined woman. Understand me,  he went on hastily,   we are the best of friends, and she is a wonderful woman; but sometimes, of course, wc have different ideas.  He paused, and then added hope- fully as he bent rsver her white hand of which he had possessed himself,   but every thing will, must come out all right 1  The young girl drew back in some con- fusion, and d Aubigny sprang to his feet as Mrs. Dabney entered she had disappeared a moment after reaching the salon with the amiable consideration of the American mother who realizes to the full and without bitterness that visiting young men come to see her daughters, and not herself. She was accompanied by Mrs. Melville Peck, and fol- lowed almost immediately hy servants with the tea service. In the general conversation which fol- lowed there could, of course, be no recur- rence to the note of intimacy between d Au- bigny and Miss Dabney, and the young girl could only sit silent, wondering per- plexedly what had happened to so evidently disturb him, and Jetting the two older ladies make the conversetion.  We are charmed with your city  Mrs. Dabney and Nettie here can t get enough of it, indefatigable sight-seers though they are,  declared Mrs. Peck to the young man in a pause of the rather perfunctory talk.   It s too simply exquisite  Nettie and I spent hours in the Louvre yesterday I don t mean the Magasins   Mrs. Dabney smiled archly and knowingly,  and if we could have had our poor tired feet 'restored  like the statues, we would have stayed there the rest of the day.  D 'Aubigny smiled. When it comes to   doing   Paris, as you say, one finds it rather overwhelming. I am hoping you will allow me to show you some of the sights of my native city,  he added, looking at Miss Dabney. " How very kind of you  We shall he de- lighted.    It is doubly kind, because there are certain things we can t see without you, my dear Marquis,  interjected Mrs. Peck adroitly. For example   asked the young man somewhat bewildered.  Oh,I mean all the fascinating,old part of Paris, the Faubourg part that undis- covered country of the tourist that you keep shut up, out of sight behind high walls. I know we are welcome, to your museums and galleries and the big hotels and cafes and theatres all this vast, glittering part of Paris that wc can help pay for but what we want to see is the other part the part we can't buy   The young man met this with a bow and a gleam of amusement in his eye at the lady s astuteness; but as he gazed thought- fully at the tip of his glossy boot, it seemed to Miss Dabney that the slightly harassed look on his face deepened.   Ah, that would be very easy,  he finally declared pleasantly.  My mother and sister are impatient to make your acquaint- ance, and I hope I may shortly have the honor of showing you ladies my home, which happens to be in the part of Paris you desire to see, and perhaps you will be good enough to consider it as fairly typical.  "My dear Marquis, how deLightful " Mrs. Dabney s easily aroused enthusiasm made of this little cry a piean of praise, I In   1   111n i while Mrs. Pet k murmured .1 pleased ac ceptance in .1 lower key. "I will call lor you ii   ni.iv," -..1 i   11u- voung man as lie rose to go with .1 compre hensive bow that iin luded tin- three    t. - morrow alternoon at live." 11 It was with an almost solemn pleasure that the two older ladies made ready the following afternoon fur their lirst iiuursion into the tern iinoiiiim i i the Faubourg.  s for the young girl, her se  ret perturllations made ol the occasion a rather tearful joy. She could :iot conceal Irom herself that the visit was fraught with la rge pi  ssibilities. and it was with an access    1 ner   msness entirelv foreign to her usual self-suiVu ieno that she found herself at the entrance to the Hotel d Aubigny in the old rue do la Planche. Monsieur d Aubigny was obviously anx ious also, but Mrs. Dabnev w as far t' m abs  rbed in ji y  us anticipations t" be cap i hie ol feeling anything so personal as ner vousness. As the motor turned in through the big iron gates that s  ung between tlicir carved stone pillars her antic ipations, how - ever, were swallowed Lip in amazement at the reality presented     her view. The old garden stretching its length in formal rows parallel w ith the high 111    -0 walls that   om- pletely enclosed it: the modest chateau, al most invisible from the ijuiet street, rearing its undistinguished facade above a small court yard whereon pointed turrets threw tapering sliadi  ws in the afternoon sunshine, formed a j i  ture sadly at variance with her preconceived iileas ol the ar  111tec tural splendors of the Faubourg and the naked opulenc e of familiar I.ake Shore residences. If the unpretentious exterior of the Hotel d'Aubigny had plunged her in amazement, the richness and taste of the interior, to which she was introdut ed   n the threshold, astonished her equally, from the great en trance hall, with its stairway and balus trade carved in writhing salamanders a portion of the chateau dated Irom the time 11I Francis I- they passed into a salon ol noble proportions, at the l.ir end o  whii ii sat Madame d Aubignv in solitary, but ob viously accustomed, state. Mrs. Dabney could never alterward re call just what her uninformed idea o  a French countess of the old order had been. but certainly tin.- reality as presented to her in I he person ol M a da me d A ubigny did not tally with her expectations, Madame d  11bigny was tall and thin, with an an- gular I hinness that 1 01 ild -  an eh be termed aristocratic, and her 1 lot lies were such as went lar to excuse the ill 1 urn ealcd amaze- ment o  the  11ieri1 an ladies. But when one noted the steady gleam of the line, dark eyes, the lirm cut of lip and jaw, one easily divined that, alter all, Madame d'Aubigny might iie a personage. She retched her visitors with a   onsum mate dignity and aloofness 1  1" manner w hich were calculated lo 1 hill the warmth of any Li Hi onsidcred advances as effei tuallv as an ii e-pai k reducesa fever, and which con veyed to the astute intelligent e of Mrs. Pei k, at least.. 1 hint of the reltn tani e w itli wliii hshe had 1 oiisented to receive her son's friends.

Although she was conscious oi a scarcely veiled an- tagonism in Llie attitude of Madame d'Au- l.iignv, her bearing was as gravely dignified and unembarrassed as that of her hostess. The nervousness which she had felt 011 en- tering had dropped from her. and in the great rooms of the Hotel d Aubigny she felt herselt inexplii ably at ease. Looking at her, the young man told himself he had never seen her beaut  to such an advantage. It was a  if she were some gem w hit h had suddenly lound a pefleet setting. In the felicity of his emotions he exerted himself to the utmost to dispel his mother's reserve toward his guests, but without much success, and it was with undisguised relief that he saw the door open and his sister advance into the room. Madame la Baronne de  iucret. a small blonde, lial ituallv dressed in the height of the prevailing lashion. resembled her mother onlv in being thin, but was aston- ishingly like ln r brother in face and man- ner. She was one   l the c 1 'iiicipi'c young Parisian matrons, going i.i I t "Ir  fwrt," and en i1  ying hersell trcmcncli itslv w Iterever  The Return 105 she went. She rather affected American so ciety, and greeted her brother s visitors cordially. With this younger lady Nettie Dabney immediately felt on friendiy terms, while Madame de Gueret on her part re- garded the American girl with a somewhat quizzical interest that betrayed a sympa- thetic knowledge of her brother's affairs apparently as yet unshared by his mother.  My brother speaks much of you,  she murmured to the young girl under cover of the desultory talk going on at the other end of die table where tea was being served. Miss Dabney colored slightly.  He has been most kind and useful, too,  she re- turned. Useful  Usefulness is scarcely Raoul's distinguishing characteristic,   exclaimed Madame de Gueret, and she .smiled an amused smile. " My mother and I have a talent for get- ting ourselves into difficulties while trav- elling, and on several occasions Monsieur d Aubignv has come to our aid.   Ah, I can understand that that, would give him great pleasure,  murmured Ma- dame de Gueret   ordy I had thought that travelling could present no difficulties to Americans.  " It is our first trip abroad,  said the girl stiffly. For some reason which she did not stop to analyze, she felt impelled to explain herself fully to Madame de Gueret the most superficial piece of reticence suddenly seemed impossible to her overstrained per- ceptions.  I have never been in Paris or in a French home bo fore,  she added with gratuitous cxplicitness.   But that is delightful-   cried Madame do Gueret rising. "Raoul,  she called lo her brother, Miss Dabney has never seen a French infer ten r. Let us show her the house and gardens. 1 As the little party passed from one nobly proportioned apartment to another, up the famous cscalicr, and through the great gal- lery that ran the width of the house and gave upon the court-yard, the admiration of the American ladies found expression jn staccato exclamations of surprise and de- light. Even to tlicir undisciplined senses the artistic coherency of the Hotel d Aubig ny so different from that gay catholicity of taste to which they were accustomed and which revels in the juxtaposition of  Louis Seize   draw ing-rooms and Moorish lounges Vol. XLVII 13 behind a Georgian exterior appealed pow- erfully, and the gardens into which they pres- ently emerged, and which had, on entering, struck them as lacking size and brilliancy, now seemed the suitably sober complement of the chaste loveliness of the house within. Into the subdued richness of this picture the old Marquise d'Aubigny fitted per- fectly. To the American girl, watching her with astonished and observant eyes, it oc- cured forcibly that it would be a mental impossibility lo disassociate her for an in- stant from her surroundings. For the first time the young girl realized what it meant to be the descendant of an old house, the representative of a great family. It was as though all the historical associations with which the house teemed were visibly at- tached to one person as though the long shafts of light sent down from an imme- morial past were focusscd on one head. She had die stinging sensation of being her- self incredibly detached and modem, and in the moment of her illumination she saw with disconcerting dearness her own posi- tion and the inevitable attitude of Mon- sieur d Aubiguy s family in the event of her marriage to him. Even the great dot which she coidd bring would not temper the severity of that attitude, as the d Au- bignys were obviously wealthy, as wealth goes in France. But if the girl was troubled by these re- flections, she gave no sign, and Madame de Gueret, watching her in amused amaze- ment, pronounced her a miracle of adapt- ability. And nowhere did she seem more at ease, more her usual beautiful young self, than in the great salon lined with portraits of dead and gone d Aubignys, to which they presently returned from the garden. There, if anywhere, thought Ma- dame de Gueret, this young American girl would feel impressed by the traditions and glory of her family. Perhaps it was with some faintly amused idea of bringing it home to her that, as the two older ladies still lingered over their wraps, she mur- mured ail invitation to the young girl to make a tour of the room with her. She stopped before the marble chimney- piece.  That," she said, looking up ai the great portrait which hung above it,   is one of our ancestors who led a charge at Fon- tenoy under the Marcchal Saxe. It was to him the King gave the estates we still hold I hr ki t urn in 'I i uraine. I have always wished I had known him   I like Iii- look.' " The girl looked at the jn  rirai 1. "Sm n I,   she sail I. smiling. " I nit I think I like i his gentleman's c cn belter,  ami she turned t   a portrait hanging near tin-        r above a small Clouet.

Madame de  itieret followed the young girl s glam e "   mi should do no li s,  she declared gavly, "for he liked Americans so well that lie married one.

Mrs Peck looked at the young man with an imperceptible smile. "But does it re- ijuire aiiv special bravery to marry the woman vou love.-'" DUtliignv turned on her a glance of stored belligerent v.   In this country yes," he said shortly. Madame d Aubigny laid a reconciling hand on the voting man s shoulder.

" We like to see our sons marrv the daughters of our friends, young girls who have been brought up with the same viewpoint, the same education, the same social position, who will help them to fit- tingly uphold the traditions of their house.  Her manner was rather that of a Spanish CoiHjHcsttuforc repulsing a foreign invasion. But suddenly she glanced at the American girl, and the aggressive look vanished and one almost of appeal t ame into the tlark eyes. "We French do not like changes, innova- tions. vve i ling to our customs, our family associations, and we essav to perpetuate them at all costs- i.an you understand   At the unspoken appeal the girl's whole manner suddenly changed, and she came lorvvard smiling brilliantly.

She was not astonished at his resentment, but she was astonished at his prompt action  the firm request he made of Mrs. Dab- ney, as the ladies stepped into the wailing motor, for an interview at eleven the next morning, and the formal proposal by letter for Miss Dabney s hand which rcachcd Mis. Dabney lhat evening. The young man s precipitancy earned with it the seal of Mrs. Peck s approval, and she instantly applied herself to finding a solution of the sufficiently exasperating problem confronting her friends. The result of her deliberations was a surprise and disappointment for Monsieur d Aubigny, for on calling punctually at the hotel the following morning for his an- swer, with intentions steeled by a stormy interview with his mother, he found only a hastily written line by Mrs. Dabney, ap- prising him of the fact that they had been suddenly called to England, and would not be in Paris again until the autumn, when her husband would have arrived from America and would give Monsieur d'Au- bigny an answer to his proposal of marriage. To this delay and check to his advances the young man submitted with a3 good grace as he could muster, determining to employ the period of his probation for such he deemed it in preparing his mother for the inevitable. It was a tribute to Miss Dabney that, even in the first flush of his disappointment, no doubt of her Loyalty added bitterness to his thoughts. With the lover s divine intuition he knew that she cared for him and that the flight across the Channel had been, for some inscrutable reason, the decision of the astute Mrs. Peck. When reason had finally triumphed over feeling, he even acknowledged to himself that the enforced separation was not an unmitigated evil. It would oiTe" Nettie Dabney the opportunity lo relegate to a somewhat mellowed past the memory of her visit to the Hotel d Aubigny, and give him time, in the vulgar phrase, to get his second wind he realized that he had been a little breathless since bis encounter with his mother. From the first, there bad been scant room for regret in his thoughts-that the lady of his choice had not been of his Own land anti social position, and latterly, in the mounting ardor of his emotions, such heresies had become even unthinkable, but Vol. XLV1I. 13 i he realized to the full two important facts  his mother s deep-rooted prejudices against a marriage outside of their own social order and the paramount importance, from his point of view, of reconciling her to that marriage. He wisely concluded that the summer offered none too much time for combating these prejudices and effecting that recon- ciliation, III It was mid-Octobcr before the Dabneys and Mrs. Peck returned to Paris. D Au- bigny read the announcement in a belated afternoon paper simultaneously with the arrival of a note from Mrs. Dabney telling him of their return and inviting him to tea at five the following afternoon. The news and hospitable tenor of Mrs. Dabney s note elated him inexpressibly. He had not real- ized on what a tension he had lived during the last four months until it broke. The self-control which had been strong enough to hold him far fTom the lady of his heart for so long snapped like a thread under the strain of her nearness. Twenty-four hours seemed an eternity, and in a tempest of joy- ous emotion he resolved to s;o straight to her. A half-hour later his brougham was disput- ing the entrance of the hotel with a travel- stained Brazier that had crowded in just before him. In the elevator d Aubigny found himself in the company of an American, as he knew instantly, whose goggles, motor coat, and portmanteau, carried by the obsequious bell-boy, dustily proclaimed him the owner of the touring car. This gentleman alighted au troisi Hic, too, and proceeded with swift strides down the corridor. D Aubigny, fol- lowing at a more leisurely pace, reached the door of Mrs. Dabney s apartment just as it was opened to the stranger. To his aston- ishment he saw Mrs, Dabney herself hover- ing expectantly behind the servant, and be- fore he could efface himself she had fallen upon the neck of the tall stranger and at the same instant had caught sight of d'Aubigny. Laughing, she disengaged herself and ad- vanced to the young man with outstretched hand. He would have declined to be a fur- ther witness to the return of the husband and father had not a sight of Miss Dabney in the background, emerging from the drawing- room, caused his tactful resolution, to waver. 10S The Return After all, why shouldn t he take his imme- diate chance   It struck him as rather sym- bolic that he and the arbiter of hisfate should have arrived at the same instant. The fur- ther advent at that moment of Mrs. Peck, to whose instance he felt he owed the long delay of the summer, settled the thing, and he mentally declined, in haste, to clear out either literally or figuratively. The wisdom of this masterful decision was confirmed by the cordiality of Mr. Dab- ney s manner. That gentleman evinced neither embarrassment nor irritation at d Aubigny s somewhat inopportune arrival, but, on learning the young man's name, de- clared himself uncommonly glad to see him. The frank gaze of Mr. Dabney s shrewd eyes, the kindly smile lurking around the large firm lips, the whole uncomplicated directness of the man, as of one who was used to calling a spade a spade and had a habit of going undeviatingly to the point, so instantly impressed d Aubigny that he did not even feel a shock of surprise when Mr. Dabney, seating himself with a humor- ous carefulness on one of the insecure gilt chairs scattered prodigally about the salon, leaned forward and said:   So you re the young man who wants to marry Nettie     I am.  To his astonishment Monsieur d Aubigny found himself replying with a di- rectness as unequivocal as his interlocutor s.  Ah     I had the honor of proposing for your daughter s hand   the young man hesi- tated and glanced in some embarrassment past Mr. Dabney to where his daughter sat on a gilt canape between her mother and Mrs. Peck. Mr. Dabney smiled his large, slow smile.  That s all right,  he commented.  We don t keep these things from our girls in fact, it s generally the girls who break the news to us if they think it wise for us to know   He chuckled audibly.  Besides, I haven t had a chance to talk this over with my wife. I ve just got here by the steamer, so we d best do it right here and now. You were saying-     That I had the honor of proposing for your daughter s hand in May.  Mr. Dabney extracted a large, dark cigar from a leather case and rolled it thought- fully between his fingers.   I don t know much about the customs of this country, but I was under the impression that the parents arranged these matters over here.  The young man Hushed to the roots of his fair hair.  It is true but my father died many years ago, and my mother there were rea- sons   he broke off hurriedly.   Mrs. Dab- ney led me to hope that I was to have an an- swer on her return to Paris. I have waited as patiently as I could all summer,  he ad- ded, smiling, after an instant s hesitation.   Yes, yes. It certainly is hard to be kept wailing for an answer all summer, and I can easily understand that any young man who has taken a fancy to Nettie  he looked appreciatively over at his beautiful daughter   might get impatient. But, you see, my wife hardly knew what to do about your proposal of marriage. So Mrs. Peck here Mrs. Peck ought to have been a politician  advised her to waive the issue for the time being leave that plank out of her platform temporarily and wait for me to straighten out the whole thing. That s a way American women have of doing, and it s a mighty good way, too. What s the American man made for, anyway     But I don t think I understand   haz- arded the young man.  Well, my wife did   interjected Mr. Dabney humorously.   Saw right through your letter to the objections behind it. And she knew just w'hat those objections were. It wasn t the dot question we ve got used to the dot and carry one system in America, thanks to the international alliance; but this time it was the   family attitude.    The young man moved uneasily in his seat.   Your mother now she must have made it pretty clear what she thought of plain Americans without titles didn t think we were quite good enough for her, wasn t that it  didn t care for the ancient and honor- able house of d Aubigny to get mixed up with American democracy     But,  burst out d Aubigny,  my moth- er s ideas are not mine  She has old- fashioned notions, prejudices, that have be- come obsolete even in our class. But as for me, I think of nothing but that I love your daughter and want her to marry me   The big American rose slowly and stretched out a large, capable hand.   That s all I wanted to know,  he said, and he beamed upon the young man. Monsieur d Aubigny, rising also, ac- I lie Return 109 cepted the profiiied hand   lasp. "Then perhaps you will In:  o,   enough in till me what 1 am sn anxious to know whether I may have the great happiness and honor   f making Miss Dabne  Marquise d An bigny v " Mr. Dabney looked down at ihe young man with a sort nf regretful affe  tion.  But that, my l  iy," lie said,  is just what y m can't do. 11 isn't in your    .er.  The young Frenchman looked blankly at Mr. Dabney. "What makes you say that he asked when he could speak. "Because, my dear lcllnw, 1 am the Marquis d'Aubigny mysell." The young man stared in  redulously. For a bewildered instant he wondered if the man before him were mad. Mr. Dabney waved him ba  I; to his i hair. "Vou aren t an  more astonished than I was when 1 found il out a month ago.  He spoke soothingly.  Sit down and 1 11 tell you all about it in a couple of min- utes.   He took from a capacious inner pocket a large flat envelope, Irom whit h lie drew a crackling paper, and held it out to d'Aubigny.

In live days he de-   ised, wrote, rehearsed am 1 produced a com - edy-hallet, "L Amour Medecin,  which was acted before the King at Versailles in the middle of September, 1 065. and brought out at the Palais Royal a feu days later. It was ill prose and 111 I hree acts, but by omil- lillg the interludes of dancing it could be presented easily as a single act. In this merry trifle, inipro ised liastih al the 111011- ai' h sde.-jire, Moliere returned lothefamil- i ir and convenient framework of the coni- cdy-of-m.i4.s. Thecu lion takes place in the open air in Iront of the house of Sganarcl c. The plot of the little play is as simple as may be; but however slight in texture il i.-- si 111:  i  nt for its immediate purpose. Moliere himself appeared as .SVa Hi   r  r, not here the shrewd servant  4 ".Don Juan.  but the more narrow-minded and obstinate type seen earlier in the '' h 1 ole des Maris.  He is now a widower with one daughter, l.iuinde  probably impersonated by Mile. Moliere . The father wishes to keep his daughter for himself, but the daughter de- sires to be married to a young man who has sought her hand, Clilaiidre  acted by La Grange . She pretends to be ill; and Sganarclle seeks advice, lirst from various friends, and finally from four physicians, called in consultation upon her ease. The doctors disagree, and two of them, after pro- posing radically different treatments, quar- rel violently. A little later the maid brings in Clilaitdrc disguised as a physician. The young h  verdeceives the father into consent- ing to his daughter s marriage, Sgannrclle supposing that this is only a pretence, likely to arouse l.urindr out of her melancholy. When he discovers that she is really wedded to C ihindrc the play is over. This unpretending little farce, significant only as an example   f Moliere s fertility and facility, is brisk and lively in iis move- ment. It was probably effective enough on the stage when performed by Moliere and his comrades; and it is in the theatre that its merits would be most evident. In the preface, wherein the author explained that the piccc was written to order at top- most speed, Moliere modestly asserted that it contained much which was dependent chiefly on the skill of the performers. And he added a remark characteristic of the Moliere anti tl 10 Doctors professional playwright who has planned his work for the ailnal llicaln :   I  i i s one knows that comedies an: w ritien only t   he acted.  Blit the inten-si ul this amusing lililc piece when it was lirst performed  li I not lie in the adroitness of the a  ling   r in the humorous ingenuity of its situations; it resided lather in llie four physi  ians who meet in Consultation.

This was an Aristophanic license of personal caricature, which is here without offence or ill-will, for Moliere was not attacking the persons or t he c ha rat ter "I 1 liese   ihysicians. He was using them only as the means of showing up the hollowness of tin- preten- sions of the w hole medical profession ot his own day. II 11 was in   Don Juan" that M- 'Iii-re had first girded at the practitioners of the heal- ing art. When I 011 Juan and S aiianllr had to disguise themselves, the latter ap pea red in the flowing robe of a physiiian, giving his master an onasion tor a few Biting jibes against the doctors; and this shocked S aiuirrl r, horrified lo lind that Don Juan, a sceptic in religion, w as also a sceptic in medicine. It was in " L'. ni"ur Medecin  that Moliere lirst declared open war against the la  ully, that guerilla war- fare which he was to keep up for the rest oi his life, returning to the atta  k in play after   day, as though he was as I  itier against I he doc tors as he was against the    edants and l he hypocrites. 'I'heexplanatii n of this Inislility is to he found in the fact that Moliere held the physicians of hi.-- time to Beboih pedants and hypocrites. For affectation in all its phases, for pretenders of even- kind, lor humbugs of all sorts. Moliere had a keen eye and a hearty detestation. On them and on them only he was ever swift to p  air the vials of his wrath; and he was never moved lo as- sault unless his hostile contempt was awak ened by his acute instinct for a sham. 111 e  en   icrioi I l lu re a re   erlain i a 1 lings, or professions, as the iase may be, w hit h tlii- average man of that epoi h delighls in abusing; and we are not lo-da  s.'  liter to make tun ol the plumber than the people of the Middle Ages were to   rai k jokes at the expense of the miller 'l lie soun e of the irritation wlin h tInis seeks vent in humor- ous thrusls is the same: it i- the result of onr knowledge of the fait that we lanuol control the aiiounls rendered by the mil- ler and l.i% the plumber.

Hosts of merry jests, directed at tlie con- ceit of the members, ol these tw o professions have been handed down from century to ceuturv, or are born again by spontaneous g  iteration.

Behind this they intreni lied themselves, and in defence oi I his 11 iey were prepared to die in the last dil  h and to let llieir patients die also. l;i Paris the Faculty of Medicine was a   osv corporation, bound together by the loyal traditions of a trade-gild an  1 possess- ing a solidarity more substantial than that oi anv modern trades-union. There were only aboii  a hundred   ihvsit ians in the capi- tal and not more than four were admitted ia any one year. The cost of a medical education was onerous, and therefore, the proles.don was recruited from the well-to- do. At the examination  spei ial privileges w ere granted t   the sons of physicians; and the profession thus tended to be hereditary with all llie obvious disadvantages of per- sistent inbreeding.

'J he doctors were generally more in le it Mci I in medii ine as a i ode oi t rad i non, and in their ow u strit t obedience to iis f rc- cepts and precedents than they were in the art of healing and in the condition of the individual patient. They were indeed far more conservative than the ancients whom tliev bound themselves lo follow; and  lie oath of Hippocrates had a large liberality whit Ii was I.it king in the pledge subscribed by the young doctor in Paris, which was little more than a promise ever to defend sturdilv the rights of the Faculty itself. The doctors oi the capital rejected the circulation of the blood, so we are told bv one historian ol medii ine in Franc e, be- cause 11 ii s came from Fngland. and also the use of antimony and      quinine, because one came from Montpellier and the other from America. Il refused to have any- thing w hatever to do v ith surgery, which it despised; and students of medicine were not allowed to dissect. The phvsicians held surgery to be a mere manual art, un- worlhv ol a learned prolession. Anv phy- sician who had ever prat lised surgery was required to promise that he would never again descend to i hi-  craft lit only for an artisan. There were numberless other ab- surdities accepted by nearly all the phy- sicians of the time. Weeding and purging were, c 1 course, llie foremost ol remedies, sinc e they were necessary to rid the body of its  humors." Patients took medicine or were purged not only for any ailment they had, but also for the ailments they might have in the future, mcrelv as a p recall lit inary measure. And lo these ridiculous prac- tices every one who consulted a physician had to submit, including the King himself. Ill Si c i these absurdities anti artificialities were patent to all. Moliere could not help seeing them. He was moved to mirthful indignation bv the cm  lv prelensic ns of the physicians. He might not know belter than any other layman what ought to be done; but he was loo sharp-sighted and keen w iitei I not It i see that these things ought not be done. Here, as elsewhere, he had an abiding faith in the power of nature to take care of itself and to work out its ow n salvation. This led him to abbm  the end- less purging, bleeding, and drugging which every physician then resorted to. It led him Moliere and the Doctors also to anticipate tin- modern practice nf letting a disease run its i nurse. In " I.A nv ur Medec in " the nimble-tongued I iwttc tells how the houselmlil iat has recovered from a fall into I lit- street, after lviug three days without eating and without moving a paw; and then she adds that there are no eat physicians, luckily for the cat, or ii would have ilie l fmni their purging , and bleedings. A similar attitude is taken I.%  other i liarac ters in the later plavs, in which Moliere returned again tn the attack. Moliere had had thorough instru  linn in the otticial philosophy, as the lesuits im parted it to their students; and lie- had been made familiar with a more modern school ol thought by Gassendi. 1 le was bv train ing lit ted to understand the philosophic foundation nil whic h were raised .ill the theories promulgated by the Faculty of Medicine; and bis nbjeetion t   the prac- tices of the French physicians nf his time seems t   be due not more In the absurdity of these practices than t . the absurdity nf the philosophy which justified them lie did his own thinking in his nwn fash- ion; and he was nn blind worshipper of authority, lie was not overawed bv tin- revered name ol 1 lippnerates, outside nl which there was nn health. Fvcu the i iting of Aristotle was n  t tn him conclusive ii" his own eyes revealed in him an experience nnt nbvinuslv in accord with the saying ..I the great Greek. It is not without signili- cance that he' makes one; of his   lianu ters dec Lire that   the atu ients are the anc ients, and we are the men of to-day." Moliere was no iconc clast. no violent roveilutionary, no rejector of tradition snlelv because it was an inheritance.    n the other hand, he was ready to prove all things so that he might hold fast that whic h was gond. Sn it was that he detested vain theorizing and the building up of formulas and   t classi- fications into rigid svslems. I also to I lie l.u Is of life as he saw them with his own eyes. The medic ine of his day w as a rigid system of this sort; and the moment he perceived this clearly he could not help exposing it. But his detestation ol tile contemporary perversions ol the doctrines ol Hippocrates and of Galen did not lead him to misrepre- sent them.    n the contrary, lie strove to reproduce them with the- most conscientious accuracy. If the disc ussions nf his doc - tors, their dissertations, their disputations seem to us almost im mu ci ;iblv ndic li I - oiis. this is bei a use Moliere had assimilated the theory I h.11 sustained them and had absorbed the voc abiil.irv in vv hie h they were habitually set inrth I'o bring forth abundant laughter all that Moliere had to do was lo  ,  ow the doctors in .n lion, to isolate this prim iple and that, and In I this Inrl11 in their . .vv n jargon, with onK llie slight heightening no cssarv to make- il i lear.

The only favor that Moliere ever . raved fn .ni the sc ivereign was I ha I a vacant canon rv might be bestowed on Mauvillain's son. This request lie addressed to the King on 114 From an Automobile the joyful day when Louis XIV at last per- mitted the public performances of uTar- tufie.  In his apj eal he lold the monarch that the physician had promised and was ready Lo bind himself, under oalli, to keep his patient alive for thirty years if this Loon could be obtained from the King. The pe- titioner explained that he had not demand- ed so much, and he would be satisfied if the doctor merely promised not to kill him. Grimarest has recorded that the King once asked Moliere how he got along with his physician, ajid that the dramatist an- swered, "Sire, we talk together; he pre- scribes remedies for me; I do not take them; and I get well.  These talks together were probably the source of Moliere s accurate and intimate acquaintance with the principles, the pro- cedure, and the vocabulary of contempo- rary medicine. Mauvillain was a man of marked individuality, who had had troubles of his own in his youth, hut who rose in time lo ke dean of the Faculty. Ardent de- fender of the rights of hiss guild, he seems to have had a sense of humor; and it may be that he took a malicious pleasure in sup- plying Moliere with material for caricatur- ing other members of the Faculty and even the Faculty itself. Moliere s uncertain health must often have given occasion for these talks with Mauvillain; and although he may have told the King that he did not take the remedies his physician prescribed, it is a fact that when he died he owed a heavy bill to his apothecary. That his health was uncer- tain is beyond all question. His lungs were weak, and he had a chronic cough, which he even gave as a peculiarity to one of the later characters he wrote for his own acting. He came of a feeble stock; his mother died young and few of her children attained long life. Molifere s younger brother died be- fore he did- and he himself was to survive only until he was fifty-one, the immediate cause of his death being the rupture of a blood-vessel in the lungs. Two of his three children died before him; and his only surviving child, a daughter, died at last without leaving issue. It is only after he became conscious that his health was failing and that he had to call on physicians for relief, it is only then that he began to make fun of them, after he had had personal experience of the futility of their efforts. Perhaps we may find the exciting cause of his hostility Lo the contem- porary practice of medicine in the inability of the contemporary practitioners to allevi- ate his own ailments and to restore him to strength. A fact it is that he continued his attacks on them to the end of his life, and that the last play he lived to produce, the " Malade Imaginaire  contained the most vigorous of all his assaults, far more search- ing than the comparatively mild satire of  L Amour Mcdecin,  FROM AN AUTOMOBILE By Percy Mac Kaye F'luid the world flowed under us: the hills, Billow on billow of umbrageous green, Heaved us, agbast, to fresh horizons, seen One rapturous instant, blind with flash of rills And silver rising storms and dewy stills Of dripping boulders, then die dim ravine Drowned us again in leafage, whose serene Coverts grew loud with our tumultuous wills.

I suppose you see more of such things in the East,  he began.  I ve never been there. But the East isn t the only place you see them. They re just nearer the sur- face there, like like a rock in quick water, where the currents divide.  Hallock, the writer man, looked up in quick appreciation of the figure.  The currents of life, in this case,  he suggested.  That s it a rock dividing the currents of life. It was last fall that I saw how this romance had ended or, rather, how it had continued, for I found Billy Hendricks and his wife living in a clearing not far from the upper waters of the Montreal. They have a comfortable log house there, with roses and wallflowers and other things you don t expect to see in the woods growing about it. In the house are books and pictures; the books mostly essays and poetry, for Mrs. Hendricks has never reverted enough to lose her fondness for such things.   Reverted -   queried Hallock.   Yes. At least that's the way 1 explain it, though I shouldn t wonder if it was more than that something you can't explain. The beginning of it was four years ago last October. Tom Douglass and his wife had leased an island in Temagami, and gave a house party there. They called it a camp- ing party, but the name seemed odd to me; fresh milk and eggs from the station every day, and vegetables two or three times a week. It was a house party without a house, and a mighty pleasant one, with a congenial crowd of men and girls. You know what a match- maker Mrs. Tom is; I expect she hoped to pair us all off in those two weeks. Only one of the girls, Helen Mack vicar, seemed to be- long in the woods, and it looked from the first as if she and Billy Hendricks would hit it off. She looked like an Indian, with herstraight,dark hair and aquiline features. I could hardly believe it when Mrs. Doug- lass told me she came from New York. It seemed as if she didn t belong there at all. And Hendricks, too, was out of the usual run -different somehow. He is an honorary chief of the Chippewas, you know, and lived among them for years.   One night we all went for supper to a cove in Devil's Bay, not far from Kokomis Island, meaning to paddle back by moon- light. There is a stone on the island that looks remarkably like a little old woman, seated. The Indians say that she is Ko- komis, the Devil s wife, whom he turned to stone agesago, and put on the island. When the brigades start out from the Hudson Bay Company s post, in the September moon, thej' stop a night near Kokomis, and make offerings to herof tobacco and flour and tea, and ask her lo give  hem good hunting. The priests can t stop them, though a priest is generally big medicine to an Indian.   Hendricks and Helen Mackvicar lagged away behind the rest on the way to the cove. Supper was nearly ready, and the sun was red over Obahika before their canoe touched the rocks. I was at the shore when they came, and it didn t take a hawk s eye to see that something had happened. Hen- dricks hauled out the canoe, and looked over toward Squirrel Point before going up to the fire. Six mojo canoes five paddlers in each were just going in to the shore.    Indians, of course,  1 said, when I saw what he was looking at.   A brigade,  said Hendricks.  They ll sacrifice to Kokomis to-night, when the moon is an hour high.    He turned and went up to the fire-place.   The moon, just past the full, rose as we were finishing supper, and perhaps three- quarters of an hour later we started for Kokomis, intending to lie in the shadow of the shore and watch the chief of the brigade 1  5 116 A Daughter of Shining Woods put his offerings in tlie hollow at the base of the stone. I happened to be first in the little bay, and held on to a branch within a few feet of Kokomis. Hendricks slid alongside, and Helen. Mackvicar rested her hand on the gunwale of my canoe, just where a moonbeam came through the leaves and touched it. I thought she was trembling a little, though it may have been only the breeze in the alder leaves that made it seem so. The other four canoes lay out beyond all very quiet. We didn t have to wait long; the sc rape of the stem paddle against the rail of the rrtojo and the drip of water from the blades came to us from around the point almost, before the last of our party had come into the cove, and pres- ently the big birch shot into the shadow of Kokomis. Helen Mackvicar s hand was surely trembling now; I could feci it shake my canoe as it rested on the rail. The In- dian In. the bow of the birch laid aside his padd e and bent over the hollow at the feet of Kokomis, the other four kneeling motion- less against the thwarts. The bow man stood up; it was so dark in the shadow that we felt rather than saw him rise to his feet, and lift his hands over his head in the Indian attitude of prayer. He stood there for a moment, and then intoned the invo- cation :   Oh, Kokomis  give us good hunting   "The other four repeated after him:   Oh, Kokomis  give us good hunting    At the response i heard a long  A-ah  from Helen Mackvicar; the kind of sound y ou make when y on he ar some thin g yo u h a v e been trying to remember for a iong time. She took away her hand from the rail of my canoe as the mojo left the shore; Hendricks dipped his paddle like a man in a dream. I heard him mutter Good God    as he passed me. Not an exclamation of surprise ex- actly; of wonder, ratheT, and bewilderment.. " Do you know the Northern Lights  If you do, you know what the Bible means when it says,   The heavens declare the glory of God  It seems as if you must hear the sweep and rustle of them; somehow they make you afraid. We went back under the splendor of them that night, my canoe close to Hendricks s, all the way, though I might as well have been in the middle of the At- lantic for all lie or Helen Mackvicar knew of my presence. Once, I heard her repeat in a sort of whisper,iOh, Kokomis  give us good hunting    and her hands rose over her head as she said it. And above them those glorious flames, like the fires of bumt-offer- ing. I can see it all now; the air was clec- tric with what was between those two. Not what was between them, exactly, for there was nothing of that sort for some days, but with the sense of something that they alone knew about. As soon as we reached the island she went to her tent without a good-night to any of us.  'Bring your blankets out on the point,  said Hendricks to me. We often slept out there. The moss was a foot thick.   Do you know,1 he said, when we had rolled in,  she said the first words of that prayer when we stopped at the island on the way to the cove. It seemed as if she had known the rest, and forgotten it. Yet she doesn t know a word of Ojihway and never heard of Kokomis.  I answered something or other I for- get what but he paid no attention to it. He lay there with his eyes wide open, the moon shining on his facc. I fell asleep pres- ently, but woke, as you do in the woods, shortly after midnight. The birds are all awake then, and the squirrels; everything seems to be moving. Hendricks was lying as he had been hours before.   Her great-grandfather was a mission- ary in this region,  3 heard him say to him- self, and I knew he was still looking for a solution of the riddle.  A white-throated sparrow the Indians call it  W'asaks Manitou,  which means 1 The Spirit of Shining Woods, woke us next morning by singing on a bush over our heads and flew away as I moved. Hendricks was lying as I had seen him when the birds had twittered sleepily at midnight; I do not think he had moved or slept all night long.   He and I and four others were starting that morning after moose, a two-weeks  trip or more, over to Quebec side. The party tumed out early to wish us good luck, but the girl wasn t among them. Hendricks moxred away slowly that morning and our canoe was launched last of all. She came down just as we shoved clear of tlie shore.   Good hunting  she said, .speaking so low that the words hardly reached me where I sat in the bow. I felt Hendricks stop paddling; when I turned around he was looking steadily at her and she was returning his gaze, biting her lip a little.

The moon was half an hour high when I woke up. From the edge ol the woods a white-throated sparrow sang once, not chirped, you understand, as they always do soon after midnight, but sang his whole song. It goes Stirling whistled the note and paused. His pipe had gone out; he was sitting on the edge of his chair, his elbows resting on the arms and his hands rlasped tight to- gether. " It gave one the creeps, coming that way in the middle of the night, I threw back my blankets, meaning to rouse the Test and start hunting again, but before I could do so they all woke up at once, just as if some one had called them, ' What is it   Dicky Livermore asked. It sounded as if he were answering a summons.    Wasaks Manitou sang again. A twig cracked, and a load of dew, brushed from a branch as if some one had passed, pattered down.  ' Hendricks    called Livermore.   Is that you, Hendricks   Something moved clear of the leafage. The fiie rustled and flared up.   'A woman,  cried Livermore.   Mitchi Wasaks   Tt was Couchineu who said that, as his hands rose straight above his head.  "It is I, MLlchi Wasaks  responded the figure. The voice was thin and far away, but there was something familiar about it for all that. I kicked up the fire. The long black hair fell free from the top of her bead, and was confined by a thong or its like at the nape of the neck, where a feather was stuck through it.  'Miss Mack vicar   I exclaimed.   How did you get here         Yes, of course,  she answered, but the voice was still strange. 11 knew that he was lost and I came.    Over her head the white-throat sang again J t .0.  r  V s   a L Come   she said.  I don t know why I obeyed, but I couldn t help myself. Couchineu and the rest followed along behind. She went up the watercourse and we thought we had searched in that direction thoroughly  farther than we h;ul gone, and turned in- to the woods. There wasn't a mark or sign to guide her, but she didn't hesitate a moment. We stumbled after her; she seemed to drift along without effort, turn- ing now" to the right, now to the left. I bent over to break a twig to guide us on our way back; the one 1 touched was already broken and beyond it were a number of others hanging down. I pointed this out to Cochineu.  'It is.the trail,  he said.  We had been going on for two hours now, but Helen Mackvicar, or whatever spirit had taken her form, never faltered. The sky was gray with daylight, and all the birds were stirring, but still we heard the white-throat above them all. There seemed to be but one, which was strange. As we entered a burned area where the huckle- berries grew thick, the sun rose above the horizon. Hucklcberry bush conceals all marks except blood stains, but she pushed steadily through it; often it waved as high as her waist. A track appeared in the mud at our feet, made apparently by some heavy body moving painfully. Tt may have been imagination, but I thought the bird had been fluttering ahead of her for a long lime, and I know that a bird lit on the branch of a dead pine fifty feet or so ahead and sang there. Just then I saw a hand print in the mud, and beyond it another. X jumped forward through the bush, but she was ahead of me.   Under the pine where the white-throat was singing we found Hendricks with his leg broken. He opened his eyes and saw the girl.   Mitchi Wasaks,1 he whispered.   I have found you  she said. She put I hr I   ; i nl ii    ic   her hand l   her forehead, looked wildly about her fur :i moment then.   iiiie slowly, she sank down in a dead faint, and  he part of her that had been strange left her as nnst.s leave a lake in llie nmming.

Readers whose time is of some value lo them would find ii hard to explain upon what principle of selection they proceed in making their ten- tative sips or gulps from the tide, and endeav- oring lo determine, from their own casual gustations  excuse me, 1 have been reading Sam Johnson ,  what main currents draw the years.  Hut if one rare swimmer and swallower in the current stream of fiction may trust his own observation, it is symptomatic that the super- natural, barred from fiction for several genera- tions, is re-entering,  with power 1 Two of the recent novelists whom a reader with something else to do has found himself somehow forced to read are Du Maurier and De Morgan. Modernizing Thackeray as they both do, though you might maintain that the newer also addicts bimseli to modernizing Pickens, they both rush in where their masters would have feared lo tread. Dickens, indeed, was by no meansabove telling ghost stories. But. like Mr. Kipling in  A Matter of Fact.  he  told it .isa lie," when he rliu not present it as an equally obvious allegory, and never lora moment endeavored to impose upon the credulity of his readers.

The double consciousness in   Hard C ash,   and again in  A Simpleton," is not supernatural, Vol.. XLVH   rs Inn pseudo-scientific. The mid-Victorians, in fact, disdained or ignored as subject-matter any material which was not documented. But llie lale Victorians and earlv Kdwardians have reverted to the prime matter of romance. 1 he two recent novelists wc have named might be dismissed as amateurs who have felt bound to imparl an adventitious interest to their pictures ol life and manners There is nothing of the supernatural in  ' Joseph Vance.  But the ghost in  Alice for Short'' is, so to sty, of the essence, and it is pretty nearly as documented as the double consciousness in  Somehow Good.  But Du Maurier sought and found a properly supernatural motive for each of his stories. The  dreaming true  in   I eter Ibbetson," the hypnotism in  Trilby,  are distinctly of the essence. And so was the Martian motive in  The Martian,  in the au- thor s mind, inappreciable as that motive  may lie lo the readers who have yd found delight in the picture of the Krench School life of ;i British or  bilingual  boy But the supernatural element is by no means to be dismissed as llie last refuge of the ama- teur. Mr. Henry James does not make upon anybody the impression of the amateur. And yet he has repeatedly founded tales upon the hypothesis that then- were more things in heaven and earth than were dreamt of in even his psychology. It is true that only one of these tales can be called successful. The  Turn of the Screw  alone of th.-m is  convincing," even lo the reader most willing lo be convinced -at least to submit himsell lor the time of read- ing lo the illusion the writer aims to produce.  The Private Life" makes, in fact, only tho impression of a rather lumbering and a double- headed social or even political satire, and  Thc- Sacred 1'ount" is in danger of making upon the most willing reader no impression at all. The Point of View I vi-n Mr. Howells, iluil   1 mjilitie.st champion "I " realism,  who would ostensibly scorn must the :n Ivt-ni il ii  us interest nf incidents at nil out uf I In- common, has derogated somewhat from   i i -i   nit it i   ilcs in this pa nil ular, as in   The I. mlisoiveri i  Country.

Wl. have heard much about the repeti lion in the individual of the life of the race, and doubtless tlu least observant among us have noted confirmatory tokens, as, for instance, the tendency "I the young human to walk 011 lour legs, and those stages of urchin life which suggest only too vividly the actions of primitive man. It is strange that no one has had much to say about the fact that we reach further back, beyond out human selves, beyond our vertebrate selves, even beyond the power of motion, to a primal fixedness. There are moments in my experi- ence, and they multiply as I grow older, when 1 am distinctly aware, through all the intricacies of being since that    Vegetable earlv dim existence, of my kinship with the first lichen clinging to the first ruck. Greater than I have talked of reminiscent intimations of immortality; to me come inti- mations of petal, stem and root There arc- certain moods for which our kinship with the animal world cannot account, leaf and bark moods, a feeling of identity with waving grass and with wind-tossed branches.

The raggetl tresis of the militant hemlocks in die West Woods, telling of centuries of struggle with wind and sleet, and the worn and twisted cellars 1 bilging lo rocks along the coast, wear the look that vou now and then see upon an aged,  unsurrendered face,  recording an expression that has not been all defeat. Perhaps die most obvious manilestaiion of our kinship w ith the world of llxed and rooted lile Comes in our devotion to things There The Point of View 123 is a terrible story by Balzac,  Le Cure de Tours,  written with that masterly realism whereby his records of human experience are bitten into our minds as with acid following the graving of an etcher s tool, the story of the Abbe Birotteau, who loved with consum- ing passion another s household possessions, and inherited them, only to lose them through trickery, losing with them health and all the joy of life. I doubt if any other writer has ever portrayed so vividly that fatal human dinging to objects which I believe is a sur- vival from our vegetable state. Balzac asserts that celibates old maids, bachelors, priests  arc most subject to this low form of human experience. So menacing is his power of pre- senting his ideas that I always believe him, whether I will or no, and I plead guilty, not only of belonging to one of the despised classes, which I will not say, but of possessing an in- ordinate love of objects, of which he speaks so scornfully, not of jewels, or of garments, but of certain placcs and ccrtain things which have grown all but human from their long association with human life. As I say this, I recall, from earlier days, that southern doorway of my grandfather s old house, with the broad stone steps, and the gravelled path by which the single red roses bloomed in June, and I remember the clock with the green weeping willow picture upon its face, and the straight-backed, rush-seated chairs. The aged folk whose white heads I see against this background had grown one with their great maples for nearly ninety years, and I cannot separate them in my thought from tlie flowers that blossomed about their door. As these pictures come back in memory I realize that I, too, am growing fast daily to the spot in which I live, becoming part of my bit of earth. With our apple trees I have put down root for root, which will not comc up without a wrench; the fibres of my being which have twisted about the mahogany settle and highboy will tear them and me if broken apart. I am anything but a cling- ing vine; my sex and my profession forbid that, and yet, to the old-fashioned serving table, the windows toward the west, even to certain copper pots and pans, cling ten- drils that put to shame woodbine fingers with their violent hold. The fine and fibrous roots that spread; the great lonely roots that take earth into a deadly grip, and the hard, curling tcntacles which grasp lintel and eaves so fatally that withdrawing them means death  I know them all. There arc aspects of this phase of human life which are pleasant; there arc others which might well fill one with apprehension. The tendency to hold fast being inevitable, how shall one abide the fear of going away  I have been meaning to ask some learned bot- anist or florist if many plants share with certain fems the tendency to wither and die if the pot containing them is but carried from one room to another. I, growing downward with un- numbered fibres of New England grass, shiver lest some rude wind of destiny may tear me up. With terror 1 bear the fiat that I must rend all ties and spend next year in Greece. If this come to pass, shall I be better than an uprooted vegetable  Can I send down roots among those cold, perfect stones  Even now, for brief spaces, in strange spots, I have a sense of withering, a baseless feeling, as of a plant cut sharply off. What if homesickness is, after all, but reminiscence, a dim, uncon- scious memory of roots  Reflection opens up many a subject of in- quiry, on which Sir Thomas Browne, might well have speculated. Are not our throes to discover a fixed and irrevocable theology or philosophy a harking back to that immobile time, an attempt to shirk the consequences of having come to life, a desire lo return to a state of being from which relentless nature, now that we have once departed, relentlessly banishes us   IIow many of us may be seen in the lichen state, cowering full length upon a stone; how many in the sea-anemone stage, feebly moving tentacles in endless circles, for- getting that our spiritual life is that of the quest, and that the great gift of motion was granted us that wc might move it may be, for, spite of unceasing efforts, the old hope has not been disproved toward some great end. It is a curious question, too, why reminiscent hints of primitive animal life should come so early in the life of the individual, the tendency to return to vegetable ways so late. Indubit- ably it is to the aged and the ageing that it comes, and none could claim that it repre- sents the height of our achievement, being rather but a quiet descent. It is a kindly ex- prience, not like those violent emotions which rend and tear us in the heyday of our lives; gently accustoming us to the ways of earth, preparing us for the time when we shall feel, if not the daisies, at least the grass growing over us.

The full value of that memorable day could not, it seems to llie, be fully applet iated unless one had seen the single machine of W ilbur Wright, tin pioneer bird, living over the Camp of Avour at Le Mans a year ago. The most sanguine enthusiast did not even dream then of the thing that the plains of Bethein licit I in store for him. since human invention had not vet learned the pace that aviation was to en- gender in it.

His parciita were leading figures in the aboli- tion ist nvivemcn I, and I nun I In time o  his n im- nig into the world in i.S 17. to the completion of his studies at Harvard, twenty years later, he must have lived in an atmosphere of peculiar seriousness. Then he went to Paris and en- tered the Ecole des Beaux Ails. L liiinately he was to diverge fr  111 the teat lungs "t that in- stitution, but il is important to remember how much he profited bv them in bis young man- hood. The great French school means disci pline, and the idea of discipline, as we shall presently see, was heavily to count throughout his development. It was deeply indispensable to him when lie returned lo  mcrita. American architecture was in a state oi t ran - sition. The nineteenth century hail given spur adic signs, for a few decades, oi some fidelity to the refined laste of tile eighteenth, but l i   Civil War destroyed the last siirvivinv stand aids, and the art of the builder needed to be rehabilitated Irom top to bottom. It must ha c seemed a hopeless undertaking. I glint ami. what was worse, ignorance, had evideuib en- trenched themselves in Secure possession. In the 1 ampaign opened against these twin tyrants, everythin" depended upon the leaders. I wo men of genius, the seniors of McKim by a score of years, were already enlisted win 11 lie caille bat k   111111 lii.s Parisian schooling and l u- i' pean Iravt Is.   ine of them, the late Kit hard Morris Hunt, was him elf a product of the same training. I Iis gilts had not only been strengthened, but dt cisivt lv moulded bv the I ra- dii ii ins of the Lcole ties Beaux Arts. A man of rich and even robust temperament, he was, nevertheless, all his life long, faithful to a cer- tain academic point of view. He could be very light in ha ml, verv gracclul, when he chose, as witness the house, modelled 011 a 1 Ii Ueau of the French Renaissance, which he built for Mr.  V K Vanderbilt. at Fifth Avenue and Fifty tirst Street Hut the 11 uesi measure of his power is given in sut li an etlilit t- as that which he de- signed for the Lenox Library, a work ofweighty scholarship, composed with a sort of imper- 'i m a I sense til archil 11 I ural law. II is style, at I - mirable as it is for its force ami integrity, and fruitful as il has been in the grow 1 li 1 if  11111 it an architecture, must have seemed to McKim wanting in tlexibiliiv ami charm. How was he affected by that of the late Henry Hobson Kit hanlsoii, under win mi lie had li is first prac- tical experiences as an architect   Richardson, like Hunt, had gone to Europe for his iuspiiatioii, but where Ins colleague's temperament had adjusted itself to a syste- matic conception of design, he had drunk al- mtist 10 tin pt lint of int' '.xication of the gcnenhis and even heady wine of Romanesque arclii lecture.   kintlling emotion was expressed in his w   ri., which embrated a number of small houses, but was most conspicuous in larger fields. I le designed many monumental struct- ures. impressive in mass anti verv warm, though ueve 1 exaggerated, in their decorative aspects. Flic lower of Trinity Church in Boston is, perhaps, the most characteristic thing he ever did Ii is a line composition. and there are other works of Richardson which the his torian of our architecture must value, but his influence was to prove curiously short lived. Partly, I iltinl., it was because his art, in sharp contrast to Hunt's, was too intensely personal I le was paid die doubtlul compliment of eager 126 The Field of Art imitation, but he left no school. Moreover, and this is possibly the truer explanation of his failure to establish a tradition, there was no place for the Romanesque idea in the forma- tion of American taste. Hunt, after all, in his academic way, was: nearer to the authentic spring ir this matter, and McKim was at its very brink, When he left Richardson he was in the mood to beat out for himself a style which can only be described as ecLectic, with the qualification that whatever was to deter- mine its final color, it would not be either the Ecole des Beaux Arts or the Romanesque Cathedrals. It was in the later seventies that he and Wil- liam Rutherford Mead and the late Stanford White settled down to work in harness. They were foreordained to tie associated together, each contributing something that the others lacked, while all three moved naturally to a common end. The new firm played its part with a free hand, delightfully disregarding all ideals save the one which, owing to their varied resources, they were able to invent for them- selves, The houses dating from their earlier period and it was upon domestic architecture that they were then chiefly engaged made a wonderfully fresh and original eft'ect in the dreary ensemble of the streets of New York, and they were no less piquant to meet when isolated in the country. One of their notable city buildings was the dwelling crcctcd on the west side of Fifth Avenue-, just above Thirty, fifth Street, for Mr. J. Coleman Drayton, later occupied by the Engineers  Club, and very re- cently demolished under the pressure of that business movement which has been trans- forming the once fashionable thoroughfare. It ought to have been preserved as a landmark in our artistic history. It was a conclusive challenge to the supremacy of the stereotyped "brown stone front.  Everything about it was new and charming, beginning with the broad and easy  'front stoop,which was really not a front stoop at all, but a beautiful staircase. The first stage of the facade was built of rough-faced courses of stone, relieved by delicate carvings around a simple arched entrance. Above, the lines of wall and windows the latter including a singularly unobtrusive bay were treated with the most fastidious restraint. The house had a physiognomy, one so original as imme- diately to arrest attention, and, at the same time, so refined, so quietly touched with ele- gance, that the last thing in the world it sug- gested was the opening of an artistic revolution. Something of  lie same distinction attaches to the house further up the avenue, which was built for Mr. R. Fulton Cutting, and which still exists. Oilier examples might be cited. But belter than a catalogue which, for one thing, would he too voluminous is a word on the broad significance of the en trance of McKim and his partners into American architecture. It was not so very long ago, a   years are counted, but the moment now seems historical. The artist in building was coming into his own. It was good to be alive and in the midst of tre- mendous changes, which seemed none the lcs3 tremendous because the public at large was hardly aware of what was going on. Archi- tecture was more important than any other human interest, and it was templing to believe that its fortunes in this country were largely in the hands of one group of men. Everybody knew and honored the two pioneers I have named, and everybody knew that several other brilliant men were at work. There was, for instance, a prodigious stir when Babb, Cook, and Willard built a warehouse in Duane Street, placing a new and beautiful stamp upon com- mercial architecture. But McKim, Mead,and White dominated the rising tide. Young men of talent, many ol whom now occupy command- ing positions in their profession, came trooping into the firm s office, which was an office in name, but had the character of an atelier. The first of our modern sky-scrapers, a modest enough affair, had just gone up on lower Broad- way, but problems of steel construction gave comparatively little concern to McKim and his followers. If they had dealings with engineers, their associations were more intimate with painters and sculptors, and the men in the al- lied professions who were part of their circle, were men like La Farge and Sairt-Gaudcns. The artistic temperament, pure and simple, had everything Ur own way. The important thing was just to make a building beautiful. Jt was inspiring to observe the manner in which McKim showed how this was to be done. The task of exhibiting the play of his influence is a little difficult, but it is full of interest. In a work of collaboration, two or more men may so skilfully fuse their identities as to puzzle even themselves, to say nothing of the public; but sooner or later the world comes to know just what each brought to the study of a given problem. Character will out. You cannot hide individual genius behind a firm name. In discussion of the buildings designed by McKim, Mead, and White, it has been customary to I Iil- PicM iif Art recognize the exceptional unilvof that partner- ship, and lo leave unanswered tlie question as In which one of the three mav have determined this or that element in the .style practiced l y them all. Reserve in the matter has hern very natural. An analysis of their work which seeks t i carry the inquiry thus far soon threatens in entangle the critic ill a classification nf specific buildings, ami that is not onlv intrusive hut full of peril. For example, the factillv nf Stan ford    liite was romantic, and evi 11 plavful, hut I recall a talk with him about tin- line cornice  il the Tiffany Building, in which the puint nf view he disclosed was that of an architect en- gaged upon a positively austere conception. It is idle, then, tn parcel out the achievements nf the firm. On the ntlier hand, it would he equally foolish, in speak ing ol Mi K mi, t   evade the detachment of his personality frnm the working scheme to which lie contributed sn much. To any one familiar with the subject he must remain as clearly defined a figure in our architecture as any of the leaders in our sculpture or painting. An artist in the strictest sense nf the term, and, as has been shown by reference t" the Drayton house, an artist nf fresh and original trails, he was, nevertheless, a type nf intellect driving at beauty, and deep reflection went to the making ol his work. Ib  principles were thought mil, tint emotionally improvised. They started with the organic character of a building whose functions were to find not only charming but right expression. Thus he never did anything merely for effect; his facades might be never so original, but you would recog- nize always their absolute fitness. IIU build- ings unmistakably belonged to their sites I his fact has been obscured for Some of his commentators by the not infrequent modelling of one of his buildings upon some historic Furopean monument. Argument has gone ofl at a tangent, confusing the question of policy involved with the question of the artist's pure constructive purpose. Ignore fnr a moment this matter of the adaptation   f foreign designs, and look simply tn an inquiry as lo whether McKim did not work out his problems from the centre, giving his buildings an ineffaceable stamp eloquent of their purpose. In illustra- tion of his constructive feeling I have only to mention, in addition to the domestic types of design already cited, the churches in the Fnglish manner built at Lenox, Stockbridge, and Morristown; the collegiate buildings at Har- vard, Columbia, and elsewhere; the library for Mr. M"ig an; iln     mill r r  j.i  buildings for 1 iltany and   loi ham; tin.

It is far more to the point to consider Lliis work as a whole, to note Mi Kim's exploitation of broad ideas as wi II as his oci asiniial reprodiH lion of par  tit ular models, and then to remark the vital fashion in which he handles practical issues. IIis genius works in the stuff of American life, he takes our social and civic needs into his mine 1 and proceeds to satisfy them, not as a dilettante erecting handsome- sc reens upon the highway, but as a creative builder. The designing of such structure-, as I have sum marized has been established upon a higher plane through' mt the country through his influ- ence. When he built a library or a church, a c lub-hoiise or a state capitnl, he left it a build- ing v. itli a soul Incidentally, he Iramcl lor us a in archi- tectural language. Some- critics of that lan- guage have been much perturbed    ver its irigin. inclining t" the belief that he took it bodily from abroad. I used to wonder what thev were thinking abc ut when tin- gri  upoi houses km iwn as the Villard Block was erect'd in Madison Avenue, back of the Cathedral, and the bank at F ilth Avenue and Foi'tv-sccond Street had been built The influence of ihe Roman palace in Bramante's era was to lie felt in llie first of tin se performances, and the Florentine Renaissance was ch arly to be discerned in the "the r; but it was ihe spirit, 11  't the letter, ol the old law that had controlled in both instances, and lliis it was that he developed in himself, and poured into t ie work of his firm, lie developed it slowly, and very thoughtfully. He did not learn the value i if the Italian Renaissance as c me lean: - a less' hi, but gradually absorbed it a-, lie absorbed classical ideas and some French influences Little bv little he came in do lu  wnrk in a kind of dry light, steadilv getting rid ni all that was superfluous in detail, steadily expressing him- self in larger and simpler terms. Ile used the style of the Renaissance' just as the late J F Bentlv used that of Byzantium, when he de- signed perhaps the most remarkable piece of pure architecture in our epoch, the supe rb Ro- man Catholic Cathedral in Loudon. lie used it, that is to sav. as an instrument whie h lie had 12S The Field of Art made entirely his own. 1 have spoken of his  young men,  and of the reaction of his work upon the work of many of his contemporaries, i le was effective in this way because he handed on no academic formula, but a habit of mind making for refinement and balance. The Renaissance supplied him with a vehicle not only in harmony with his own nature, but wonderfully favorable to his purpose in view of the existing conditions in American taste. We have been putting our house in order, we have had to make fresh starts, to try numerous ex- periments, and, in short, to organize our artistic energies. Above all, we have wanted curbing. If the laying of an iron rod upon our warring impulses was to be made endurable, the meas- ure of discipline imposed by the Renaissance was imcomparably the best for us to adopt. Pure line, deftly balanced mass, graceful and not too lavish decoration, with a perfectly ra- tionalized aim underlying them all, would win us from the nondescript and the uncouth, from meaningless form and redundant color. We would yield the more readily, too, as this reign of law was humanized, made not only dignified and authoritative but beguiling. McKim, who waxed in severity as he progressed, never ceased to charm, and hence his rule was easily consoli- dated. He had a genius for this kind of rule, because he had a genius for beauty. That was what his disciples felt, and it was through that that he helped them. It was once my privilege to go with him through the sculpture galleries of the Vatican, making notes of the statues that seemed suitable for a decorative plan then in the air. There had been talk of reproducing a quantity of classical sculpture in plaster casts, to be distributed throughout the grounds of the World s Fair at Chicago, and we prepared to- gether a long list. The experience was pre- cious. McKim saw these sculptured episodes, as they were intended to be, in all their relations If he accepted or rejected a suggestion, his com- ments bore partly upon the intrinsic qualities of a statue, but more upon its probable effect against the background at Chicago. He would pause before some piece, and in a few words explain its fitness or its uselessness. I vividly remember how the man at whose feet I sat en- larged my horizon, and pul the whole question of sculptural decoration in a new perspective. His taste was inexorable. He had a passion to be right. It would have landed a lesser man in pedantry. To him the rule of thumb was abhorrent. He prized what was good in the Ecole des Beaux Arts, but he was impatient when its graduates tried to acclimatize here just so many French patterns. When he founded the American Academy at Rome it was not to substitute an Italian for a French form- ula, but to lead the young student, almost in- sensibly, into a nobler, more disciplined, and yet freer way of thinking and working. Thus he himself thought and worked, a steadying force in American art. Royal Corxissoz.

It is the PIANOLA PIANO that has wrought this change. Everyone can play the PIANOLA Piano artistically, humanly from the moment it comes into the home. Naturally, therefore, people prefer it to the old style of piano, that took so long to learn to play. For a time the PIANOLA Piano was the only instrument of its kind upon the market. It was far too successful, however, to escape imitation. Today practically the entire piano manufacturing business of the world has been changed to follow the lead of the PIANOLA Piano. Now, as in earlier days, the PIANOLA Piano stands alone as a distinct type of musical instrument. Such vital features as the Metrostyle, the Themodist, etc., which a re exclusive wi t h t he PI AN O LA Piano, give that instrument an artistic standing not shared even in slight degree by any other instrument of its kind.

ADl'liRIISER Important to Users of and There are two points of view toward furniture. Some persons consider a chair something to sit on, a table something to eat from, a bed something to sleep in and there they stop. A constantly increasing number of persons realize that furniture may be not only useful, which it should be first of all, but that it may have esthetic, intellectual and even ethical bear- ing upon the lives of those who use it. Esthetic, intellectual and ethical values cannot he measured and sold by the yard, pound or piecc, but the thinking world has come to believe that beauty and worth, even in inanimate things like furniture, have an influence worth considering. Wc have been pioneers in America in this philosophy of the beautiful and the good as it relates to furniture, and we have lived to see a wide public not only accept but demand these qualities in their surroundings. Our problem, in recent years, has been to make enough furniture of the Cowan standard to keep pace with the demand created by the furniture itself 1 hat problem has been solved by the erection of our new Model Workshops, the largest of their kind in the world, covering an entire city block on the Lake Shore Drive in Chicago.

To that end we are now perfecting a branch sales organization, through exclusive selling agencies in cities and towns throughout the country. There is a percentage of buyers in every community who appre- ciate furniture of Cowan quality and character. We invite correspon- dence from them and from dealers who arc equipped to do justice to such buyers and to such furniture in their respective communities.

The other, and equally im- portant, half consists in getting back the answer. Sometimes this is a reply to a question, or the acceptance or rejection of a pro- posal. Sometimes it is simply an acknowl- edgment that the message has been received. The value of the message depends upon getting an answer. When a general manager sends word to a representative in a distant city, he wants to know that his man is there, that he receives the message, and that he will act If the answer is not final, but raises another question, there is no delay. The other question can be settled at once. It is possible, in one telephone interview, to come to a decision which could not have been reached without the instan- taneous answer. Each answer is made instantaneous by the Bell telephone service. The Bell system, with its ten million miles of wire, provides the instantaneous answer for anybody, anywhere, at any time. Increased use of the Long Distance Telephone means greater results in every line of human endeavor. Telephone efficiency means One Policy, One System, Universal Ser- vice.

On my last expedition I had a Model 1892 .44 calibcr Carbine and Winchester cartridges, which I carried with me right to the North Pole. After I left the ship I de- pended upon it to bring down the fresh meat that we needed. Since 1888, both in Nicaragua and in the Arctic regions, I have always used the Winchester Repeaters. Each of my Arctic expeditions, since '91, has been fitted with these arms. The last expedition carried the .44-4C Carbine, for use on deer, seals, hare and the like, ant the .40-82 for use on musk-oxen, walrus and polar   bears.

Equipped with a motor so flexible as to take smoothly the short, sharp corners and curves of city streets, yet powerful enough for any road con- ditions encountered in town or country. So constructed as to permit of easily turning in narrow streets. The ideal car for all the social exigencies of daily life   the theatre, shopping, calling or evening functions   and for all kinds of weather. Easy of access, with wide, roomy seats. Limousines and landaulets fitted with electric light, clock, note pad, cigar lighter, speaking tube and every convenience; richly finished in broadcloth or whipcord. The Sturdiest Car No one knows how long a Stearns will last, for no Stearns has ever worn out. Steams cars have been made continually for the past 13 years, and as far as we know every Stearns ever built is in active use today. Each car, before it is sent from the factory, is given a rigorous test for endurance. It is tested out in the country, where every resistance that any car will ever encounter is met. Stearns cars have more reserve power than any car of like rating of any make the re- serve force in a Stearns engine is what has made Stearns power famous. We spend extravagantly in the making, where the expenditure adds to the strength. That's why the Stearns costs more than common cars. But that s why the Stearns endures. The Ultimate Car No car is more luxurious or aristocratic. It is mechanically perfect and the sturdiest car made. Because of this and its wonderful reserve power the Stearns is the ultimate car. Most Stearns owners have owned other makes. It has seemed natural for them to progress gradually through varying gradesof quality until they reached the Stearns   the ultimate of excellence. But once Stearns owners, they have settled down into a contented pride of ownership,for the St earns is the ultimate car the car to keep. The car shown above is the famous 15-30 H. P. Stearns Limousine Town and Country Car. It can also be had in landaulet, touring car or toy tonncau body. A more powerful car than the one illustra- ted, of equal quality and luxury, will be found in the 30 60 II.P. chassis with limousine body. Licensed under the Selden patent. THE F. B.

SreS ATWOOD GRAPE FRUIT No new principle is involved in this fruit cure. It 1ms been demonstrated by physicians and sufferers from rheumatism that the citric ucid ot this delicious Tlorida product accomplishes in the most delightful and natural way what the bottle method too often fails in doing. Says the Bureau of Chemistry of the Department of Agriculture, in speaking of citric acid:  ft combines with certain bases and the resulting combinations in turn am transformed into carbonates, thus rendering an unduly acid urine alkaline.'  Thus nature has responded to the world-wide cry for relief from a distressing malady by appealing to the palate in a most seductive way.

CHARLES SCRIBNLRS SONS, NIIW YORK In the past 11 years the capital of the IRVING NATIONAL EXCHANGE BANK has been increased from $300,000 to 52,000.000; the deposits have grown from SI.200.000 to more than $25,000,000; and the assets from less than $2,000,000 to $29,000,000. The cause chiefly contributing to this growth is prompt, exact, interested and accommodating service. Banking service is of two kinds: one is the service of inflexible rule and lixed routine; the other kind of service is flexible enough to be adapted to individual requirements and business exigencies. The service rendered by the living National Exchange Bank is not formal and impersonal, but friendl  and interested. It is realized that to promote the best interests of the customer is to promote the best interests of the Bank.

Security and Liberal Income Guaranteed Customary Security. Are Additionally Guaranteed. No delay in payment of Principal or Interest. Each Water Works or Irrigation Bond vve offer is secured by a mortgage on a particular plant or enterprise, the real value of the property being much greater than its bonded indebtedness. Such a mortgage is the only security usually offered on bonds of this class issued by a reputable com- pany, and is generally considered sufficient. In addition to such mortgages, however, the bonds we offer bear the absolute guarantee of the American Water Works   G uarantee Co., of Pittsburgh, Pa., capital and surplus, $4,500,000, as to prompt payment of both principal and interest. These bonds are doubly securcd. This company controls and operates forty successful water works plants and four prosperous irrigation enterprises in different parts of the United States. It guarantees only the securities of properties it investigates and constructs with its own engineers, and controls and operates with its own organization. During its twenty-seven years of business there has never been a single day's delay in the payment of either principal or interest on any bond it has guaranteed. With each new issue the additional assets acquired by this con- structing, operating, and guaranteeing company are always greater than the contingent liability assumed. The strength of its guarantee continually increases as its business extends. We Are Selling the Securities of the Two Largest Irrigation Enterprises, Public or Private, in the United States J. S.

L 105 An Exceptional Issue of 6% Bonds Secured by a Thousand Farms Here are brief facts about one current issue of Irrigation Bonds. They will illustrate what ideal security lies back of such bonds when the issues are rightly selected. The Bitter Root Valley Irrigation Co. owns one of the largest Irrigated fruit land projects in the world. The Company is composed of well-known men who are wealthy, experienced and capable. The land to be watered consists of about 40,000 acres in the heart of our greatest fruit belt in the famous apple region of the Pacific Northwest. A large part of the valley has been under irriga- tion for many years, so the possibilities of the land have been demonstrated. Fruit land in the valley has lately sold as high as Si,000 per acre. The water rights are unassailable, and the total water supply is more than sufficient for all needs. For the irrigable land is distinctly limited by the mountainous bounds of the valley. $2,500,000 Invested The Irrigation Company has invested in the project about  2,500,000, or about twice the total bond issue. And the bonds are secured by a first mortgage on all the property which the Irrigation Company owns. The bonds are additionally secured by first liens on the lands and the orchards watered. These liens are given by individual land owners in payment for the land and the water rights. Forty per cent of the price is paid down, and the balance, secured by the liens, is payable in annual installments. To secure each Si ,000 bond there are deposited with a Trust Company as trustee Si,400 of these lirst liens on farm land. The average price at which this land has been sold is about $200 per acre. The minimum price at present is $250 per acre. Yet the bond issue is limited to $30 per acre, or to less than one-sixth the average selling price of the land. Double Security Thus the bonds have double security. The first is a mortgage 011 all the property which the Irriga- tion Company owns, and the Company s investment is nearly twice the whole bond issue. The second security is these first liens on farm land on land which is worth more than six times the amount of the bonds which it secures. One can hardlv conceive of more ample security. Yet these bonds pay six per cent interest, because llie demand for irrigated land is so great that the projects are very profitable. Part of these bonds mature each year from 1914 lo 10 9- One may have his choice of maturities. Ask for the Facts Tn the past years we have purchased 75 sepa rate issues of Reclamation Bonds Drainage and Irrigation. All have been secured by first liens on good farm land, and not a dollar of loss has re- sulted to any investor. Irrigation bonds have now become the most popular bonds that we handle. No other large class of bonds offering equal security now pays six per cent We have issued a book on Irrigation Bonds, based on all this experience. Every investor, small or large, owes to himself its lirst perusal. Please write for the book today. Cut out this coupon so you won t forget.

Each month, illustration , prac- tical floor plans, and descriptions of Craftsman houses are published, and to subscribers working drawings and such assistance as the Craftsman architects can give the builder are offered free.

ADVERTISER Hounded to Death by the Sugar Trust More Inside Commercial History The fart-lurid storv of one man's marvel- lously cunning intrigues with the American Sugar Refining Company official title of the Sugar Trust and how this same man hyp- notized the president of a ". cat and powerful financial institution, driving him ultimately to ruin and suicide 1 Eight of the  eminently respectable  mem- bers of the Trust were indicteil by the Gov- ernment and dragged down from their high pedestals of smug gentility. In the end the over-cunning individual was himself driven into bankruptcy. All this makes a prescnt-dav narrative beside which the deeds of Captain Kidd and his band of cut-throats becomes a mere nursery tale. For the first time in the long, black hist or v of the Sugar Trust the facts are now laid bare to the public eve, the whole mass of cor- ruption, fraud, intrigue and criminal proced- ure presented in plain, every-day language. These facts are as fascinating as fiction, shameful though they be, and horrifying to the clean manhood of the nation. Big figures move through the narrative  unsuspected personalities, smirched by the mud-spatter of this battle of Titan crook against Titan crook. Cringing in the shadow of an ex-Sccretary of War and Siale and a present Senator from New York the whole disreputable gang o  malefactors hides. Not a pretty picture this tableau of an em- inent statesman shielding and advising the most conscienceless group of commercial cut- purscs that ever infested the avenues of trade. This tale of business villainy is now told to the whole world, told with a backing of incontrovertible proof letters, contracts, records- and the crimes of a set of smooth and polished rascals given to all who read, and who revile dishonesty. Almost unbelievable are these simple facts, almost incredible the low methods and petty schemes of a giant corporation that dared everything and stopped at nothing. To-day the chief factors in the great Sugar Combine arc at the bar of justice; to-mor- row, those who have not resorted to self- destruction or taken to their heels will lie wearing prison snipes. You will find news of them every dnv, from now on. but the whole story, the complete record of their rascality, you can read only in the big story of  Tragedies of the Sugar rI rust,  bv Charles P.
