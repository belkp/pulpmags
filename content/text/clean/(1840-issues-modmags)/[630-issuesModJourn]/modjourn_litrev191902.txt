de Gourmont was less like the mind of Henry James than any contemporary mind I can think ofJamesdrawing of moeurs contemporaines was so circumstantialso concerned with the settingwith detailnuancesocial aromathat his transcripts wereout of datealmost before his books had gone into a second editionout of datethat isin the sense that his interpretations of society could never serve as a guide to such supposititious utilitarian members of the next generation as might so desire to use themHe has left his scene and his characters unalterable as the little paper flowers permanently visible inside the lumpy glass paperweightsHe was a great man of lettersa great artist in portrayalhe was concerned with mental temperaturescircumvolvulous social pressuresthe clash of contending conventionsas Hogarth with the cut of contemporary coatsOn no occasion would any man of my generation have broached an intimate idea to HJ or to Thomas HardyOM oryears sinceto Swinburneor even to MrYeats with any feeling that the said idea was likely to be receivedgraspedcomprehendedHowever much one may have admired Yeatspoetryhowever much one may have been admonished by Henry Jamesprose worksone has never thought of agreeing with eitherYou couldon the other handhave said to De Gourmont anything that came into your headyou could have sent him anything you had written with a reasonable assurance that he would have known what you were driving atIf this distinction is purely my ownand subjectiveand even if it be wholly untrueone will be very hard pressed to find any other man bornin thefiftiesof whom it is even suggestible2 The Little Review De Gourmont prepared our erabehind him there stretches a limitless darknessthere was the counter reformationstill extant in the English

the symbolistes Gourmont had his beginningIIIn contradiction toin wholly antipodal distinction from Henry JamesDe Gourmont was an artist of the nudeHe was an intelligence almost more than an artistwhen he portrayshe is concerned with hardly more than the permanent human elementsHis people are only by accident of any particular eraHe is poetmore by possessing a certain quality of mind than by virtue of having written fine poemsyou could scarcely contend that he was a novelistHe was intensely aware of the differences of emotional timbreand as a man s message is precisely his facon de voirhis modality of apperceptionthis particular awareness was hismessage Where James is concerned with the social tone of his subjectswith their entouragewith their superstes of dogmatizedform ethicetc De Gourmont is concerned with their modality and resonance in emotion Mauve FanetteNeobelleLa Vierge aux Platres are all studies in different permanent kinds of peoplethey are not the results of environments or ofsocial causes their circumstance is an accident and is on the whole scarcely alluded toGourmont differentiates his characters by the modes of their sensibilitynot by sub degrees of their state of civilizationThe Little Review 3 He recognizes the right of individuals to feel differentlyConfucianEpicureana considerer and entertainer of ideasthis complicated sensuous wisdom is almost the one ubiquitous elementtheselfwhich keeps his superficially heterogeneous work vaguelyunified The study of emotion does not follow a set chronological arcit extends from thePhysique de l AmourtoLe Latin Mystique from the condensation of Fabre s knowledge of insects toAmas ut facias pulchramin the Sequaire of GoddeschalkinLe Latin MystiqueHe had passed the point where people take abstract statement of dogma forenlightenment Anideahas little value apart from the modality of the mind which receives itIt is a railway from one state to anotherand as dull as steel rails in a desertThe emotions are equal before the aesthetic judgmentHe does not grant the duality of body and soulor at least suggests that this mediaeval duality is unsatisfactorythere is an interpenetrationan osmosis of body and soulat least for hypothesis My words are the unspoken words of my body And in all his exquisite treatment of all emotion he will satisfy many whom August Strindbergfor egregious examplewill notFrom the studies of insects to Christine evoked from the thoughts of Diomedesex is not a monstrosity or an exclusively German study And the entire race is not bound to the habits of the mantis or of other insects equally melodramaticSexin so far as it is not a purely physiological reproductive mechanism lies in the domain of aestheticsthe junction of tactile and magnetic sensesas some people have accurate ears both for rhythm and for pitchand as some are tone deafsome impervious to rhythmic subtlety and varietyso in this other field of the senses some desire the trivialsome the processionalthe statelythe master workAs some people are good judges of musicand insensible to painting and sculptureso the fineness of one sense entails no corresponding fineness in anotheror at least no corresponding critical perception of differences Foot note A German studyHobsona German study Tarr 4 The Little Review IIIEmotions to Henry James were more or less things that other people had and that one didn t go intoat any rate not in drawing roomsThe gods had not visited Jamesand the Muse whom he so frequently mentions appeared doubtless in corsagethe narrow waistthe sleeves puffed at the shouldersa la mode 1890 2De Gourmont is interested in hardly anything save emotionsand the ideas that will go into themor take life in emotional application Apperceptive rather than active One readsLES CHEVAUX DE DIOMEDE 1897as one would have listened to incense in the old Imperial courtThere are many spirits incapableDe Gourmont calls it aromance of possible adventures it might be called equally an aromathe fragrance of roses and poplarsthe savour of wisdomsnot part of the canon of literaturea book likeDaphnis and Chloeor like Marcel Schwob sLivre de Monelle not a solidarity like Flaubertbut an osmosisa pervasion My true life is in the unspoken Words of my body InUNE NUIT AU LUXEMBOURG the characters talk at more lengthand the movement is less convincing Diomedewas De Gourmont s own favourite and we may take it as the best of his artas the most complete expression of his particularfacon d apercevoir ifeven in itthe characters do little but talk philosophyor rather drift into philosophic expression out of a haze of imagesthey are for all that very realIt is the climax of his method of presenting characters differentiated by emotional timbrea process which had begun inHISTOIRES MAGIQUES 1895 and inD UN PAYS LOINTAIN published 1898in reprint from periodicals of 1892 4SONGE D UNE FEMME 1899is a novel of modern lifeDe Gourmont s sexual intelligenceas contrasted to Strindberg s sexual stupiditywell in evidenceThe work is untranslatable into Englishbut should be used before thirty by young men who have been during their undergraduate days too deeply inebriated with the Vita Nuova Tout ce qui se passe dans la viec est de la mauvaise litteratureLa vraie terre natale est celle ou on a eu sa premiere emotion forte The Little Review 5La virginite n est pas une vertuc est un etatc est une sous division des couleurs Livres de chevet for those whom the Strindbergian school will always leave aloof Les imbeciles ont choisi le beau comme les oiseaux choisissent ce qui est grasLa betise leur sert de cornesCOEUR VIRGINAL 1907is a light novelamusingand accurate in its psychologyI do not think it possible to overemphasize Gourmont s sense of beautyThe mist clings to the lacquerHis spirit was the spirit of Omakitsuhis pays natal was near to the peach blossom fountain of the untranslatable poemIf the life of Diomede is overdone and done badly in modern Paristhe wisdom of the book is not thereby invalidatedIt may be that Paris has need of some more Spartan correctivebut for the descendants of witch burners Diomede is a needful communicationIVAs Voltaire had been a needed light in the 18thcenturyso in our time Fabre and Fraser have been essentials in the mental furnishings of any contemporary mind qualified to write of ethics or philosophy or that mixed molasses religion The Golden Boughhas supplied the data which Voltaire s incisions had shown to be lackingIt has been a positive succeeding his negativeIt is not necessary perhaps to read Fabre and Fraser entirebut one must be aware of thempeople unaware of them invalidate all their own writing by simple ignoranceand their work goes ultimately to the scrap heap PHYSIQUE DE L AMOUR 1903should be used as a text book of biologyBetween this biological basis in instinctand theSequaire of GoddeschalkinLe Latin Mystique 1892stretch Gourmont s studies of amour and aestheticsIf in Diomede we find an Epicurean receptivitya certain aloofnessan Observation of contacts and auditionsin contrast to the Propertian attitudeIngenium nobis ipsa puella facitthis is perhaps balanced by 6 The Little ReviewSans vousje crois bien que je n aimerais plusbeaucoup et que je n aurais plus une extreme confiance ni dans la vie ni dans moimemeinLettres a l AmazoneBut there is nothing more unsatisfactory than saying that De Gourmonthad such and such ideasor heldsuch and such views the thing is that he held ideasintuitionsperceptions in a certain personal exquisite mannerIn a criticism of him criticismbeing an over violent wordinlet us sayan indication of himone wants merely to show that one has oneself made certain dissociationsas herebetween the aesthetic receptivity of tactile and magnetic valuesof the perception of beauty in these relationshipsand the conception of lovepassionemotion as an intellectual instigationsuch as Propertius claims itsuch as we find it declared in the King of Navarre sDe fine amor vient science et beaute and constantly in the troubadours I cannot repeat too often that there was a profound psychological knowledge in mediaeval Provencehowever gothic its expressionthat menconcentrated on certain validitiesattaining an exact and diversified terminologyhave there displayed considerable penetrationthat this was carried into early Italian poetryand faded from it when metaphors became decorative instead of interpretativeand that the age of Aquinas would not have tolerated sloppy expression of psychology concurrent with the exact expression ofmysticism There is also great wisdom in OvidPassons De Gourmont s wisdom is not wholly unlike the wisdom which those ignorant of Latin mayif the gods favour their understandingderive from Golding sMetamorphoses vBarbarian ethics proceed by general taboosGourmant s essays collected into various volumes PromenadesEpilogues etc are perhaps the best introduction to the ideas of our time that any unfortunatesuddenly emerging from PeruPeoriaOshkoshIcelandKochin or other out of the way lost continent could desireA set of Landor s collected works will go further towards civilizing a man than any university education now on the marketMontaigne condensed renaissance awarenessEven so small a The Little Review 7 collection as Lionel Johnson sPost Liminiummight save a man from utter barbarityBut iffor examplea raw graduate were contemplating a burst into intellectual companyhe would be less likely to utter unutterable betisesgaffesetc after reading Gourmont than beforeOne cannot of course create intelligence in a numbskullNeedless to sayGourmont s essays are of uneven value as the necessary subject matter is of uneven valueTaken togetherproportionately placed in his workthey are a portrait of the civilized mindI incline to think them the best portrait availablethe best record that is of the civilized mind from 1885 1915There are plenty of people who do not know what the civilized mind is likejust as there are plenty of mules in England who did not read Landor contemporaneouslyor who did not in his day read MontaigneCivilisation is individualGourmont arouses the senses of the imaginationpreparing the mind for receptivitiesHis wisdomif not of the sensesis at any rate via the sensesWe base ourscienceon perceptionsbut our ethics have not yet attained this palpable basisIn 1898 PAYS LOINTAIN reprinted from magazine publication of 1892 4 De Gourmont was beginning his method Douze crimes pour l honneur de l infini He treats the special casecases as

Valette sLe Viergethan any other book mentioned Etre nul arrêté dans son développement vers une nullité équilibrée We find typical Gourmont in the essay on Rictus Ici c est l idée de la résignation qui trouble le Pauvrecomme tant d autresil la confond avec l idée bouddhiste de non activitéCela n a pas d autre importance en un temps où l on confond toutet où un cerveau capable d associer et de

littérateursSi les Goncourt étaient devenues populairessi la notion du style pouvait pénétrer dans les cerveaux moyensOn dit que le peuple d Athêne avait cette notionEt surtout quel mémorable désintéressementEn tout autre temps nul n aurait songé à louer Edmond de Goncourt pour ce dédain de l argent et de la basse popularitécar l amour est exclusif et celui qui aime l art n aime que l artmais après les exemples de toutes les avidités qui nous ont été donnes depuis vingt ans par les boursiers des lettrespar la coulisse de la littératureil est juste et nécessaire de glorifieren face

stylec est bon pour un Bemboqui use d une langue facticeLe style peut se fatiguer comme l homme mêmeil vieillira de même que l intelligence et la sensibilité dont il est le signemais pas plus que l individuil ne changera de personalitéà moins d un cataclysme psychologiqueLe régime alimentairele séjour à la campagne ou à Parisles occupations sentimentales et leurs suitesles maladies ont bien plus

tomberaient en langueursans les voyages en Europe de leur aristocratieans la diversité extrême des climatsdes sols et par conséquent des races en évolution dans ce vaste empireLes échanges entre peuples sont aussi nécessaires à la revigoration de chaque peuple que le commerce social à l exaltation de l énergie individuelleOn n a pas pris grade à cette nécessité quand on parle avec regret de l

Manning STYLE IS a subject of peculiar interest in connection with Mde Gourmontnot only because he has dealth with it from a variety of aspectsand always in a fertile and suggestive waybut also because he is himself a master of styleand of a style singularly personal and characteristicsingularly distinct from that of his contemporariesand even from what we imagine to be the secular genius of French proseIt is a style that is fluid rather than finepervasive rather than penetratingand richer in the qualities of atmospherethat is to say of landscape paintingthan in those of outline and hard formIfas Mde Gourmont holdsthe aesthetic sense arises from the interaction of sensibility and intellectthen in his own prose perhaps the element of sensibility preponderatesIt is a feminine prosewe have only to compare it to the male and splendidly Objective writing of Mérimée to discern the fact at onceOf courseit is impossible to separate entirely the form from the contexta refinement of thought leads to a corresponding refinement of stylebutwhile an image or idea exists in the mind as a complete wholeof which the characteristics and qualities may be seized upon instantaneouslythese characteristics and qualities can only be presented in language successivelyThe work of the artist is thus an analysis between two syntheses arid it is during this process when the idea is being decomposedand descends as it were through the sensesthat it comes under the influences of those imponderabilia which give it the qualities of styleStylein shortis characterand it is proportionately to the rapidity and ease with which the idea traverses and burns up the material through which it is expressed that a style approaches perfectionIt may be grave and 20 The Little Review

to verge upon gesturebut even under these conditionswhere an explosive violence taks the place of easestyle maintains itself as the impress of characterWhen we describe Mde Gourmont s style as femininewe imply that it is passiveIt is not passionateit is not mimeticit does not approach to the conditions of actionIt is smoothclearlimpid like an unruffled sheet of waterin some formal gardenreflecting the skycloudstreesa marble mythologyand the yellow bricks of some decorous château with the late sunlight falling on it in the backgroundNow and again its polished surface reflects the figures of men and womenmen leisurely and indifferentwomen in clear coloursthey come and go rather indolentlyand the mirror keeps its serene and equal calmUnder the shadowy reflections we can even fathom its cool green depthsIt is feminine because it is so completely reflectiveWe feel that each of these vague and frail personifications has studied theidealistphilosophers from Berkeley to Nietzscheand that their action is simply the appreciation of those theories to realityThe peril of sin and the luxury of repentance are alike denied to those who are beyond good and evilThere are no divine and irrational elements in their livesMde Gourmontit goes without sayingis also an idealistbut after a manner of his ownWe do not remember that he mentions Protagorasa philosopher who had sufficient wit to leave no system behind himbut only some arresting fragmentsOne saying of ProtagorasHoweverthat man is the measure of all thingsis perhaps the root of Mde Gourmont s idealismand anotherthat we cannot know whether the gods exist or notsupplies the irreligionWhat is so curious in a disciple of Schopenhauer and of Nietzschewho merely The Little Review 21 inverted Schopenhaueris that Mde Gourmont practically ignores the will to liveIt only subsists in an extremely attenuated mode in his thoughtwhich is concerned mainly with the world as representationThis is surely a feminine traitWherever man has invented a theory of fatalismand idealism is onehe has been driven to provide a counterpoise to itBuddhismwhich so strongly affected Schopenhauerassumes a power of denying lifeand of ultimate release from the tyranny of the sensesChristian theologyfor which Mde Gourmont has perhaps too facile and instinctive a contemptopposes to predestinaion the doctrine of free willand to NietzscheSchopenhauer s dithyrambic disciplewill is the sole thing necessaryBut Mde Gourmont treats of it by implicationand as an example we may take his note on aesthetic L idée de beauté a une origine emotionelieelle se ramène à l idée de procréation La beauté est si bien sexuelle que les seules oeuvres d art incontestées sont celles qui montrent tout bonnement le corps humain dans sa nuditéPar sa persévérance à demeurer purement sexuellela statuaire grecque s est mise pour l éternité au dessus de toutes les discussions There is something unexpectedly naïve and charming in the statementcoming from one who denies an absolute beautyas he denies an absolute truthAu dessus de toutes les discussionsit has almost the force of a dogmaOne tries to imagine Mde Gourmont explaining to an intelligent Chinese that the beauty ofsaythe Victory in the Louvre est purement sexuelle With the exception of AphroditeGreek sculptures of women and goddesses are invariably veiledand one of the chief excellences of Greek artists consists precisely in their treatment of windy and flowing peploiIt is the male form which the Greeks represented usuallyin its nakednessbut we can see no reason why its beauty should be considered as bound up with the notion of procreationThe preoccupation with sex is lessprobablyin men than in womenand even though the instinct in the male be fiercer and more imperiousit is a momentaryeven a casual instinctwhich concernsitself little with the futureEtymologically the Greek word and the German Kunstboth of which carry with them a sense ofbegetting seem to support Mde Gourmontand sotoomight the rootar but etymology is a reedIf we return to the most primitive forms of human culturewe do not find that the idea of beauty is inseparably bound up with the idea of procreationThe Aruntaa tribe of 22 The Little Review Australian blackshave a rudimentary notion of aestheticssince they perform certain sacred dancesa fact implying a sense of rhythmbut with this tribe the idea of sex is entirely separated from the idea of reproductionthey are unable to connect the cause and effectbut to them every birth is the result of some spiritual or demonic agencyIt is obviously an erroneous notionbut the Arunta are also idealistsafter their own mannerTo a savage tribe existing under precarious conditions the fertility of the earth is of more pressing importance than the reproduction of their own kindandexcept for religious restrictions and taboossex involves no problems for themit is a simplea casualalmost a fortuitous matterComplex and elaborate civilisations create artificial conditionsin which sex is thwartedor over developedowing to socialeconomic or hygienic conditionsand from these conditionsa derangement of the nervous systeman acute sensibility to coloursto odoursto every form of sensationmay ariseIt is a form of decadenceTo a certain extent Mde Gourmont admits a norm of beautyIl faut que la femelle qui sera la mere soit conforme au type de la racec est à dire il faut qu elle soit belle and he quotes Père Buffierwho would find beautythat is conformity to the racial typein a composite photographwith approvalbut if such a norm existthen the aberrations of a decadent sensibility are irrelevantWe do not deny a sexual element in the aesthetic ideaWe deny only that sex is the unique source from which our aesthetic sense derives its beingand we consider it unsoundphysiologicallyto isolate a particular group of nerve centres from the rest of the motor sensory systemand to claim for this group powers and functions which it does not and cannot exercise independenly of the whole systemMde Gourmont has some doubt himselfand later in the same essay he enlarges the question Deux sortes d émotions concourent à la formation du sens esthétiqueles émotions génésique et toutes les autres émotions We approached the question of sexual influence upon the aesthetic idea in its relation to the will to liveand reproduction is only one of the many forms of expression in which the will manifests itselfManbesides being a loveris a hunter and a warriorhe is a creature of actionavid of experiencePhysiologicallyman is characterised by the

healedThe hands of man have taught many things to his mindPoetryalone in fine artis not their workbut with that exception every form of art has come from the hands of manOur actual vision of a painting is of colours upon a plane surfacebut by unconsciously referring this particular sense impression to past experience of touchwe infer qualities of form and texture in the representationThere

material of natureand one of the earliest expressions of will in this connectionis the practiceamong primitive peoplesof magical rites and ceremoniesMagic is mainly sympatheticand seeks to produce its effects by imitationTragedy can be traced back to its originin the sacred dances of savage and primitive tribesand the term tragedy covers the elements of which it was composednot only dramatic and lyric poetrybut the orchestic attitudes and gestures of the mimesand naturally musicFrom the same origin are derived the Odes of Pindardefinitely religious in characterand closer to their source since they celebrate victories in gameswhich were originally sacred observances to ensure fertilitynot only in the soilbut in the cattle and the peopleSo far we may agree with Mde Gourmont that beauty is bound up with the idea of reproduc24 The Little Review tionfor it is the beauty and nobility of race the genius of alternate generations which Pindar celebratesand the games originally took place at

ivory and hornsuch as those discovered in the cave dwellings of the drift men in Francedo not seem to have any religious or magical significancebut our evidence for this period is slightand on the other hand we have the representations of totemsthe flatcarven and incised tikis of the Maoristhe use of pigments on carvingand many indications that the savage and primitive mind attributes to these objectsand even to their implements and weaponsan almost personal character of their ownIn any casethe art of painting was profoundly influenced by the action and gesture of sacred dances and ritual gamesThe will has two objectivesthe extension as in the notion of immortalityand the intensification of its experience and actionthe will to live and the will to powerMagic was an attempt to attain these objectivesThe egotism of the individual is not compensated for its extinction in deathby any consideration of the continuous life of the racebutin the celebration of orgiastic tribal ritesman

child of Poe as to bring with him that veritably American savour which Laforgue detected in Baudelaire when he called himChat Hindou Yank Resemblance not necessarily derived from Baudelaire s translation of theTales of Mystery and Imagination That was anatmospheric analogy but the relation between De Gourmont and Poe is one undoubtedly of direct influence hatchment 30 The Little Review

complementaryThey are worldlyphysical more and yet less than Poe s womenMorella and Berenice belong to a period when vapours were the correct thingCyrane belongs to a modern Paris with apotheosis of vitalityPoe s preoccupation with dissolution and the grave has to our minds distinctly its absurd sidebut this is due to a change in poetic subject matter amenable to periods as all else witness the ElizabethansDe Gourmont never does thisDeath for him is part of life a continuation to Poe it was an endan end so stableso metallic and fianl that it could not be said to belong to a world in fluxIt is in the business of psychological writing they most differTo conceive of Poe writingLe Songe d une FemmeorVisages de femmesis impossiblefor he always came up against a wall with the problem of a physical life which was not in process of decompositionHe appeared to have no knowledge of what I would call normal subconsciousness the motives underneath most of every day lifeFor processes of abnormal subconsciousness he is of course without peerDe Gourmont hardly ever touches this regionThose who have readPehorwill understand what I meanbut in this story the first of theHistoires Magiques there appear to be all the physical and psychological detail so unaccountably omitted from the stories of Berenice and MorellaCertainly Pehor is complementary to themI suspect that part of De Gourmont smissionwas to fill in the holes left by PoeCertainly they illuminate each otherare The Little Review 31 commentary and exegesisand one cannot be said to know either without knowing his complementDe Gourmont has been said to be most different from Poe in thePromenades Littérairesand the ImpressionsI do not think this is trueCertainly they show a mind capable of the most original research in science and philosophy as apart from purely literary achievementIf you likethe flight is more sustained but never loftierfor throughout the seventeen volumes of miscellaneous writings attributed to Poe are to be found most profound observations in the psychologyphilosophy and science of his timeThe result is an impression of a mindone of the most stupendous known to usHow well read both men were in the obscure and magicalI have only the glimmeringsbut it was sufficiently formidableand if Poe does no interpolate Hebrew into his writings it is because he wrote as a journalist and not like De Gourmontas a potential member of the AcademyThe problem of an aesthetic exercised each Le Pèlerin du SilenceI would put against theDomain of ArnheimandThe Thousand and Second Nightand leave the reader to draw comparisonsNor has De Gourmont ever surpassed the description of the interior of the young man s palace inThe Assignationthe Rimbaud like purity of the so well known soliloquy To muse for long unwearied hoursand how much more remarkable Poe s preoccupation seems when it is remembered that it took place in a barbarous countryone to which Whitman was infinitely more suitedDe Gourmont worked

Remy de GourmontBack in those days before the delugewhat was it he meant to usWhy was the nameRemy de Gourmontso potentso sure of our respectRemy de GourmontI thinkmeant to us the type of the artistthe man who lives purely to create the work of art and to whom nothing else is of essential importanceHe saysobviously of himselfin one of his early works He thinks about nothing but literature and cares only for style He wronged himselfyet there is just this much truth in the motthat he cared for art passionately and as an artistHe wanted to write good proseother things seemed not particularly to matterBut he meant something more than artistry and disinterested devotionhe meant very much moreHe meant freedom and the use of the intelligence in the bravest freest wayHe meant wit and irony and profundity of thoughttrue learning and the understanding of human naturehe meantto use his own words the tradition of untrammelled minds And he was a kind of pattern to usWhat Remy had endured for the sake of freedom of speechto keep clean his artist s consciencewe could endurehaving his approval we felt confident in the futureTo lose him by death was to lose one of the few among our elders whose approval was worth havingHis work I divide roughly and mentally into four periodsThe obscure beginningsthe period of erudition andword mosaics the period of Flaubertian cynicismthe resolution to be a great demoraliserand the last period when he sought what the Greek meant by the wordsophrosyne The first period does not really concern us except to note that de Gourmont learned the art of writing slowlyHe wanted his early books forgottenIt is not for us to rake from oblivion such works The Little Review 33 asChez les Lapons Somewhere he speaks of the day when his dissatisfaction with his own work and with the work of the time received direction from his reading a periodical just brought out by some young men who called themselves by the fantastic title ofles Symbolistes He readA Reboursfantoche fameuxhe called des Esseints in later years then the authors praised in that work and more of the young contemporariesThis would be about the middle of the eightiesAt that time he beganLe Latin Mystique which took him several years to bring to completionRemy relatesnot without malicethat he carried his manuscript to Huysmans whose remarks on church Latin had suggested the bookHe found Huysmansun fonctionnaire parfait startled to find that anyone had actually readtranslated and criticised these poets Huysmans got his information out of Elbert s manualOne might trace a certain ironic bitterness in de Gourmont to this discovery of artistic humbug in a man he had hitherto respected and championedThe two never actually quarrelled but when Huysmans became a Catholic he was spirited away from Remy by pious friends who feared the effects of the young man s brilliant scepticismAbout this time too he producedSixtine a novel of the imagination which gave him the entry to the Mercure de Franceand played with words delicately and skillfullygiving us theLitaniesand the pieces inLe Pèlerin du Silence But beautiful and curious as these works were they did not move a Hugo soaked publicAll the notice he received from official sources was dismissal from the Bibliothèque Nationale for a so called unpatriotic article perhaps the greatest service the state could render him as it made him for ever anindependent but undoubtedly the reason why his books were never really popularHere comes in the third periodthe Flaubertian maxim being worked at first with enthusiasmthen gradually abandonedWe getLes Chevauz de Diomede exquisite book for those who will ponder its wisdomLe Songe d une Femme the beginnings of his cynical worklargely journalisticTheFlaubertian maxim Simply that the man of intelligence revenges himself upon a dull world bycorruptingitFlaubert put his hatred intoBouvard et PécuchetGourmont spread his

sensations of the foot ball field when a freshman in high schoola slightly built boy of sixteenI felt eager to get on the teamI was too light but I knew something of the game from playing on back lots and I wanted to playI am not braveI knew then that I was not braveI wanted to play and I playedThey put me in at end on the scrubAlmost at once the varsity came around my end and I was knocked aside and discardedI was satisfied to be put outI was convinced by the feel of the knees and feet that struck me that I was too lightit seemed stupid to me to attempt to continueLife off the football field was a thing I did not wish to break so cheaplyPerhaps I exaggeratedthe dangera braver man might have done betterbut in any case I acted according to the situation as I saw itpainfully consciouslyOnce later I was hit in the stomach going through the lineI thought I should never breathe againNothing but repeated spasmodic grunts escaped my mouth and no air in themI could hear this loud exhaust as a thing completely outside myselfI couldn t stop itMy brother stood over medisturbed by family prideand told me to shut upI couldn tI didn t careIt meant nothing to meI didn t mind whether they thought me brave or a cowardThere was a distinct satisfaction in the involuntary nature of the sound that came from my mouthI was relieved of the necessity of pretending to be braveMy brother thought I was putting it onI remember too in college a fellow in my class who out of an excess of college spirit played on the scrub four years without the slightest hope of advancement to the first teamHe was not a good player and he was too lightHe went about during the playing season almost always bruised about the eyes and with a severe limpI wanted to play on the varsityI often compared my bare body The

the work of genius that MrJames Douglas of the Star commented on the death notice of Gaudier by writing that the perpetrators of Blast carried a joke too far in printing pretended death notices of these invented madmenIt is also significant of what the Americanaesthetic public as engineered by the relicts ofthe nineties will swallow that the celebrated aesthetic publisher and book pirate

The Little Review When one mentions simple facts of this sortidiots say that you areembittered and when you call a block head a block head he can not believe youhe usually says that you are clever but insincereIndeed I find it harder to convince a man that you really think him an assno matter how obvious his inanitythan to convince him of any other proposition whatsoeverEt pourtant there are people whom one does quite quietly and sincerely and placidly believe to be thoroughly stupidinane and insipidAnd Vorticism has not yet had its funeralGaudier was killed at Neuville StVaast in 1915The memorial exhibition of his work in London last summer received from all quarters the appreciation due in his lifetimeIt may be said that after trying all kinds of naval camouflage without satisfaction the government has at last put a vorticist lieutenant in charge of the biggest port in Englandthat the French aesthetic camouflagists working on theory and at a distance from the sea bordare unsatisfactory and that their work has to be correctedI shall not go into the detail of the vorticist improvement of the earlier impressionist systemssuffice it that in dealing with actual modernity the new art has proved its contentionsand that where actual knowledge of how the human eye is affected by colours and patterns in relationwhere there is some standard of judgment other than that of half educated dilettantivorticist hard headedness has made goodAfter trying all kinds of war painterswithfor the most partlamentable or at any rate negligible resultsthe government has taken on

to Robert so if she falls from his respect for conventional standards he squares himself with himselfYou ll see what I m trying to say stated clearly in McDougall sSocial Psychologyin his analyses of the self regarding sentimentand of the sentiments of reproach it s a sort of subjectiveinvertedvicarious reproachDostoevsky plays this whole gamut beautifully inThe Eternal Husband Of course I m taking only an element in the analysiswith the rest I agree with you in the main I should like to go into this with you at lengthif there were any time or lull in the running of a magazineAnd I think where you miss is to take a second premise for a first and call it an obvious thingYou call Richard an old philandererbut I am letting that go by and trying to show why he is a philandererthough the common usuage of this word can have no concern with RichardIn his effort to make some so called normal connection with life he may have been conventionally untrue to Bertha and Robertbut it is his unfaithfulness to himself in these episodes that makes his suffering so greatNormal sexany sex is not for hima law of nature which he did not voteas he saidHe repudiates the truth of his participation in any of this philanderingNothing that Bertha or Robert could ever think of himno matter how deeply they could fall into his faultnothing could affect his self regarding sentimentHis self regarding sentiment is as absolute as his sex positionand is affected only seeminglyHe comes home late in the night after a debauch and kneels beside Bertha s bed and confesses all his wanderingsShe hasthrough her lovebecome Richard as I pointed out in my previous articleShe lives apart from all sex lifeshe is to him a pure manifestation of himselfBy these confessions he puts away the loathsome experiencesputs them on this physically pure self and can again be free and reestablished in his true psychic positionIf I were Remy de Gourmont I might be able to tell you all I think about the

JepsonLondonWith regard to the letters of Miss Harriet Monroethe editress of PoetryI wrote to her at the end of 1917 to ask her if she would like an appreciation of recent United States poetryShe wrote that she wouldsent me twenty eight numbers of her magazineranging over three yearsand in those numbers marked the typically United States poemsSo much for theuninvited and undesiredinvasionI read those marked poems and taking three of them to which Poetry had awarded a prize in each of those three yearsas typical of the typicalI dealt chiefly with themI saidas politely as my outraged aesthetic sensibilities would allowthat they were punkI quoted enough of them to demonstrate that they were punkand punk they areNeither Miss Harriet Monroe nor any of her supporters made any attempt whatever to counter a single one of my criticismsto demonstrate that the punk I said was punk was not punkThey burst into a storm of irrelevant abuse of meMiss Harriet Monroe s article in Poetry was just abuse of meMrAustin Harrison told me that the article she sent to the English Review was just abuse of meA MrBurton Roscoe s article in the Chicago Tribune was just abuse of meThat is merely sillyThe Little Review 63 All they had to do was to demonstrate that such lines asThen Uncle Tom to Eva flewLurching bravos from the ditches dankHis hair was black as a sheep s wool that is blackShe knew you had the madness for Arabelare poetryWhy didn t they do itIn the same article I wrotequite fairlythat in MrTSEliot the United States has a great poetI quoted enough of his workthe whole ofLa Figlia Che Piange to demonstrate that he is the greatest master of emotionintensityand the beautiful music of words the United States has produced since PoeMiss Monroe archly wrote that MrEliot must have winked when he read itImpayableBy the wayI did not write that MrEdgar Frost sSnowwas amaundering burble I wrote that it wasmaundering dribble It isWith regard to jh s articlesI have no doubt that she is a very earnest ladybut I wish she would begin to thinkIt is obvious that where you have verseyou have an exercise of the aesthetic activity and a legitimate occasion for aesthetic criticismThe fact that the exercise of that activity is so poor that the verse has no more to do with poetry than it has with rat catching merely renders an aesthetic criticism of it the more expedientOf course I never said anyhing so silly as thatthe technical activity is the prime activity of Art I said that Art is in the handlingand that is wholly trueWhat is the use from the creative point of viewof jh sintuition of beautyto a man if he cannot give it formHe may have all the perception of beauty possible to a human beingbut if he canont handle that perception so as to give it its right form he is neither a poeta musiciana sculptoror a painterAgain the phrasethe Poet s vision of the worldis notthe threadbare terminology of half baked criticism it is an uncommonly actual factThe poet s vision of the world is an actual and most important part of himMoreover it is a good concrete phrase and very much safer than jh sintuition of beauty which begs a very important questionAlso I propose to go on asserting that the poetry of MrTSEliot is the fine flower of the United States spirit of to day because that is exactly what it isAgain my discussion of voices was wholly pertinentIf you will go on Whining or droning through your noses you will remain deaf 64 The Little Review to the music of words and you never will write poetryor know it when you get itWithout the music of words there is no poetryYou may print the words in any arrangement you likethey remain just proseI believe that this deafness is the reason why the bulk of the versifiers of the United States sprang so lithely on free verseit supplied a long felt wantFinally why are you Yankees so infernally touchyYou may say any mortal thing you like about any English writer of verse you like and I shall not turn a hairDoes your touchiness come from the consciousness that your airs of aesthetic superiority are not justified by your aesthetic achievement and I called your bluffIf it does you are quite rightIn the matter of aesthetic achievement the United States is last on the roll of the civilized nations of all timeIt s poets and painters had to be Europeanized before they could attain their aesthetic maturityThe important thing is that you are going to stay where you areif you will persist in humbugging yourselves thatHis hair was black as a sheep s wool that is blackis poetry because it was written in Keokuk I can t do any more about this Jepson episodeIt isn t interesting to any one not worth the space and paper given to itBut a point or two may be discussed here as well as anywhere elseAlmost anyone but MrJepsonit would seemcould have gathered from the various articles ofjust abusethat thetouchinessdidn t have much to do with any attack on ourairs of aesthetic superiorityorachievement and I don t think that the present aesthetic activities of either England or America of enough importance for an international controversyIt wasn t any of thisit was really a protest against MrJepson as a criticWe have enough of thisswinging the bladder this plain business suit criticism of poetry right here in AmericaWe are kindly told that criticism is badly neededbefore the UScan export works of Art instead of exporting artists We ll admit all thisbut we can t see why we should find ourselves in a street fight for protesting against importsWe ll admit all and anything about our aesthetic achievementwe have some sense of tragedy if we aren t granted any sense of humourbut the thing turns on a superstition held by us that criticism also is an art and we scarcely have The Little Review room or patience for any more like JepsonWe don t need to import that kind of criticismI thought when I used the expressionintuition of beautythat I was addressing myself to intelligences somewhat past the schoolboy stageThe making of a work of Art is an act of worshipan acknowledgement to form in the absoluteit is also an outward sign to other men that the artist has had this contactThe artist s perception of beauty concerns only formForm is what he has seen whereother men see only the context of the worldHe has been made aware of formand this he presentsusing whatever subject material his personal manifestation dictatesIf it isn t form that he has seenno amount of handling can make any perception of a beautiful context into a work of ArtBut I am not writing a treatise on aestheticsneither am Iearnestlyarguing with MrJepsonA very facetious and wholly ridiculous demonstration with convincing illustrations on the phonograph could be made of MrJepson s beautiful voice beautiful poetry obsessionI hope I haven t misquoted any of MrJepson s phrasesFor the sake of a little exactness in all controversy let me call attention to a too sensitive leap on Miss Monroe s part in referring to Pound s note on Jepson s first article in the Little ReviewObserve that Pound did not mention Poetry at alljh An Offer If there are people who wish to make money in an easy and
