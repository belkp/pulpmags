fragile wings The Little Review 3What We Are Fighting ForMARGARET CANDERSONE been much criticised for an article on Gabrilowitsch in the lastissueI have been told rather violently that I didn t know what I was talking aboutthat to say Gabrilowitsch had stood still artistically or that the music critics were deaf because they didn t like Scriabin s Prometheus was simply to brand TH E LITTLE REVIEW again as the kind of magazine which delights in any sort of snap shot judgment that may sound startling ornew But the fact of the matter is this if TH E LITTLE REVIEW is ready to stand behind any of its judgmentsand it is very ready I can think of nothing that has appeared which I will so eagerly and convincingly defend as that article on Gabrilowitsch or my remark that Prometheus was extraordinarily beautifulI canprovethe first in at least three waysand I have some one in minda Russianwho will write a poem on his reactions to Prometheus that will make you all wish you had imaginations too But this is not importantIt merely leads me to an announcement of a series of articles a sort of campaign that we have been planning for the last two monthsIf we are to prove that we have a realfunctionit will be this of depreciating values that have ceased to be important and appreciating new ones that have emerged oras I should sayvalues that are about to become unimportant and those that are about to emergeIn view of such a function I am quite willing to agree with my critics that the Gabrilowitsch article wasn t worth anythingit merely stated things that are already quite well knownand a magazine that means to announce transvaluations before the approximate ten year period during which even the uninspired come to accept them has no business to concern itself with mere restatementsOf course the most frequent criticism brought against TH E LITTLE REVIEW is that it goes to artistic and emotional and intellectual lengths no well balanced person wants to goI only wish this were trueI meanwe haven t gone any real lengths and that is just what s the matter with usW e have made statements that seemed fearfully radical and new to a lot of people who don t know what s going on in the world and I m afraid we have listened to these people and tried toconvertthemWe have wanted to convince everybody particularly those who seemed to need it mostAnd there is nothing more fatal because what everybody thinks doesn t matter what a few think matters tremendouslyI was brought up with a shock the other dayat an editors meeting when Lucien Cary said that though TH E LITTLE REVIEW had one of the requisites of the ideal magazineyouthit had the wrong kind of youth the kind that has not yet caught up instead of the kind that has gone aheadAfter trying to face that squarely for five awful minutes I was forced to decide that he was rightI4 The Little Reviewmean in this way I know the quality of our youth is all rightjust as I know that people who write true things and live false ones are all wrongbut the wisdom of it is quite another matterAnd one of our big mistakes has been a hope that preaching will help There s nothing pompous in saying that the thoughts of only a few people matterThis has always been so and always will beEvery new valuation has come about just that way championed by a group and then endorsed by a majority long after it has ceased to matter muchBut for a magazine that means to count wellI can t decide whether our predicament of having got into a sort of Billy Sunday slump is humorous or very sadHereafter we shall pretend that there are no impossibilists in our audience But the announcement In each of the future issues of TH E LITTLE REVIEWbeginning with June if possiblewe shall have a special article attacking current fallacies in the arts or in life getting down to the foundationsEach one will be written by a person who knows thoroughly what he is talking aboutand each will betrue and memorable to use Will Comfort s good phraseFor instancesuppose we begin with the modern theatreIt will be interesting to find why Clayton Hamilton calls a play as falseas distortedas unwholesome and demoralizing as The Shadow a great dramaand why Percy Hammondwho is looked upon even by some of the discerning as a critic worthy to be trusted in the work of spreading ideasshould have nothing but superlatives for the same outrage To do him justiceMrHammond did modify his praise with a single naive sentence I could find some flaws in The Shadow and thento put his other foot in but the playing glossed them over until they were forgivable which is precisely the crime and tragedy of such productions This type of intellectual blundering is apparent everywhere among the critics of literatureof musicof artof the dramaand among the strangest of all human creatures the historians men who reserve their judgments for a hundred years and the philosophersmen whose judgments are good for everything except to live by If you happen to be equipped with knowledge of the intricate hypocrisies of the music schoolsor the way the newspapers treat a competent art criticor the methods of a manager in making a good play a bad oneor how dissatisfied the railyway employees really are or ought to be send us an article on the subjectThe conditions of acceptance are these You must know English prose you must write it as though you are talking instead of writingyou must say quite frankly and in detail the things you would not be allowed to say in the prostitutedsubsidizedor uninteresting magazines and you must be trueThis begins our warfareEcho Translated from the German of Fritz Schnack by William Saphier Into the forest your voice flew Clear and light as a bird from its nestFrom your mouth the sound departed

COMFORTThe quickened pulse of America did not appear with the outbreak of warIt came with the winter coldlike all revival spirit a strange and fervent heatbreaking down the oldvitalizing the new everywhereNo one doubts now no one who can tear his eyes from the ground even for a little doubts now that the new social order is upon us Americain opening her breasts to the agony of Europein her giving of solids and sympathyhas stumbled upon the ancient and perfect formula for receiving the greater goodIn forgetting herself a littleher own human spirit has been ignited If someone announced that there lived in the Quattor Islands a man who knew the exact way to bring into the worldnot only the spiritbut the action of brotherhood and fatherlandthere would be some call for maps and steamship passagesIf the Quattor Islands were not already on the mapsthey would presently appearbut not before the earliest pilgrims had set outAnd if someone should add that all expression of the arts so far in the world is wumbled and imperfect compared to that which is about to beif a certain formula is followed and that this man in the Quattor group has the formula many more would start on the questor send their most trusted secretaries And yet the truth and the way is all hereand has been uttered again and again by every voice that has lifted itself above the common din The wise men carried giftsYou would expect to give something for the secretYou might expect to be called upon to sell all you have and give to the poorYou would not be surprised even if the magnetic Islander saidIt is not your frankincense and myrrh that I wantthough I thank youThat which I have is for youI am more anxious for you to know and live itthan you can be to have and hold itBut the mystery is that it will not come to abide with youwhile you are passionate for possessionThe passion to give to others must be established within you before you can adequately receiveYou are beginning to see how

changeand it is only through such changes that the material stagnation of a people can be relieved without deluges of blood The high hope is upon usIn being apart from warAmerica has been enabled to

is the most significant fact since EmersonWhitmanand Thoreautook pen in hand forgetting themselves a little while each dayThere is a peculiar strength upon American production of all kindsas a result of this very act of getting out from under European influence England and France and Germany are merely national voices nowThe voice of the partisan is but a weak treble against the basic rumble of

parts of the civilized worldYet he has not a large circulation and a purely commercial writer would probably be disgusted at his profitsbut he has an influenceespecially over the younger and more adventuresome spiritswhich few writers today possessOne can or rather one could in the days before the war hardly pick up any French review without finding some reference to his ideas or some criticism of his workIn Russia he appears to have a more considerable reputation than anywhere else outside FranceForthough one sees criticism and translations of him even in languages like Hungarian and Roumanianit is in Russia alone that a word of praise from Remy de Gourmont seems to make a man s reputationThe English are far slower in their international appreciationsand the Americans quick though they are to seize on new men do not seem to have taken up de Gourmont with much understandingMrRansome s translation of Un Nuit au Luxembourg was not received with either appreciation or enthusiasm by English and American criticsAnd though a savant like MrHavelock Ellis quotes from Mde Gourmont s workand hasI believea great admiration for his personal intellectual qualities though MrSturge Moorein his book on Flaubert and Blakequotes Mde Gourmont among the great critics of Franceit must be admitted that few English speaking critics have yet done him justiceI question if the larger public has heard more of him than a vague rumour of his nameIt may be that he is thought toohigh brow I suppose every man who gives his life up to the task of expressing his ideashis characterand his genius in a purely disinterested manner is liable to this crticismBut there is so great a fascination in his workwhether it be criticism or fictionphilosophic dialogue or prose poemthat whenever he gains a reader it is not for an hour but for lifeIn America especially he should find readersfor Americawhatever artistic faults and drawbacks it may havehas notas England hasaringof reviewers who unanimouslyqueerany book whose originality or genius is any menace to their own stick in the mud critical methodsThe Symbolist movement in France is now almost ancient historyUnanimistsFuturistsParoxystsFantasistsand all the otheristsso abundantly produced by this century now face theistsof Germany on the battlefieldAnd while they are there fighting out by bodily force and not by words the intellectual destinies of Europe we may perhaps consider with free minds the Symbolist poets and authors who are now too old to take the field for their country and can only sit at homewaiting for newsSome of thechildren of Mallarméare dead others are forgotten a few still remainMaeterlinckVielé GriffinJammesand Remy de Gourmont occur first to one s mind as the best living representatives of the great Symbolist schooland of these the subtlestthe most fascinatingthe most modern is Remy de GourmontAlong with MAnatole Francethough very different from himRemy de Gourmont is an example of thetradition of European cultureLess derivative than MFranceor perhaps deriving from less familiar sourceswith as great an irony and with a faith that seems more sceptical than scepticism itselfhe has extracted from the literature of each country and century that part which helped him to develop and train his own characterHe presents in one person the manifold and often conflicting opinions and ideas of modern cultureReading his books one sees that there is a mystical sort of beauty even in science and under his pen mysticism itself appears almost as exact as a science I said just now that Mde Gourmont was an example of the tradition of European cultureand since Pariswe are mostly agreedis the centre of European cultureand since Remy de Gourmont is a Parisian of Parisianswe may count himI thinkas one of the best examples of Latin or West European culture now livingI rather dwell upon this aspect of Remy de Gourmont as the man of supreme culture since that quality has so suddenly and so startlingly come into public discussionIt is extremely difficult to say precisely what culture is and a definition of culture naturally varies with differences of race and temperamentsJohn Addington Symondsin his interesting and illuminating essay on this subjectdefines culture asthe raising of previously educated faculties to their highest potencies by the conscious effort of their possessors And it might be added to this excellent definition that the feature of Latin or West European culture which most distinguishes it from the culture of other countries is a wideness of interesta great generalcultivatingof all the faculties of the mind and character as opposed to the extreme development of one single faculty Remy de Gourmont is indeed so admirable an example of the type of culture I have briefly indicated that it is difficult to think of any form of intellectual activity which has not at one time or another received his attentionHe has been a founder of reviews among them the famous Mercure de France and an editor of reviewsHe has written prefaces for modern authors and for ancient authors both poets and prose writersAs a literary critic it is perhaps not too much to say that in his time and generation he ranks as Sainte Beuve did in hisUnder his name will be found five volumes of Promenades Littérairescollections of essays dealing with the widest possible range of literary subjects from Petronius to Guillaume de Machautfrom the Goliardi to the latestroman passionnel His Livres des Masques are one of the most considerable acquisitions to the criticism of French literature during the last quarter of the nineteenth centuryInThe Little Review These two books will be found amazingly penetrating studies of men so diverse as the de Goncourt brothers and Maeterlinckwhile American readers should be especially interested in his studies of the two Franco American poetsStuart Merrill and Francis Vielé GriffinAs an admirer of HuysmansMRemy de Gourmont was naturally interested in the mysticChristian Latin poetsAnd the fruit of several yearsstudy of these authors was that notable and unique book Le Latin MystiqueIt is no exaggeration to say that hardly anyone else could have made these writers interesting to anyone but the specialistOne can almost imagine Mde Gourmont being challenged to produce a book which would appeal not only to savants but to the lover of general cultureThis mystic Latin poetry haduntil Huysman s daybeen almost entirely neglected by students of beautiful thingsBut Remy de Gourmonttreating the subject as a poet in love with poetrynot as a pedant or a professor or a book maker has produced a work which is at once a criticism and an anthology of the literature produced during those thousand years which we ignorantly call theDark AgesThese investigations into an almost forgotten and strangely attractive literature were not without effect upon his purely creative workThis effect can be best seen in his Litaniesa series of curious andverballyextremely beautiful prose poemsfull of assonancesof internal rhymesof strange symbolsof sonorous rhythms and of fantastic imagesAgain in his prosein works like Le Pèlerin du Silence and D un Pays Lointainin his poetryespecially in Les Saints do Paradis this influence is most marked In books like La Physique de l AmourLe Chemin de Veloursthe series of Promenades Philosophiques and Epilogueswe have an entirely different kind of intellectual activity letteredit is truebut with that incisiveness and clarity of style and thought which mark French prose as the finest in the modern worldIn these books problems of philosophyof moralsof everyday conduct and national and international affairsproblems of musicof paintingof all the arts and sciencesare discussed with a brilliance and an originality not always palatable to the gloomier and duller elements of French society One must not ask for too clear a definition of Mde Gourmont s philosophyHe is just sufficient of a mystic to enjoy being misunderstoodand of a nature so ironical that his most innocent looking statements are traps for the unwaryHe is an individualist true to his type of culturePerhaps if he were very closely questioned he would smile and say that he belonged to thetradition des libres espritsIn addition to these many worksof so diverse a character that they might well be the result of the labours of several men rather than of onehe has written several novelsone or two of which at their appearance were the literary sensation of the hour he has devoted much time to the study of aesthetic questions and has published two or three volumes on the subject beyond all this he has produced a modern French rendering of Aucassin and Nicolettea translation from the Spanish and a couple of original plays And in his little flat on the rive gauchenot far from StSulpiceamong his bookshe still writes every day words of encouragement for anxious Parisstill finds time to observe and reflect and to let the rest of the world know what is happening in FranceWords Out of WakingHELEN HOYTIn the

to be captivated by the former and disappointed in the latterBut it turned out just the other wayMother Jones is all the things you have heard her to be vigorousalmost sprightly in her eighty two yearswittyshrewdkindlyhopeful of great social changeswith snappy little blue eyes and a complexion like a girl of eighteen and a tongue like an automatic revolverYou feel you d rather have her get after you with fire crackersas she did to a man in some Western hotel when she wanted to drive him out of townand succeeded than to have her side against you in an argumentRight or wrongshe would make you appear to be hopelessly wrongand certainly on any practical matter you would have a suspicion that she was right anyhowShe is consistent and convincingBut there is one thing none of the magazine articles has said about herMother Jones is a completely simple human beingin the least flattering sense of the wordShe suffers because men are sent to jail and children are killed in strikesand she spends every day of her life working toward the prevention of these thingsBut she lives on no more subtle plane of adjustments to a difficult universeYou can t associate her with any sort of intense personal struggleIf temperament is the capacity to reactas I heard some one define it the other daythen Mother Jones is as untemperamental a person as I ve ever seenShe actsshe doesn t react at allShe has neither a complex nor an interesting mind she has a well informed oneShe has read a lot chiefly history and economicsShe hasn t read philosophy or psychologyI thinkShe hasn t needed to her knowledge of psychology is that sweeping and rather crude kind that comes with years of hard experience in which there has been little time for observationIf you asked her to sympathize with a man who had killed himself because he loved too greatlyI can rather hear her say that if men would keep busy they wouldn t have time for such notionsLife to her is reduced to a matter of two antagonisms the struggle between Capital and LaborOther thingssuch as Artfor instancewellshe makes you feel it s a little impertinent to expect her to waste time like that she is too busy trying to outwit thedamned sewer rats as she calls Burnsdetectives or other obstacles to peace and freedomMother Jones has a lot of effective phrases of that sortI think she wants to see if she can make you blanch before she decides really to trust youand then of courseas she says My boys wouldn t understand me if I talked nice and ladylike all the time Underneath all this there is a charming old gentlewomanfull of delicatecourtesies that win for her the splendid chivalry of the rough men she spends her life among The man who took me to see her made an unfortunate remarkHe told her that I wanted to write an article about herand asked if she wouldn t tell me how she got started in her work I tried to stop him in timebut it was no use She gave me one scornful look and then flashed at him That s a woman s questionNo man ever asks me such a fool thingbut women always doHow do I know how I got startedI was always a worker that s all Another of her simplifications is that there are two kinds of people those who work and those who don tShe seemed to put me with the latterand it was my instinct from the first that she didn t approve of meShe just treated me politelyand it was rather awfulShe kept insisting that women know nothing about Labor which is almost quite true and of course she didn t neglect to mention her aversion for the suffragistsBut most of the time she told us storieschuckling heartily whenever she could say anything particularly explosiveShe described her recent trip to New Yorkand I remember her vivid account of a visit she made the Colony ClubShe said all the women came tripping in on high heelsbent forward at an ominous angle that made her think of cats ready to spring on a mouse I ve got no time for such idiots she finished And look at the crazy ones in this townwalking in a mayor s parade and yelling like wildcats instead of staying at home where they might be reading and learning to educate their childrenThat night we went to hear her talk to an organization of painters and found her irresistibleBut she did little except entertain them particularly with stories in which she herself figured as the white haired heroinewading across streams in water up to her waist to outwit the policeor forcibly throwing a Burns detective out of her audienceThe painters shrieked with joy at thatand it really was good to hearShe had suspected a certain man who had been going to her meetingsso one night she asked him to leaveHe refusedbut she insistedHe said I won t go and I d like to see anybody who can make meWell she answered we ll see about thatand she stepped down from the platformtook him by the throatheld him so tightlythat his tongue stuck out and marched him out of the hallHe didn t bother her any moreThese thingstold in her bluntsnappy wayare overwhelmingly funny and stirring tooBut what you like most about her is her sudden falling into seriousnessand the way she says Nowmy boysstick togetherSolidarity is the only method by which we can beat the systemMother Jones has no patience with anarchismDon t talk to me about philosophies of an ideal society that will happen some time long after I m in my graveWhat I m after is to do something for my class while I m still aliveI believe in accomplishing things She has none of the anarchist s hatred of government she merely wants our present system human The Little ReviewizedAnd she has a lot of little prejudices about people and things about Bill Haywoodfor instancewhodivides Labor against itself as she saysand says untruly On the whole she is just what you would have expected except that she s more amusingThere is absolutely nothing of the artist in herShe is imaginative in the large way a child is in fact Mother Jones is a child in the sense a grown up can t be without losing a lot Elizabeth Gurley Flynn the girl agitator has an even more consistent point of view than Mother Jonesand she has the advantage of being without prejudicesHer face has more subtletymore interest for the analystthan Mother Jones s obvious compressed mouth and quick eyes but it has little of that stamp of multiple reactions which make Emma Goldman s face such a fascinatingsubject There is a touch of Irish poetry in it something wistful and something stern Miss Flynn gave three talks on Birth Controlon Violence in Relation to the Labor Movementand on Solidarity Labor s Road to Freedombut I could only hear the last onewhich everyone said was the least interesting of the threeThere was only a handful of workers thereand she was so informing that the place ought to have been crowded with all the good people who think the IWWis an organization of unintelligent outcasts whose only competence lies in throwing hammers into printing pressesetc etcMiss Flynn is more articulate than any IWWI have heardand she is freer from the stock phrases that give so many of the very earnest young workers in the movement something of pathosI like these IWWpeople a lotThey are not only offering an efficient program of labor they are getting close to a workable philosophy of lifeThey are even capable of a virtue no working class organization is supposed to be overburdened with hardness of thoughtAs Miss Flynn saidDon t pamper yourselvesIt s not a sacrifice to fight for your own freedomOf course this group has its camp followers who do it no end of damage but then the Socialists have theirpracticalfanatics who are so awfully practical they always look at the trees instead of the forestand the Anarchists have their soulful members who yearn for martyrdom and blubber about the duty of suffering for a causeThe best of the Industrial Workers are neither visionless nor sentimentalThey have no interest in being martyrs they are workersMiss Flynn is of the best of these The Little Review 19The Poetry Bookshop 35 Devonshire StreetLondon AMY LOWELLremember the first time I went to the Poetry BookshopIt was in July1913I had read of it in a stray number of The Poetry Review that had drifted my wayThe idea attracted me at onceand I determined to have a look at it during the summerThere was something alluringly crazy about anyone s starting a bookshop for the sale of poetry alonePoetry is at once my trade and my religionAll decent poets worship their art and slave at itand I am no exception to the ruleBut I have myafternoons outwith their temptationsand the greatest of these is a bookshopHere was the combination a poetry bookshopI turned to it as inevitably as a magnet to the pole It was after a visit to one of those large and flourishing establishments where every sort of book is sold that you do not want to read where rows and rows of the classics you wish you could read again for the first time flaunt from the shelves in gaudy leather bindingsand a whole counter labours to support the newest and dullest novelsand another is covered with monographs which instruct you minutely as to how to grow fruit treescatch salmonhandle golf clubsor bicycle through the home countiesIt was in one of theseemporiums after the usualWe can get it for youMadam that I broke into open revolt and started off to The Poetry Bookshop I knew it was somewhere near the British Museum Off Theobald s Road I told the taxi driverand settled down to looking out of the windowfor Londonwhether on foot or drivingis a never ending interest to meTheobald s Road is one of those largebusy thoroughfareswhich cut across London in all directionsand off itto the left in my casewe turned into a quietrather run down little streetDevonshire StreetA swinging sign about half way down it attracted meIt was shaped like a shield and blueif I remember rightlyand on it were painted three torchesAll this was determined as the taxi approachedThat must be my placeI thoughtand it was We drew up at the door of a shop unmistakably a shopbecause it had a big shopwindowIt did not need the name The Poetry Bookshopin excellently designedbigblack letters over the windowto tell me that I had arrived I did not go in at onceI like to take my temptations graduallynibbling at them bit by bit and tastingbefore gulping them down as full fledged crimesI nibbled at that windowIt was broad and highand the books 20 The Little Reviewwere displayed in it in the singularly fascinating manner which American booksellers jeer at and callEnglish window dressing All these books were poetryor about poetry that isof courseall the ones that were not playsThere were long strips of ballads hanging downlike 18th century broadsideseach one topped by a crude woodcut in glaring redsand bluesand yellowsThe nibbling was so delightful that I collected quite a crowd of street urchins about mewondering what the lady was looking so long into the window forbefore I had done Then I went inbut even the window had not prepared me for the shop insideIt was a room rather than a shopfor there was a smart fire burning in the grateand there were chairsand settlesand a big table covered with the latest publicationsThe walls were lined with shelvesand under the window was a little ledge entirely filled with reviews from all over the worldThe familiar cover of Poetry made me feel quite at homebut the eclecticism of the proprietor was at once evidenced by the presence of The Poetry Journal and Poet Loreperiodicals of whose existence I should not have expected him to be awareThere was also The Poetry Reviewfrom which I knew he had severed himselfso it was obvious that the proprietor cared very much to be fair I turned to the shelvesand my surprise was even greaterThere were a lot of shelvesall round the room and even over the chimney breastEvery volume of poetry recently published was thereThat I had expectedbut what I had not expected was that all the classics were there tooNot bound into mausoleums handsome editions in handsome bindingswhich no gentleman s library should be without but readable volumesfor the reader who wants to read There was not a bit of glass in the shopall was open and touchableOf course I touchedand openedand browsedThere were French bookstooand ItalianIt goes without saying that the book I wanted was thereI know I bought itand othersand came out laden and happy I did not meet MrMonro on this first visitand I do not now remember exactly when I did meet himMy sojourns in the shop were manyand at this distance have become confusedBut I did meet him sometimeand found an earnestquiet gentlemanthe very opposite from the crankBut even at the first visit I had felt the bookshop to be notcrazyat allbut an answer to a very real needIt has been my experience that people who really do thingsin contradistinction to talking about themare very straightforwardsensible personswithout sentimentalism in the pursuit of their idealMrMonro was exactly thisHe was spending his energy to give poetry the dignity and charm of presentaton it had lost at the hands of the commercial booksellers he was encouraging poets and allowing their books a chancebut he did not talk idealsnor dress like a combination of a fool and a wild animalHe was too busy to posehe was juston the job And whaton the jobmeant and means is best told by giving the history of his enterpriseFor some years MrMonro had lived abroadin Switzerland and ItalyBut the nostalgia of home took possession of himand he returned to EnglandShortly after his arrival The Poetry Society asked him to edit a magazine for themand he consentedand The Poetry Review began in January1912MrMonro not only edited the Reviewbut paid for itNow the Poetry Societylike all such bodiesis conservativeand MrMonro is sown with the seeds of radicalismSo differences of policy beganand at the end of a yearMrMonro seceded from The Poetry Review and founded another reviewPoetry and Dramato be published quarterly But I am anticipatingWhile editing The Poetry Review MrMonro conceived the idea of having a bookshopwhich should be at once the office of the review and its various publicationsand a shopAn old house in Devonshire Street was leased and everythingen train when MrMonro found that the inevitable breach with The Poetry Society on matters of policy was imminentHe announced in The Poetry Review the foundation of a new magazinea quarterlyand relinquished The Poetry Review into other hands after having founded it and edited it for twelve months On January 8th1913The Poetry Bookshop opened its doors to the publicand the publicalways caught by noveltyflocked inProfessor Henry Newbolt gave the opening addressThe first publication of the BookshopGeorgian Poetsan anthology of the work of Lascelles AbercrombieRupert BrookeWHDaviesWalter de la MareJames Elroy FleckerWilfred Wilson GibsonDHLawrenceJohn MasefieldJames StephensHarold Monro himselfand othershad already appearedThis book has been extraordinarily successfulandin two yearshas gone through ten editions Of course the book helped the bookshopand the bookshop helped the bookSo delighted were the amusement hunters with the ideathat there was some danger of the venture being swamped in the tide of fashionBut MrMonro was too genuinely in earnest to be elated by his successor depressed when it calmed down to a normal interestThe bookshop pegged away at its work and in March1913the first number of Poetry and Drama appearedThis little quarterly is indispensable to anyone wishing to keep abreast with what is being done in poetry abroadThe articles on French poetry by FSFlint alone are worth the cost of subscriptionBut Poetry and Drama also publishes original poetrycritical reviewsand EnglishFrenchItalianand American chroniclesIt is an interesting paperand if I easily see how it could be betteredthat only means that I am an enthusiastic readerWas anyone ever sincerely devoted to a paper without feeling that with a grain of his advice it could still be improved Yet I have a sneaking feeling that MrMonro runs his paper better than I shouldbetter than any of us wouldIt requires a singularly unselfish and dispassionate devotion to run a paper and have it favor all schoolsand criticise all cliquesequallyNobody is quite pleased by that methodbut the public gets what it pays forand Ifor oneadmire a man with this qualityof justice in himPoetry and Drama ran until December of this yearwhen it was suspended during the continuance of the warand the lack of it is so noticeable that it shows very well what a position it had already achieved The Poetry Bookshop publishes as well as sellsGeorgian Poetry was followed by Anthologie des ImagistesPoems by John AlfordAnthology of Futurist Poetryand various small ventures such as The Rhyme Sheetthe broadsides I have spoken of before and a number of little chap books called Flying Fame Publicationsof which one I have seenEve by Ralph Hodgsonis enchanting Many though MrMonro s activities werethe house was too big for themSo MrMonro fitted up some of the attic rooms as bedroomsand there his clientele of poets hailing from the country find a welcome and inexpensive lodgingsOther rooms are used as reading roomsfor readings are held every Tuesday and Thursday at 6 PMSometimes the poets read their own poemssometimes other people read themVerhaeren and Marinetti have read there and many other poetswell known and still unknownMrMonro invites those he desiresand as he runs his readings as he runs his shop there is great and stimulating varietyThe difficulty with this sort of thing is the hangers onthe horde of the sentimental of both sexes who fasten upon an artistic endeavor and seriously hurt itIt is inevitable that some of these parasites should drift into the readingsas I noticed on one occasion that I was thereBut time will weed them outfor such people can never bear to realize that art is as hardworking assaystonecutting Since the war The Poetry Bookshop has been printing chap bookspublished at sixpenceAmong them are Maurice Hewlet s Singsongs of the WarAntwerp by Ford Maddox HuefferThe King s Highway by Henry NewboltThe Old Ships by James Elroy Fleckerand for unmartial reliefSpring Morning by Frances CornfordSongs by Edward ShanksThe Contemplative Quarry by Anna Wickhamand Children of Love by Harold Monro MrMonro is so stern in his idealism thatalthough a poet of originality and feelinghe willingly minimizes his own production for the sake of advancing poetryen masse That is remarkableand his enterprise deserves all the success which the poets and the general public can give it America1915JOHN GOULD FLETCHERthe

LANESOME months agoin these pagesMrWitter Bynner pointed out that Imagismwas derived from a Japanese poetical formthe name of which MrBynner regretted that he had forgottenThis name isHokku and undoubtedly the Japanese Hokku poetry was the model upon which much of the work in the first Imagist Anthology was formednotably the contributions of MrEzra PoundThere was Greek influencetooin that first collectionBut the whole volume showed a remarkable desire towards perfection and clarity of utteranceand a delicate perception of beauty There were few poetry lovers who did not taste its fineastringent flavourbut its qualities were at once its faultsIt was beautiful workbut too tenuous ever to become a great artsaid the objectorsIt was incapable of embracing many of the elements of life and poetryThe Imagists must remain side trackedand thereforeclever though they werethey could not be of real importanceBut it seems that Imagism was more virilemore capable of growththan was supposedThe jejune maledictions and assertions of their chief spokesmanMrPoundhave done so much to make the group ridiculous that it is with a feeling of surprise that we find this volume a great advance upon its predecessorHere is the work of six poetsfour of whom were represented in the first anthologyIn an interesting preface they state their poetical theorieswhich are much the same as those printed so often in PoetryBut here the tenets are soberly and sensibly presentedand the whole preface is dignified and worthy of considerationClearly the Imagists are growing upIt is hardly necessary to rehearse here the Imagist creedIt has been discussedwith more or less hostilityin many reviewsBut certainlyin reading this prefacethe hostility suddenly vanishesand the reviewer finds himself wondering if perhapsafter allthis movement is not one of most unusual significanceBrieflythese poets call themselves Imagists because their object is to present an image they believethat poetry should render particulars exactly and not deal in vague generalitieshowever magnificent and sonorousthy desireto use the language of common speech andto employ always the exact wordnot the nearly exactnor the merely decorative word They wishto produce poetry that is hard and clearnever blurred nor indefinite andfinallythey are convinced thatconcentration is of the very essence of poetryBrave wordsexcellent aims and hard enough of attainmentAgainthese poets agree to allow absolute freedom of subjectandwith a little dig at some of their contemporariesthey say It is not good art to write badly The Little Reviewabout aeroplanes and automobiles nor is it necessarily bad art to write well about the pastWe believe passionately in the artistic value of modern lifebut we wish to point out that there is nothing so uninspiring nor so old fashioned as an aeroplane of the year 1911That is a wholesome point of viewbut indeed the Imagists have hardly erred on the side of too great a preoccupation with modern lifeIn fact this volume is noteworthy as showing a more personala less literaryoutlook on lifeThe first Imagist Anthology contained the work of ten poetsSome were represented by a number of poemssome by only oneIn this new volume only four of those poets are representedBut what is remarkable is that they are not all the one poem authorsOn the contraryRichard Aldington and HDhad more poems in the first anthology than anyone else in the volumeyet here are Richard Aldington and HDsubscribing to an arrangement which gives each poet approximately the same amount of space Also says the preface to avoid any appearance of precedencetheythe poets includedhave been put in alphabetical order So art is to come before self advertisementHappy omen With such ideals the group should go farSix young poets with so much talentdevotionand singleness of purposeis a phenomenon to be noticedPerhaps this is the key to thedifferences of taste and judgmentwhich have divorced these poets from the others of the first anthologyThey go on to say thatgrowing tendencies are forcing them along different paths We can only guess at the tendenciesas the poems in this book show themand it is not our business to probe farther into a scism which is touched upon so lightly and quietly in this admirable prefaceThe six poets of this little anthology areRichard AldingtonHD John Gould FletcherFSFlintDHLawrenceand Amy LowellIt is quite easy to see whymutual artistic sympathybinds these young people togetherBut how extraordinarily individual they arejust the same From the exquisitegem like poems of HD to the organ music of Amy Lowell in The Bombardmentwith the gracefultenderoften humorous work of Richard Aldington and the tragic earnestness of DHLawrenceset off by the rich imagination of John Gould Fletcherand the poetic realismtouched with a charming intimatenessof FSFlint Richard Aldington s contributions begin with Childhooda study of a lonely little boy in a horribly dull English townIt is full of wistfulnessfor the little boy is very realand the detail is admirably managedThe little boy is shut up in the ugly townlike a chrysalis in a matchboxI hate that town There were always cloudssmokerain In that dingy little valleyIt rainedit always rainedI think I never saw the sun until I was nineAnd then it was too lateEverything s too late after the first seven years The Little Review 29That is very vividSotoois the description of the contents of the large tin box in the atticBut MrAldington never allows the descriptions to usurp the poem he keeps them properly subordinated to his themethe loneliness of the child Fine as this poem isit seems more experimental than MrAldington s shorter workLong poems require a different technique from short poemsand perhaps MrAldington has not yet become quite master of itIt is in the short poems that he is so eminently successful The Poplar is an almost perfect poem of its kindA completeimage and with that finepoetic imagination which is the hall mark of MrAldington s best workWhat could be more beautiful than thisI know that the white wind loves youIs always kissing you and turning up The white lining of your green petticoatThe sky darts through you like blue rainAnd the grey rain drips on your flanks And loves youAnd I have seen the moon Slip his silver penny into your pocket As you straightened your hairAnd the white mist curling and hesitating Like a bashful lover about your knees The Poplar ison the wholethe best poem of MrAldington s in the bookbut The Faun Sees Snow for the First Time runs it closeAnd here we have that divine gift of poetical humor which is another of MrAldington s rare qualitiesSpace alone prevents me from quoting itBut if I put these two firstwhere shall I put Round Pondwith its sunshining upon the water like a scattering of gold crocus petalsMrAldington has advanced in his artIn spite of the Faun and Lemureshe has sloughed off much of the Greek mannerism which marred his work in the first anthologyThe training which his Greek studies have given himis here put to excellent and individual useOne looks for much from him in the future HDs poems are undoubtedly the most perfect in the bookThere is nothing broadnothing varied about her attemptsbut what she tries for she succeeds in doingabsolutelyBut in her worktoowe find a grateful change going onThe stage properties are no longer exclusively GreekIn factonly one poem of her seven has anything obviously Greek about itThere is nothing specifically inartistic in this transplanting of the imagery of another place and time into one s workBut when an English poet fills every poem full of Greek names and Greek devicesthe result is intense weariness on the part of the readerThe poems may be beautifulbut this foreign flavour gives them a sort of chilling qualityOne cannot help feeling that the poet is straining after a poetical effectand that stands in the way of a complete sympathy between poet and reader 30 The Little ReviewHDis too much of an artist not to have realized thisand in these new poemswith the exception I have mentioned there is no hint of direct preoccupation with the Greek in title or textYet the poems are so completely Greek that they might be translations from some newly discovered papyrusAnd stillin reading themone feels that the sincerity of the artist is not to be questionedHere is no striving after effectbut a complete saturation of a personality in a past modeIf one believed in reincarnationsone could sayand be certainthat HDwas the reincarnation of some dead Greek singerThe Greek habit sits upon her as easily as a dressloosened by constant wearIt is undubitably hersTo adopt another speech would be an unpardonable artificialityRealizing thisand not making the mistake that so many reviewers have done in considering her a copyistwe must admit that HDs poems attain a perfection which is not to be found in the work of any other modern poetThis garland of sea flowers is a masterpiece of pure beautyI have only space to quote one of these poemsbut it shall be quoted entire Sea IrisWeedmoss weedroot tangled in sand sea irisbrittle flower one petal like a shellis broken and you print a shadowlike a thin twig Fortunate onescented and stingingrigid myrrh budcamphor flowersweet and salt you are wind in our nostrils II Do the murex fishers you as they passyour roots drag up colour the sandthey slipped gold under you of goldBand of iris flowers the wavesare painted bluelike a fresh prow among the salt weedsHDhas her limitationsas I said beforeThey are the most obvious thing about herexcept her perfectionBut it is so ridiculous to cavil at themas it would be to deny the loveliness of one of the sea flowers she writes aboutbecause it is not a forest of lofty trees To pass from HDto MrJohn Gould Fletcher is something in the nature of a shockIt is a good deal like plunging into the ocean from a warmsunny cliffOne s earsand noseand mouthare filled with rushing waterOne feels in the grasp of an overwhelming powerand one struggles to the surfacebreathlesshalf drownedbut wholly invigoratedTo drop the figurethese two poems of MrFletcher s are so full of potentialitiesso large in suggestionthat one hardly knows what to say about themDoes The Blue Symphony mean lifeI confess I do not knowIs it merely a series of picturesNothere is a vague undercurrent to the poem which makes that impossibleIt is the sort of poem which a mystic might ponder over indefinitely and find new meanings every hourAnd yet it is all done with the precision and clearness of the Imagist theory It is impossible to give any idea of the poem as a whole by quoting bits of itBut little pieceseven divorced from their contexthave that succinct epigrammatic quality which is the stamp of geniusHere are three linesI have heard and have seenAll the news that has beenAutumn s gold and Spring s greenIt is evident in this poem that MrFletcher has been much influenced by the Japanese And now the lowest pine branch Is drawn across the disk of the sun is absolutely JapaneseBut strangely enough it is a technique got from astudy of Japanese painting rather than from Japanese poetryMrFletcher s versatility is shown by turning from The Blue Symphonyto his other poemLondon ExcursionHere the note of mysticism of The Blue Symphony is entirely abandonedand there is no hint of Japanese influenceIf London Excursion follows any leadit is the lead of the new schools of poetry and painting in FranceBut I will not insult MrFletcher by suggesting that he isin any waya disciple of Marinetti and the FuturistsIt is nearer the truth to say that he has realized the vividness of some of their methodsand modified them to his own use London Excursion is one of the most interesting poems in this volumeIt is a poem of a man going into London in the morning bybusspending the day walking about the streets and going into shopsand coming home at night by trainIt sounds simplebut it is really the most amazing expression of lightcolorand unrelated impressions that one can conceiveThis is his impression of a street from hisbus topBlack shapes bending Taxicabs crush in the crowd The tops are each a shining square Shuttles that steadily press through wooly fabricThe Little ReviewDrooping blossomGas standards over Spray out jingling tumult Of white hot rays Monotonous domes of bowler hats Vibrate in the heatSilentlyeasily we sway through braying trafficDown the crowded streetThe tumult crouches over usOr suddenly drifts to one side MrFlint s work is always delightfulHe has a winning way of taking his reader into his confidenceThisand his love of naturewhich he paints with real affectiongains our sympathy at onceIt must be admitted that none of MrFlint s seven poems quite equal two of his in the first anthologyLondon My Beautiful and The SwanOne feels in these two poems a groping qualityas though the poet were not quite satisfied with them himselfAs though the first élan with which he adopted the vers libre medium were passing awayand he were beginning to realize that the form has its limitations If there is any truth in thisit is evidenthoweverthat MrFlint has not yet made up his mind to try anything elseIt would be almost a pity if he didfor few vers librists understand the manipulation of cadence as he doesPerhaps the following is the one of these poems which has most of his characteristic charm LunchFrail beautygold and incandescent whitenessdaffodilshave brought me Spring and longingyour irradianceThereforeI sit here the peoplemy heart aches all the hawthorn blossombees humminglight wind upon the poplarsyour warmth and your love your eyes smile and know meMalady strikes a stronger note than anything of MrFlint s that I have read beforeIt is excellent psychologyand steadilyastringently doneIt is this constant change and growth which makes the progress of this little group so interesting to watchMrFlint s work in the first anthologyseemed quite successful and finishedHe had done what he had done excellentlyand he would go on doing it to the end of the chapterBut here we see MrFlintdissatisfied with mere successdaring a wider horizonFrom the point of view of adequacy of techniquehis poems sufferas is natural but the technique is sure to follow the widened thoughtbefore longMalady and the poem called Fragment show the direction in which MrFlint is movingHis next work will be interesting to see MrDHLawrence is the best known of the poets in this bookalthough a newcomer to the anthologyNo modern writer is more vigorous than heand none is more entirelyalmost brutally sincereIn MrLawrence s novels this brutality is sometimes excessively evidentbut always one feels that the author inflicts pain upon himself as well as his readers that he says what he sees and is concerned not to shirk and be a coward for his own comfort In his poetryMrLawrence seems to be more lenient with himselfIt is as though he allowed the moralist in him a day outNot that he ever ceases to be a moralistreallyBut he permits himself to lay a slight covering over the stark nakedness of disagreeable factsThis covering is poetryand very beautiful and original poetry it is GreenThe sky was apple greenThe sky was green wine held up in the sun The moon was a golden petal between She opened her eyesand greenThey showclear like flowers undone For the first timenow for the first time seen MrLawrence has solved the problem of vers libre for himselfby writing in a rhymed metre which usually defies all scansionbut which gives a queerand most satisfactory effectof elasticity and strengthFor this reasonand for its noveltyMrLawrence s manner is very interestingbut his matter is still more soRead The Mowersa common tragedybut put so newly and strikingly that it comes upon one with all its original force Fireflies in the Corn and A Woman to Her Dead Husband are new in subject as well as in presentationand they have a bald reality about them which I have never met in any other poemBut never once does MrLawrence make the mistake of being only a realist he never ceases to be a poetIn Fireflies in the Corn there are these lines And those bright fireflies wafting in between And over the swaying cornstalksjust above And all their dark feathered helmetslike little green Starscome low and wandering here for love Of this dark earth The Ballad of Another Ophelia is probably his best poemIn it we see his peculiar style at its very best34 The Little ReviewMrLawrence is the singer of truththe lover of humanityHis inclusion into the Imagist group shows that the school is broad and real enough not to desire to shut itself up in the cupboard of precocityas in the beginning there was some fear of its doing Where MrLawrence gives us the broadest view of Imagism from an English standpoint that this newermore vital group has offered usMiss Lowell does the same service for the American sideThe qualities that make her work noteworthy are firsta virtuoso command of language that fits itself to the most diverse themesand seconda sort of fantasticcurious irony that is essentially AmericanThis irony is perhaps at its finest in The Traveling Bear and The Letterbut these are too long to quoteI choose instead Bullionwhich may be taken for a very modern type of love poemin which love itself becomes a burdenMy thoughts Chink against my ribs And roll about like silver hail stonesI should like to spill them outAnd pour themall shiningOver youBut my heart is shut upon them And holds them straitly ComeYou and open my heart That my thoughts torment me no longerBut glitter in your hair Miss Lowell always looks at things from an angleHer mind reflects the unusual aspect and that most vividlyAs she says of herselfWhen night drifts along the streets of the cityAnd sifts down between the uneven roofsMy mind begins to peek and peerIt plays at ball in oldblue Chinese gardensAnd shakes wrought dice cups in Pagan templesAmid the broken flutings of white pillarsIt dances with purple and yellow crocuses in its hairAnd its feet shine as they flutter over drenched grassesHow light and laughing my mind isWhen all the good folk have put out their bed room candlesAnd the city is stillMiss Lowell has the ability which is rare among present day poets of recognizing that beauty does not belong to an epoch or a periodbut is always the sameunder whatever strange form it may present itself Doubtless her most remarkable poem is that called The BombardmentWhether the technique adopted here by Miss Lowell is destined to work a revolution in verse writing remains for the future to settleBut hereat leastit perfectly justifies itselfNo one should permithowevera question of technique to obscure the deep tragedythe splendid humanityof this poem The Little Review 35War has only one beautythat of its terrible destructiveness of all beautyThe Bombardment is the best statement of this aspect of war I knowIt must be read in its entiretyand so I will not attempt piecemeal quotation of this most fitting conclusion to the volume This book is so provocative of thoughtthe poets in it are so suggestiveeach one by him or herselfthat each really requires a separate reviewBut I have said enough to show what an important volume this little book isWe are told that it is to be an annualand certainly we shall watch its succeeding appearances with great interest It is certainly best to separate an artist so far from his work as not to take him as seriously as his workNietzsche36 The Little ReviewEditorials and AnnouncementsThe Murder of a PoetIT is reported that Rupert Brooke died of sun stroke last month in the DardanellesThere is nothing to be said in the face of such monster horrors And it is also reported that Sir Johnston Forbes Robertson has burned up his production of Shaw s Caesar and Cleopatranot being able to bear the strain of acting in a play written by his unpatriotic countryman who protested against such horrors Emma Goldman s Lectures in May a recent meeting of the Chicago Woman s Clubwhen all the editors of Chicago magazines explained the virtues of their respective journalsLucien Cary saidpolitely but in effectthat TH E LITTLE REVIEW was no good The only striking thing it has donebeside coming out at allis to discover Emma Goldmana nice woman with views less radical than Emerson s and certainly far less well expressed I quote this because it is so exhilarating to catch MrCary in a half truth the kind of thing that makes for the confused thinking he is so valiantly in arms againstIf TH E LITTLE REVIEW had been alive about twenty five years ago I hope we would have had the sense to discover that a great woman was beginning to work in this countryAs it iswe could only try to point out how difficult and how fine has been Emma Goldman s living of the things Emerson thought it would be good to liveIt was not for the people who know their Emerson that we tried itbut for those who have forgotten himlike MrCary Since we failed so miserably we shall have to try againBut in the meantime you may hear Emma Goldman herself and discover just how she is helping to make Emerson s essays livableShe is to lecture for a week in Chicagoin the most delightful lecture room in the city the Assembly

office lately is a small journal with the wordDionysionon its coverIt is the first volume of a magazine for the futherance of Isadora Duncan s work in Americaand the committee that has helped make this rather amazing thing possible includes such names as John WAlexanderPercy MacKayeTheodore DreiserWill Levington ComfortMax EastmanRobert HenriEdith Wynne MathisonJulia CulpWitter BynnerJohn DrewWalter Damroschand many othersOn the first page is Whitmanthen Nietzsche on Dionysian Artand then Robert Henri with a little article on the new education in which he saysI was tremendously impressed one day in Isador Duncan s studioby the look in the faces of the childrenAs they passed by me in the dance I saw great dignitybalanceeaseI was impressedtoothroughout the entire time by the fact that they seemed absolutely secure in their happinessThey appeared to know unconsciously that they would receive a full measure of praise and that in no case would there be blame or punishmentIn each little upturned face was a rare look of freedomthe look of people on a higher plane of self consciousnessan aloofness from the common thoughtI saw in their expression the impress of the measures of great music And he goes on thattoinspire courage in childrento stimulate them with the work of those who have the courage to createto make of them frank facers of the emotional problems of lifeto start them on the way toward a great constructive lifewe must take care not to impose our wisdom and our ignorance on thembut to give them the benefit of the best we have through a frank response to their natural interrogation Isadora Duncan s idea is thatthe expression of the modern school of ballet wherein each action is an endand no movementposeor rhythm is successive or can be made to evolve succeeding actionis an expression of degenerationof living deathAll the movements of our modern ballet school are sterile movements because they are unnatural their purpose is to create the delusion that the law of gravitation does not exist for them I know a man from Russia who came to this country knowing only two words of EnglishIsadora Duncan He had seen Miss Duncan dance once in StPetersburg and from that moment he looked forward to America as the country ofhighest intelligences in the freest bodies We may sometime become worthy of this remarkable womanDionysion ought to help Isaac Loeb

volume of his Talesissued by the Jewish Publication SocietyHis poetrywritten in Hebrew and in Yiddishmay be compared to that of Heine in its gracefulnessbut it bears in addition the melancholy of

not gone over to till strange fieldsricher and more remunerativeThe Jewish stage in America flourishes on Gordin s melodramas and on cheap farces the theatrical managers are too business like to produce such a high play as Peretz s Golden Chain The StPatrick s AffairGOLDMAN sent me this letter about the two Italian boysAbarno and Carbonewho have been found guilty of trying to blow up StPatrick s CathedralOur efforts for the Italian victims were in vainThey were found guiltyalthough every bit of evidence brought out how the provocateur inducedurged the actbought the materialmade

the recent translation of Fyodor Dostoevsky s book which is called The House of the DeadI have suffered from a distressing ambitionI would like to go to Russia and there commit some naive atrocity and be sent to a Siberian prison for at least ten yearsI have an unpatriotic prejudice and a lack of illusion concerning American criminals or I would commit my atrocity on American soilTheyAmerican criminalsare as a rule a petty lot given to sentimental regrets and griefs and reforms and periodicalsThere is nothing which reflects the smugness of a people so much as the manner and temperament of its viceAnd the temperament of American vice is more distinctly and monotonously bourgeois than any of its virtuesThe American citizen even when about to be hanged is unable to rise above the commonplace reactionsimaginedfor his predicament by such authors as belong to the Indiana Society I have hunted the American criminal with the policebeen present at his confessionwatched him at his trialsat with him in his death cell and listened to him recite psalms and sermonize as the nervous sheriff adjusted the noose around his neckHe is an artificial and uninteresting disappointmentIt

in insatiable perversion and dripping with infamyThe arrogantsadistic artists of torturehuman as childrenwith their pitifully crippled souls praying before the prison ikonsstealing their comrade s

as DostoevskyWas Dostoevsky dreaming of a new religion when he filled the pages with his human crucifixionsProbably notBut his artistry and his painstakingsearching minute psychology have illumined The House of the Dead so that for him who is not afraid it is as holy and human a source of inspiration as the loving sacrifices of the Nazarene Thaumaturgist And yet it is a simple bookThere are very few writings so direct and simpleso easy to read and to understandThe terrifying lusts and passions and distorted rages make the mind quiverbut they never mystifyThe harrowing morbidities pierce the intelligence like hot lancesbut they never blunt or deprave the moral sensesThe fierce pathos so exquisitely writtenthe blood soaked restraintsthe consumptive dying in his iron fetters too weak to support the weight of the little cross on his chestthe wildinhuman humaness they sizzle away the nerve cuticles and burn the emotions with a strange fire It is the peculiar paradox of reactionI visited once a Home for Crippled Children and came away happier and cleanerThere the little misshapen bodies and the unconscious holiness of their suffering suddenly revealed to me things I had scoffingly overlooked in the popular words of accepted divinesAnd it is the same way with the company that writhes through the pages of Dostoevsky s bookA more material illustration of this paradox is the very rhapsodies I have indulged in to convey what I have readThere are no rhapsodies in the bookThere is nodramatic actionat all in the bookIt is the most inactive book I ever have readbarring not certain memoirs and diariesNothing happens in the bookyet from its start a demoralized pageant marches thunderingly across the pagesand somehowby a psychological process it would take Dostoevsky again to reveallifts the spirit to heights as lofty as its itinerary is lowAs for the style of its writingthere are no secrets in the art for the great RussianAnd here he chooses the grimgripping reiterationthe tragic calm and human poesy of simple words to build up his staggering effects What will Americans think of the book providing it becomes popularand it may The idolatrous regard born in this country for Russian art instances the possibilities of American hysteria directed in the proper channels The great majority of themhowever particularly those with whom I have mentioned my horror of spending ten years will feel it incumbent upon them to be outragednone more so than the criminal fraternityIt is perhaps stretching a point to say that even so were the highly and lowly estimable backbones of an earlier period of less comparative moribund piety outraged by the Sermon on the MountBut there is a promising liklihood that their ectypes will never read the volume and will thus be saved or lost or whatever you willAnd those who see the light from this Sermon in the Depths can effect an exclusiveness which will merit them the flattering curses and derisions of their fellow men for many sweet years to come The translation is by Constance Garnett and is excellently doneMrsGarnettmore than any linguisthas in her work conveyed the atmosphere and idiom and temperament of the Russian into EnglishShe is responsible for the remarkable translations of Turgeniev which have carried his art unchanged into another tongueas well as for the Dostoevsky novelsFor the benefit of readers who will be puzzled by her footnote on page 11theGreen Streetwhich she is unable to define is the avenue formed between two ranks of prison soldiers through which the condemned convict is

AnthologyCARL SANDBURGThe Spoon River Anthologyby Edgar Lee Masters The Macmillan CompanyNew York I saw Masters write this bookHe wrote it in snatched moments between fighting injunctions against a waitressesunion striving for the right to picket and gain one day s rest a weekbattling from court to court for compensation to a railroad engineer rendered a loathsome cripple by the defective machinery of a locomotivehaving his life amid affairs as intense as those he writes of At The Book and Play Club one night Masters tried to tell how he came to write the AnthologyOf coursehe couldn t tellThere are no writers of great books able to tell the how and why of a dominating spirit that seizes them and wrenches the flashing pages from themBut there are a few forces known that play a partAnd among these Masters said he wanted emphasis placed on Poetryvoices callingUnhand me verses and lines from all manner and schools of writers welcomed in Harriet Monroe s magazine Once in a while a man comes along who writes a book that has his own heart beats in itThe people whose faces look out from the pages of the book are the people of life itselfeach trait of them as plain or as mysterious as in the old home valley where the writer came fromSuch a writer and book are realized here Mastershome town is LewistonIllinoison the banks of the Spoon RiverThere actually is such a river where Masters waded bare foot as a boyand where the dead and the living folk of his book have fished or swamor thrown pebbles and watched the widening circlesIt is not farless than a few hoursdrivefrom where Abraham Lincoln was raisedPeople who knew Lincoln are living there today Wellsome two hundred and twenty portraits in free verse have been etched by Masters from this valleyThey are Illinois peopleAlso they are the people of anywhere and everywhere in so called civilization Aner Clute is the immortal girl of the streetsChase Henry is the town drunkard of all timeThe railroad lawyerthe corrupt judgethe prohibitionistthe various adulterers and adulteressesthe Sunday School superintendentthe mothers and fathers who lived for sacrifice in gratitudejoyall these people look out from this book with haunting eyesand there are baffled mouths and brows calm in the facing of their destinies When a few of the pieces in this book reached Ezra Poundthe judgment he passed upon them was that they are real and great poetry from the hand of a new and a genuine American poetIt was Alice Corbin Henderson who was the first American critic to seize upon some of these poems as they were running in The StLouis Mirrorand put them forward in Poetry as strikingindigenousout of the soil of America as a home landWilliam Marion Reedyeditor of The StLouis Mirroris accredited by Masters for the keen enthusiasm with which he helped him carry along the work of writing In the year 1914 Masters not only handled all of his regular law practiceheavy and grillingBesideshe wrote The Spoon River AnthologyThere were times when he was clean fagged with the day s workBut a spell was on him to throw into written form a picture gallerya series of short movies of individuals he had seen back homeEach page in the anthology is a locked up portrait now freed The stress of this bore down on MastersJust before the proof sheets for his book came to his handshe went down with fever and pneumonia and a complex of physical illsIt was the first time in his life he was willing to admit he wassick abedThere is vitalitydrops of heart bloodpoured into Lee MastersbookHe has other books in him as vivid and poignantLet us hope luck holds him by the hand and takes him along where he can write out these other ones Poetry and the Panama Pacific EUNICE TIETJENSpoetryas an artany meaning whatever for the American peopleor has all the recent ink which has been spilled in proclaiming a renascence of American poetry gone only to water the roots of the publishing business These are questions which will be forced upon the mind of every admirer of the lyric muse in contemplating the Panama Pacific International Exposition in San FranciscoFor in spite of the millions of money and the acres of ground at the disposal of the American sections there is nowhereexcept in the commercial exhibits of the publishersany recognition of the existence of contemporary poetry When taxed with the fact that the art is unrepresented the heads of the departments point deprecatingly to the fact that as a decorative feature of certain architectural archways poetical quotations are usedThere is a quotation from Confusiusone from the Kalisadaseveral from Edmund Spencerand oneO Triumph of Modernity from Walt WhitmanAs no commercial exhibit is accepted which was in existence at the time of the StLouis Exposition this answer is doubly enlightening All the other arts are hereArchitecturemusicsculpturemural and easel paintingdrawingprints and etchinglandscape gardeningtogether with the so calledLiberal Artsare adequately representedBut not poetryA perusal of theP sof the official list in an attempt to discover it is significant Poultryis there with a large exhibitso isPlumbagoPlumbersImplementsPomologyandPonies Excellent exhibits allbut hardly lyrical It may be urgedof coursethat other artssuch as the arts of the theatreacting and stagecraftand the literary art of prose writingare also omittedBut although exhibitions of these things would be eminently desirable they present great practical difficultiesAnd these arts haveafter alla commercial side which is more or less adequately suggestedBut with poetry the case is differentThe mere fact that commercially poetry islike Perlmutter s automobilea liability and not an assetought in our practical age to prove that it is afine art And the practical difficulty of providing a set of bookshelves and a competent jury to pass on admissions need hardly stagger the directors of so colossal an undertakingAdd to this dailyor even bi weeklyreadings of contemporary poetry and the result would be a representation in proportion to the attention paid the other arts It would be useless to urge that this Exposition is a privateor even a local enterpriseIt cannot stand as suchIt represents in the face of the warring world the development of our countryculturally as well as commerciallyAnd the fact that one of the oldest and most reverenced of the arts is totally unrepresented must inevitably redound to the discredit of the executive officersand through them of the people at large For the root of this cavalier treatment of poetry isafter allin the American peopleAs a nationin spite of our complacency in the present world crisiswe are still in the stage of culture in which we believe that man can live by bread aloneAnd we can scarcely hope for more adequate recognition of the art until those of us to whom poetry is a living factand not an academic perceptionhave battled at greater length and with greater self sacrifice in the eternal struggle through commercialism to beauty The Mob GodThe seats creak expectantlyThe white whirr of the movie machine takeson a special significanceIn the

THE SCAVANGER The Theatre ROSMERSHOLMThe Chicago Little TheatreIthe DON T want to write about Rosmersholm or about Ibto write about MineBorgny Hammerwho is great great NorwegiansThere is a lot of talk about the Russian soul just atsen nowin the ma presentI want nner ofI wishthe Norwegian soul might come in for its share of analysis and appreciationIt is interesting not because of its dark shudderings but because of its intense light and its clearnessIt is like the sunit is like wild flowers not the delicate but the hardy ones MmeHammer is this sort of personShe is an actress because she must act or dieShe is so intense that the air about her is alwayscharged and she is so natural and simple that you know right away she must be greatThere wasn t a particle of difference between her presence on the stage as the Ibsen heroine and her manner when she meets you on Michigan Avenue and stops to say that Ibsen is so wonderful it s impossible to cut a line ofThe Little Review 47his dialogueIn both situations she is the geniusMrsFiske s Rebecca West was a stunningly worked out idea MmeHammer s was just Rebecca WestMrsFiske had a theory of the character and presented it in a series of subtle and powerful designsBut what did this wonderful woman doShe didn t act Rebecca West at allshe just gave you the impression that she is Rebecca every day of her lifeShe made Rosmersholm a natural scene in the life of some modern familyinstead of making it astudyan effect in a rather strained psychology I wish I could describe MmeHammer s stage conversations especially the parts where she listensShe is so busy feeling Rebecca West that she has no time to waste in managing her eyes and voice and handsThey take care of themselves just as they would in her own libraryWhen our best actresseslistenthey keep their eyes on the person who is talking with the kind of look that saysI know it would be bad art now to look at the audience out of the tail of my eyeI must pay close attention to what this actor is saying to me MmeHammer looks at Rosmer with the same expression she would wear if he were about to say things she hadn t heard him rehearse every day for six weeksIf she should break out with some dialogue of her own it couldn t sound any more spontaneous than her reading of the lines Ibsen gave to RebeccaI know Rebecca s linesand yet I forgot them and decided she must be making things up as she went alongWhat richness of simplicityand what a sturdy beautyI have never seen an actress who cares less about herself than MmeHammer and cares so deeply for the character she is presentingThe expressions of her face are marvelousShe said to me once that she disagreed with critics who thought Hedda Gabbler had nothing to give She had so muchso very much to give she said passionatelyNo wonder she thinks so she is a big woman who herself has an infinity of things to giveMCATHE TROJAN WOMEN Of the production of The Trojan Women of Euripides by The

providentially have been created a genuine offering to the vigilant keepers of BeautyHERMAN SCHUCHERT Two CHICAGO PIANISTSI have not heard all the young Chicago musicians playbut of those I have heard there are two who stand out as musicians and pianists instead of merely good players of the pianoThey are Carol Robinson and James Whittaker Miss Robinson is an Illinois girl who came to Chicago to be Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler sartist pupil or something like thatand chief assistantA year ago she was playing the piano efficiently this year she is using that as a starting point and proving that she has a real right to the instrumentShe has a technical foundation that cannot fail herit is already equal to practically all the tests she may need to put it toand she uses it as surely and unconsciously as one uses his feet to walk withHer playing at present has the clearness and innocence of a brookif she can get something of the sea into her feeling she will be bigThe music Carol Robinson gives is not so far the expression of some incredible longing to make the piano serve as an outletIt is natural and beautiful and absolutely untroubledIt is articulate and yet it has not acquired a meaningIt is without a hint of intensityCarol Robinson has the most interesting part of the struggle before her the part for which her genius for hard work is merely a preparationwhat does she want to say through the piano James Whittaker s music is very personalvery sensitivevery charmingand very marked by good tasteIt is by far the most musical playing I have heard in ChicagoMrWhittaker went to Berlin to study and then to Pariswhere he finished and became an ardent exponent of the French schoolHis technical equipment is not the perfect tool that Carol Robinson s is by which I don t mean that it is at all inadequatebut somehow you feel that he is always conscious of the demands he puts upon it and that it sometimes leaves him unsatisfiedHis theory is that most of the methods taught outside the French Conservatoire areshort cuts but his work suggests that he succeeds in spite of his theoryFor he does succeed in the one great essential in making musicHis relation to the piano is a dedicationand his music is vibrant with feelingHis tone production is a pressure with a fine nervousness in itand he has the realpearlquality in his scalesHis Chopin is perhapsas he himself saysa littlescientific His César Franck just misses being deep enoughHe is at his best in quite modern French musicor in a thing like Grieg s Cradle Song which he plays veryvery beautifullyBrahms he doesn t want to playI imagine but the breadth that Brahms requires and gives is the very quality that would make what James Whittaker has to sayand is saying very charminglya bigger and deeper thing MCA WITH KREISLERFour weeks in the Trenchesby Fritz Kreisler Houghton CompanyBoston I had a big day with Ruby Davisour Chicago little violinistout in the countryroamingclimbingracingconversingbut not talkingTalk we left behind usin the city drawing roomsBetween pranks and escapades we found rest in sitting side by side and reading Kreisler s war impressionsI knew that Ruby worshipped Fritzbut his reflections on the book of the violinist have shown me that in addition to admiration he possesses critical perceptionW e delighted in the pages written with spontaneous beautywithout posewithout the banal superstructure of sentimental colorsbut revealing a tensevibratingvirile artistic heartreservedly sensitive to bloody horrors as well as to imperceptible impressions of human emotions concealed beneath the dehumanizing military uniformRuby called my attention to the fact that only such an artist as Kreisler could have had a broad non professional outlook on men and thingsan artist of unusual versatilityof a wide educationof rich experiences in various fields of lifeYethe addedonly the keendelicate ear of a musician could have perceived the symphonic sounds on the battle field and in the trenchesasfor instancein this passage My earaccustomed to differentiate sounds of all kindshad some time agowhile we were still advancingnoted a remarkable discrepancy in the peculiar whine produced by the different shells in their rapid flight through the air as they passed over our headssome sounding shrillwith a rising tendencyand the other rather dullwith a falling cadenceA short observation revealed the fact that the passing of a dull sounding shell was invariably preceded by a flash from one of our own cannon in the rear on the hillwhich conclusively proved it to be an Austrian shellIt must be understood that as we were advancing between the positions of the Austrian and Russian artilleryboth kinds of shells were passing over our headsAs we advanced the difference between shrill and dull shell grew less and less perceptibleuntil I could hardly tell them apartUpon nearing the hill the difference increased again more and more until on the hill itself it was very markedAfter our trench was finished I crawled to the top of the hill until I could make out the flash of the Russian guns on the opposite heights and by timing flash and actual passing of the shellfound to my astonishment that now the Russian missiles had become dullwhile on the other handthe shrill sound was invariably heralded by a flash from one of our gunsnow far in the rearWhat had happened was this Every shell describes in its course a parabolic linewith the first half of the curve being ascending and the second one descendingApparently in the first half of its curvethat isits course while ascendingthe shell produced a dull whine accompanied by a falling cadencewhich changes to a rising shrill as soon as the acme has been reached and the curve points downward againThe acme for both kinds of shells naturally was exactly the half distance between the Austrian and Russian artillery and this was the point where I had noticed that the difference was the least markedA few days laterin talking overThe Little Reviewmy observation with an artillery officerI was told the fact was known that the shells sounded different going up than when going downbut this knowledge was not used for practical purposesWhen I told him that I could actually determine by the sound the exact place where a shell coming from the opposing batteries was reaching its acmehe thought that this would be of great value in a case where the position of the opposing batteries was hidden and thus could be locatedHe apparently spoke to his commander about mefor a few days later I was sent on a reconnoitering tourwith the object of marking on the map the exact spot where I thought the hostile shells were reaching their acmeand it was later on reported to me that I had succeeded in giving to our batteries the almost exact range of the Russian gunsI have gone into the matter at some lengthbecause it is the only instance where my musical ear was of value during my service Ruby kept on explaining Kreisler while we were making our way through picturesque ravinesThen we stormed a steep bluff that made a difficult climband I had to pull and push my gentle co adventurer Be bravelittle KreislerHe turned to me with serious eyesand proceeded to point out the greatness of his godwho throughout the book does not even once show any national narrowness or hatred for the enemywho speaks with equal sympathy of the Russians and of the Austrianswho relates his terrible experiences in the swampy trenches in such a calmmodest tonemaking your heart bleed with sorrow for the hardships and suffering of the belligerentsWhat a terrible calamity it would have been had the Cossack slashed Kreisler s hand instead of his leg Ruby smiled with joy reading the last page in which the violinist regrets that he had been pronouncedinvalid and physically unfit for armed dutyand hadto discard his well beloved uniform for the nondescript garb of the civilian Ruby does not share his big brother s regretKThe Little ReviewBook DiscussionQUASI RATIONALISTIC MORALIZINGCriticisms of Lifeby Horace Bridges Houghton CompanyBoston Some time agoat a meeting of the Book and Play ClubMrBridges complained against TH E LITTLE REVIEW wherein a certain book was criticised and labelednaive and dull as the sermon of an Ethical Society preacherLadies and gentlemenI am naive and dull protested MrBridgesThe reviewer of that unfortunate bookwho happened to be presentexpressed his surprise at the complainer s unmodest assumption that those epithets were meant for himas if he had monopolized the characteristic features of all ethical preachersNow that MrBridgesbook is outthe reviewer wishes to make amends and apologize verilythe distinguished preacher was justified in claiming the honorary titles The author analyzes his problems through the prism of empirico pragmatic rationalismif such a combination is thinkableWhether it be Chesterton s theological viewsor Ellen Key s marriage theoryor Maeterlinck s mysticismor Sir Lodge s ideas on immortality the author applies to them the same apparatus for testing their validity and truthAre they provableAre they workableAre they in harmony with MrBridges s ethical standardA few citations will illustrate the critic s method and sense of humor He takes Gilbert Chesterton very seriouslyand indignantly reproves him for such typically Chestertonian offences as misquoting his opponentsas paradoxical buffooneries unpardonable tricksandinexcusable mistakeshe offers him a few lessons in theologyexplains to him in an earnest tone the meaning of miraclesthe Fall of Manand finally comes to the astounding discovery that the readerswill see in MrChesterton s amateur apologetics nothing but a psychological curiosityto be readlike his novelsfor amusementin some slight degree perhaps for edificationbut not at all for instruction Horrible dictuMrBridges s heaviest cannon are directed against Ellen KeyHe totally destroys her and Shaw s opposition to marriage with one humorous strokearguing that if that institution were really bad it would either have destroyed humanityor the revolted conscience of mankind would haverisen and annihilated the abominable thing This optimistic argument needs as little comment as the author s logical conclusion thatfree loveis equivalent to prostitution and that free divorce is synonymous with adulteryor as these pearlsI am decidedly of opinion that in a more enlightened age divorce will be as completely obsolete as duelling is to day in England I am opposed to divorce on this groundincompatibility of temperfor two reasons firstbecause if people s tempers are really so incompatible as to make their lifelong companionship intolerablethey canand therefore ought toknow this in time to prevent their unionAndsecondlybecause such incompatibility as can remain entirely concealed before marriage cannot possibly be so great but that it may be overcome and harmonized after marriage by means of proper self discipline and true grasp of the idea of duty No soldier would be pardoned for deserting from the army on the ground that he found his temper hopelessly incompatible with that of his comrades and his officersNo party to a business contract would be absolved from observing its terms upon any such consideration The right to renounce marriage because of unhappiness would logically involve the right to commit suicide for the same reason Who are we that we should repudiate the universe because it will not devote itself to securing our petty pleasures and happinessesMarriagelike every other great social ordinanceis instituted not primarily to secure our happinessbut to enable us to discharge our dutyin the matter of the perpetuation and spiritual development of the human species I am confident that the reader will appreciate the reviewer s gallantry in not taking issue with the quoted statements it would be too easy a task to exercise one s humor over such threadbare nicetiesMy only apology for devoting so much space to MrBridges s book is the fact that MrBridges is one of the moulders of public opinion in ChicagohenceI shall owe one more apology for my unrestrainable desire to quote the closing lines of the author s sermon on the WarMay shethis countrypreserve her unityand that nobly disinterested foreign policy manifestedto the admiration of all Europeindeedin Cuba and Mexicoso thatwhen the vials of apocalytic wrath beyond the seas are spentshe may enter to motion peace the welcome arbitress of Europe s dissensionsthe trusted daughterfirst of Englandbut in lesser degree of all the nations now at strifecalled in to cover their shame and to mediate the purgation of their sins Hm but I promised to refrain from commentsK SOPHOMORIC MAETERLINCKPoemsby Maurice Maeterlinck DoddMead and CompanyNew YorkThe publisher of Maeterlinck s Poems states apologetically that there has been a demand for a complete edition of the Belgian s workshence his justification in publishing a translation of the poems that originally appeared twenty years agoThe service rendered thereby to the author is of doubtful value great writers are inclined to forget their youthful follies as far as the English reading public is concerned the little book may be of some interest as a pale suggestion of an early stage in the development of Maeterlinck s talentI say a pale suggestionfor with all the conscientious labor of the translator the poems Anglicised have lost their chiefif not sole value their Verlainean musicalnessIf as a verslibrist Maeterlinck was obviously influenced by Whitmanhis rhymed verses bear the unmistakable stamp of the poet who preached De la musique avant toute chose De la musique encor et toujours Back in the eighties Maeterlinck belonged to the Belgian group of Symbolistswholike ElskampRodenbachvanLerberghVerhaerenreflected the French school which began with Baudelaire and culminated through Rimbaud and Verlaine in MallarméYetunlike his great friendVerhaerenthe Mystic of Silence directed his genius into a different channel and abandoned verse as a medium of expressionIn the collected poemsthe Serres Chaudes and the Chansonsdespite the mentioned influenceswe discover the Maeterlinckian key notethe languor of the oppressed soulhelplessly inactive ina hot house whose doors are closed forever We are dazzled frequently with such beautiful lines asO blue monotony of my heart Green as the sea temptations creep the purple snakes of dream O nights within my humid soul My handsthe lilies of my soulMine eyesthe heavens of my heart A friend confessed to me that these similies reminded him of Bodenheim to be surethis compliment should be laid at the door of the translatorKTHE GREAT AMERICAN NOVELThe Harborby Ernest Poole The Macmillan CompanyNew YorkIn America todayother things being equalthat novelist first achieves success who writes let us say of the social fabricrather than of the eternal veritiesThusin the case of two undoubtedly great artistsJohn Galsworthy and Joseph Conradthe former had to wait but half the latter s time before he came to enjoy real popularity And so it is not difficult to understand the noteworthy and deserved success of The Harbor a book so good that one would be inclined to wonder if it could become popularMrPoole writes with charm and a passionate earnestness of the growth through young manhood of his heroHe knows the New York water front well and it furnishes an original and interesting backgroundThe boy goes through collegeto Europe for a happy year or two and returns to become a successful magazine writer a worshipper at the shrine ofbigmenGradually his social conscience is awakened and his entire life is transformed his allegiance is transferred from the presidents of the corporations who own the steamers to the striking stokers and their fellowsOn the whole the picture is impressively convincing and MrPoole has caught in his pages much of the most glowing thought of idealistic youth His work is so very good that criticism may appear ungracious stillif one may be allowed some of the young men at college speak MrPoole s thoughts and not their ownCollege men do not think as MrPoole would have you believe they do at least not until a year or two after they have graduatedAnd isn t Eleanorethe hero s wifejust a little too perfecteven for the role she has to playHow well an amiable weakness would become herFinallyThe Harbor has the commonest fault of almost all first novels that have for their subject the social fabricthere is too much thought for too little actionthe author wants to give his opinion on all the things he has ever seriously thought about When MrPoole has tempered his fine seriousness with just a little more of the creative artist s austerity he will produce a greater novel than The Harborand one that will fulfill the splendid promise of this first book ALFRED AKNOPFTHE10 000 PLAYChildren of EarthA Play of New Englandby Alice Brozcn The Macmillan CompanyNetu YorkFranklyI do not like the spectacle of a collection of New Englanderswell past middle agesplashing about in a puddle of sexAnd that is what Children of Earth isOf course sex is interesting most of the timeNew Englanders are interesting sometimesespecially when as skilfully drawn as Miss Brown draws thembut the combination is rather too much In the first place what happens to these people of Miss Brown s play never seems of any real importance it isn t simply that they are unsympatheticNor need one believe for a moment in the old idea that in true tragedy the great must sufferBut at least either the great or the typical mustand I cannot feel that these children of earth are eitherThe play is well enough doneit may be compounded of factbut I doubt if it exhibits that finer thing by far truthHow much better work might Winthrop Amesmoney have purchased ALFRED AKNOPFAmerican Thoughtby Woodbridge Riley Henry Holt and CompanyNezv YorkA historical analysis of American philosophical theoriesfrom Puritanism to New Realismthrough the stages of IdealismDeismMaterialismRealismTranscendentalismEvolutionismand PragmatismThe work lacks the strict impartiality of a text bookwhich it evidently intends to beThe author reveals a tendency to prove that American thought has developed independently of European influencesthis appears to be true to a certain extent in regard to Pragmatismas the philosophy of practicality 58 The Little Review The POETRY OF AE Collected Poemsby AE The Macmillan CompanyNew YorkA friend of mine once expressed pained surprise on hearing that AEwas among the poets I delighted to readHaving just heard me dissent from occultismhe could not understand how one who did not believe in theosophyesoteric Buddhismor any of the many modern forms of Mumbojumboism could possibly take delight in a poet whoaccording to himwas a theosophistor revere poems which had first appeared in a theosophical journal Poetryhoweveris not a record of one s beliefs it is a record of one s experiencesand while the existence of God may be asserted and just as easily disprovedin the medium of rhyming languagethere is no question of poetry involvedBut it is equally true that when a poet describes a spiritual experiencethough he may draw his images from Neo Platonic philosophyChristian tradition or even the animatism of the primitive poetsthere is no question of theological belief implied Whenthereforewe open MrRussell s book at randomas I actually did when this volume reached meand come across the following lineswe must be blind to a wide spread experience of mankind if we cannot see that it expresses poetic truth as well as poetic beauty UnconsciousThe windsthe starsand the skiesthough wrought the heavenly Kingyet know it notthe man who moves in the twilight dim not the love that encircles himin hearton bosomand eyelids press of an infinite tendernessturns away through the dark to roam heeds the fire in his hearth and homeBut MrRussell s mysticism and mysticismbeing an attitude rather than an intellectual beliefis something that is legitimately expressible in poetryand is moreover something that MrRussell constantly and beautifully expresses is no mere world flightEven the Beatific Vision he would only accept on terms becoming a man whose life is implicated in humanityHenceunder the title of Love we find him singing Ere I lose myself in the vastness and drowse myself with the peaceI gaze on the light and beauty afar from the dim homes of menI still feel the heart pang and pitylove ties that I would not release the voices of sorrow appealing call me back to their succor againEre I storm with the tempest of power the thrones and dominions of oldthe ancient enchantment allure me to roam through the star misty skieswould go forth as one who has reaped well what harvest the earth may unfoldmy heart be o erbrimmed with compassion on my brow be the crown of the wiseI would go as the dove from the arksent forth with wishes and prayersTo return with the paradise blossoms that bloom in the Eden of light When the deep star chant of the seraphs I hear in the mystical airsMay I capture one tone of their joy for the sad ones discrowned in the night Not alonenot alone would I go to my rest in the heart of the loveWere I tranced in the innermost beautythe flame of its tenderest breathI would still hear the cry of the fallen recalling me back from above To go down to the side of the people who weep in the shadow of death One of MrRussell s poems suggests in its very first line a lyric from Shelley s Hellasand the two poems form an interesting contrast between the temperaments of the poet of sentimental Platonism and this later singer who adds to Shelley s lyric vision a firmer stationing on the substance of earthWhile Shelley began on a high note of joy thatThe world s great age begins anew The golden years return but ends on the note of disenchantmentOceasemust hate and death returnCeasemust men kill and dieCease Drain not to its dregs the urnOf bitter prophecyThe world is weary of the pastOhmight it die or rest at last while Shelley thus descendsMrRussell in The Twilight of Earth begins more or less where Shelley left off withThe wonder of the world is o erThe magic from the sea is goneThere is no unimagined shore No islet yet to venture onThe Sacred Hazel s blooms are shedThe Nuts of Knowledge harvested Ohwhat is worth this lore of age time shall never bring us back battle with the gods to wageReeling along the starry trackThe battle rapture here goes by In warring upon things that die Let be the tale of him whose love Was sighed between white Deidre s breastsIt will not lift the heart aboveThe sodden clay on which it restsLove once had power the gods to bring All rapt on its wild wandering But while Paradise of memories fainter day by day there is no need to cease from life or from aspiration on that account60 The Little Review The power is ours to make or mar Our fate as on the earliest mornThe Darkness and the Radiance areCreatures within the spirit bornYetbathed in gloom too longwe might Forget how we imagined light Not yet are fixed the prison bars The hidden light the spirit owns If blown to flame would dim the starsAnd they who rule them from their thrones And the proud sceptred spirits thence Would bow to pay us reverence Ohwhile the glory sinks within Let us not wait on earth behindBut follow where it fliesand winThe glow againand we may find Beyond the Gateways of the Day Dominion and ancestral sway While in few or none of these poems is mystic thought absent it is never present the expense of poetryand many of the poems find in nature both their occasion and their materialAEs vision is preeminently for the evanescent aspect of thingsespecially for the colors of the changes that come over earth and firmamentThe poem beginningWhen the breath of twilight blows to flame the misty skiesAll its vaporous sapphireviolet glow and silver gleamWith their magic flood me through the gateway of the eyesI am one with the twilight s dream is typical of his response to the vision of the outer world The same sturdy sense of actual values that leads MrRussell to write prose works on co operation and nationalityseeing in these matters no less than in religious ecstasy the ground for the free life of manis evident in the poem On Behalf of Some Irishmen not Followers of TraditionBut lest sturdy commonsense be thought a grotesque piece of praise for a poemlet me add that it is a commonsense illuminated by the purest idealismHow close to earth this idealism moves is shown in the little sketch In Connemara describing the peasant girlWith eyes all untroubled she laughs as she passesBending beneath the creel with the seaweed brownand enmeshing her in the nature mysticism of her race and country William Morris somewhere speaks of the cultured man as one who is in sympathy with past and present and futurea contrast indeed to much latter day doctrineand one is reminded of the phrase by this poet who with such lyrical skill not only embodies all three for usbut knits them together in that unity which alone can bestow on man the values of life which are timelessLLEWELLYN JONES The Reader Critic A Chicago Reader I don t like what THE LITTLE REVIEW or any one else I have read says about SanineToo analytictoo professionalWhatever all the worthies say about the book being dangerousit will not affect any soul a jot if he is not already afflicted What I can say is very inferior critically only a hurried resume of images after I had finishedA garden like a dull green cloud descended to earthtwilight skies with supple moving figuresgardens kaleidoscopichills covered with woodsodors of leaves and grassesa dark abandoned slimy wolf cavern of counterfeitersdew laden grassshadowsduskwhisperseyes in the gloomskies pale green with faint silver stars and dark birdsnight fluttering batsgardens filled with the melody of nightingalesa little dying froglush river banks with wet reeds bendingmysterious wood nymph smilesmystic rays of sunlight illuminating frail flowerscrimson morning starred heavenswoods and streams with lithe shining bodies of humans transformed into nymphs and satyrs a storm that almost breathes of the one in the Pastoral Symphony and Sanine in a flash of lightning is revealed apostrophizing it It hurts and one shrinks into one s skeleton to think that perhaps a setting is obviously made in order to be to the spirit of voluptuous indulgenceBut that feeling goesbecause it is the objective thing after all the colors and odors and atmosphere remain THREE WOMENFGuy DavisChicago There is one kind of worker active in the life of today whose work is not often regarded in the light of artThere is a good reason for this in the fact that the work they are attempting is so vast and vague in character that many people do not even know it is being undertakenThey cannot understand effort on such a scale that the final completed workif it is ever to be completedwill be nothing less than a new social ordera new conception of social valuesactualizing itself in the shape of finer cities and grander and braver citizens on a world scale There are various groups of men and women in this work of reconstructionsome compactly organizedothers notsome more militant in their attitude and some less sobut all tending in the same direction toward a betterfreerand fuller social lifeThis movement is confused and uncertain as far as a definite structural goal is concerned because of the contradictory and sometimes seemingly antagonistic elements that go to make it upSome of the groups have specific architectural plans which they defend with the artist s passion against all other plansor against no planbut the movement as a whole is pragmatic and makes its plans as it goes alongand whatever may be the outcome the aim is at a better worlda world of beauty and goodness in the deepest meaning of those terms If the modern feminists understood great womenwhich they do not often dothey would contend that there is a great significance in the fact that three women stand out prominently in this movement and in a measure at least are representative of three groups which more or less dominate the wholeListing them according to agefor on any other basis comparisons are difficulteach being effective in her own62 The Little ReviewsphereMother JonesEmma Goldmanand Elizabeth Gurley Flynn are social artistsworking in different directionsyet in the same directionnow seeming to exclude each other entirelyand nowno doubtsustaining each other in spirit across the separating gaps in the common purposejust as old agemiddle ageand youth do sometimes in lifeor just as three mountains may have separate and distinct characters and yet be a part of the same range Old Mother Jones is acharacter In her eighty two years she has seen life s stormhas lived its hopefearloveand hateand has mastered itShe will die happy with the knowledge that she did her part in the fight for better thingswhich she may not see but which she believes are coining Emma Goldman is at the height of her creative effortbreaking down the stone walls of prejudice and superstitionfreeing minds from the grip of the pastpreparing the soil for new harvests of life and beautyShe sees mankind on the rack in the agony of a herculean struggleGiant social forces jostle each other in their efforts for recognition in her consciousnessHer attitude toward the revolutionary movement reminds one of the picture of the Earth in Meridith s poem Earth and ManHer fingers dint the breast which is his well of strengthhis home of rest She senses the stirring of new life in the race s womb and she fears a bitfor she sees clearly the possibilities of a tragic miscarriage or a premature birth Elizabeth Gurley Flynn is the young Diana of the labor movementStrongfull of hopepast the fear which accompanies all beginningsfacing the future with the courage and confidence of a youth fully launched on its career and enjoying the sense of growing understanding and power The redeemers of life are those in whose natures this spirit of the creator liveswhether it expresses itself in the labor movement or in the studio and there is a significance in the fact that all three of these leaders come from one classthe workersThe interest in the movement is not by any means confined to the laboring classesso calledbut the real dynamic power back of the movementthe steam which drives it ondoes come from this class and it is more than a coincidence that these three women should all belong to itfor the vital powerthe staying quality which is the condition of real leadershipseems to have been nearly cornered by the laboring elements Mother Jones has broad organizational affiliationsThe great massive groups which go to make up the American Federation of Labor are with hergenerally speakingand lend her moral support and financial aidHer own age and the splendid organization of her mentality are in keeping with the corresponding qualities in theAFof L Emma Goldman stands alone as far as organizations are concernedlike so many great artists in other fieldsalways an isolated figure of heroic beautyalways the creatorlifting the world in spite of itselfMiss Flynn is a part of the Industrial Workers of the Worldthat body of roughneck rebels which carries such promising seeds in its revolutionary young heartHer youth and promise symbolize the possibilities of the IWW But to return to the idea of the social artistWhat splendid compensations there must be in their work To feel that they are part of an historic movement for a new world of beauty and harmonysuch as the Utopians have dreamed of through all history from Plato to Bellamy and Howellsa work which accelerates its speed and power as it draws more and more to its ranks the idealists of all countries and all classesIs it not better for them that they know they will probably not see its completionthat it may take centuriesThey will never be disillusioned as long as they hold to the inner faith To travel hopefully is better than to arriveand here surely is a journeythe end of which will not be reached tomorrowAs to the ultimate outcomewhy doubt itThe race has millions of years ahead of it On the personal side each one of the three has her own unique charmMother Jones is a mother indeedHer attitude towardher boysis more than motherlyit is grand motherlyThe sweetness and childishness of agehowevera sort of a sunset glow of real warmth and virility radiates from herShe enjoys the privileges of ageand they are many to those who know how to accept them gracefully as she doesMiss Flynn enjoys the privileges of youthwhich she likewise accepts with a poise and an ease all her ownEmma Goldman has neither the privileges of youth nor those of ageShe is at that point in her development when in the nature of life she must meet the challenge of the outer world alonewhenthe soul is on the waters and must sink or swim of its own strength And yetno doubt because of this very factshe craves companionship with a passion that sometimes has a quality of blue flameMiddle age has few privileges and many responsibilitiesLife is fairhoweverto the normal individualIt pays in advance to youth and afterward as well to agebut it demands service of those who are in their prime To understand these personalities and others of their kind is to understand much of lifepossibly as much as the individual consciousness in its present form can ever understandTo know of their struggles is to feel that one knows history in the makingIt is not necessary to endorsebut to fail to catch the spirit of their work is to be unprepared for the possible changes which seem to be more or less imminent in the social and industrial US Aas in the world at large Review 63The New Series An attempt to give the best contemporary verse the audience in its own generation that it
