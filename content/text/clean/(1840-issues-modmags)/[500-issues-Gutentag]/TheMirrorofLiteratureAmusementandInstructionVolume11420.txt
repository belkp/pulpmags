VOL . XII . 1828 . PREFACE The present sheet completes the TWELFTH VOLUME OF THE MIRROR . This circumstance alone is typical of the substantial patronage which has attended our exertions from their commencement ; and may be , we hope , anticipatory of continued success . Our career of six years has been subdivided into twelve volumes or sessions ; we have had no recess , but uniformly “ a house ; ” and , as members of the republic of letters , we hope to be re-elected by our numerous constituents . To speak heroically , and as Puff says in the Critic , to “ keep it up , ” their approbation is the air we breathe , If we have it not , we die . Although we do not presume to account for our own success , or to trace its maintenance through all the fluctuations of six years — yet we are prone to believe that the economy of the plan , coupled with the spirit of curiosity which it is our aim to encourage ,— have been the prime movers of our fortunes , as they have been the pivots upon which we have performed our half-yearly revolutions . In these we have allowed neither autumn nor winter to impair our exertions ; and , however time may have worn otherwise with us , we still feel all the youth and freshness of spring-tide , warmed by the genial ray of public favour . The spirit of curiosity to which we here allude , is thus admirably described by Sterne :— “ The love of variety , or curiosity of seeing new things , which is the same , or at least a sister passion to it ,— seems wove into the frame of every son and daughter of Adam ; we usually speak of it as one of nature 's levities , though planted within us for the solid purposes of carrying forwards the mind to fresh enquiry and knowledge : strip us of it , the mind ( I fear ) would doze for ever over the present page ; and we should all of us rest at ease with such objects as present themselves in the parish or province where we first drew our breath . ” Such has been our feeling from the first ; and in pursuing this principle , we have been greatly encouraged by the several contributors , whose signatures abound in every Number of THE MIRROR . To these friends we beg thus briefly to return our sincere thanks . The arrangement of the present Volume , generally , accords with those of its successful predecessors . Fact and fancy ; sentiment , poetry , and popular science ; anecdote and art ; love of nature and knowledge of the world — alternate in its columns . In these several departments popular reading has been our study . With this view , we have paid especial attention to the domestic history — the customs , amusements , and peculiarities — of our own country ; and to such a portion of foreign novelties as bear upon the welfare and interests of the present generation . Economy of time , which is also economy of money or cost , has been the ruling principle of our little literary exchequer ; while our ways and means for the future are equally abundant . The illustrative portion , also , contains many striking novelties , which , as identified with contemporary curiosity , or as performances of art , will , we are persuaded , be duly appreciated . We abstain from further enumeration of the contents or of their respective claims to the reader 's notice . In every Number it has been our endeavour to cater for his “ amusement and instruction , ” so as to combine interest and novelty — or , in a homely phrase , to make each sheet like “ the punch of conversation . ” Thus , we have spirit , volatile and fiery in our leading articles ; lemon in our pungent Notes ; sugar in our “ Gatherer ; ” and water quant . suff .— mixed in a form , which , like old bowls or drinking-glasses , is variegated with figures and scenes of the current fashion — as in our Engravings . But we are getting too figurative , and our Christmas fare , unlike ourselves , is growing cold . So , indulgent reader , we promise to drink your health and return thanks for the same in your absence ; though we had rather you were present to witness and share our exceeding great joy ; and then to commence our Thirteenth Volume . Pardon this exuberance of the season : we reason with Falstaff :— “ If then the tree may be known by the fruit , as the fruit by the tree , then , peremptorily I speak it , there is virtue in that Falstaff : him keep with ; the rest banish . ” Christmas Day , 1828 . PORTRAIT OF THOMAS MOORE , ESQ . MEMOIR OF THOMAS MOORE , ESQ . Thomas Moore , Esq . the only son of Mr. Garret Moore , formerly a merchant in Dublin , was born May 28 , 1780 . He received the rudiments of an excellent education from Mr. Samuel Whyte , of Dublin , a man of taste and talent , known and respected as the early tutor of Sheridan ; after which , at the age of fourteen , Mr. Moore was entered a student of Trinity College , Dublin . While at the University , he was greatly distinguished by his enthusiastic attachment to the liberty and independence of his country , which he more than once publicly asserted with uncommon energy and eloquence . His classical studies being completed , in 1799 , he entered himself of the Temple , with a view to make the law his profession , and was called to the bar . In these moments , when he was not occupied with the dry technicalities and quibbles of legal writers , he amused himself with translating the Odes of Anacreon , which he published with copious notes , in 1800 . Such was Mr. Moore 's youthful appearance at this time , that being at a large dinner party , and getting up to escort the ladies to the drawing-room , a French gentleman observed , “ Ah , le petit bon homme , qu'il s'en va . ” Mr. Moore 's subsequent brilliant conversation , however , soon proved him to be , though little of stature , yet , like Pope , “ in wit , a man . ” Assuming the appropriate name of Little , our author published in 1801 , a volume of poems , chiefly amatory , which , though they established his poetical reputation , were severely censured for their warmth and licentiousness . Their success , however , was very considerable , fifteen or sixteen editions being sold within a short time . In the same year he advertised a work entitled “ Philosophy of Pleasure ; ” but this was never published . Towards the autumn of 1803 , Mr. Moore embarked for Bermuda , where he had obtained the appointment of Registrar to the Admiralty . This was a patent place , and of a description so unsuited to his temper of mind , that he fulfilled the duties of it by deputy , but the profits ultimately proved unworthy of Mr. Moore 's serious attention ; and we believe Mr. Moore has suffered by the villany of this substitute , to an important amount . He likewise visited the United States , and upon his return home , in 1806 , he published his remarks on the American character , in a work entitled “ Epistles , Odes , and other Poems . ” The preface to this little work sufficiently established the talent of Mr. Moore , as a prose writer . His opinion of the Americans is also there pretty freely expressed , and some of the poems , like those ascribed to Little , were objectionable in a moral point of view . The work was accordingly attacked with much severity , by Mr. Jeffrey , the editor of the Edinburgh Review : the irritated poet challenged his critic , but the duel was prevented , and the pistols being found loaded with paper pellets , the whole affair ended pleasantly enough . The fate of Addison , with his Countess Dowager , holding out no encouragement for the ambitious love of Mr. Moore , he wisely and happily allowed his good taste to regulate his choice in a wife , and some years ago married Miss Dyke , a lady of great personal attractions , and accomplished manners , in whose congenial society he passes much of his time in the retirement of an elegant cottage , in Wiltshire , devoting himself chiefly to literary pursuits . In 1808 , Mr. Moore sent to the press “ Corruption and Intolerance ; ” two poems , with notes : addressed to an Englishman , by an Irishman ; and in 1809 , “ The Sceptic , ” a philosophical satire . These works , of which the first is pungently satirical , are little known ; but they are worthy of their author . They were succeeded in 1810 , by “ A Letter to the Roman Catholics of Dublin . ” His next production , “ Intercepted Letters , or the Two-penny Post Bag , by Thomas Brown , the younger , ” 1812 , was eagerly perused , and fourteen editions of it were printed . Its severities on an elevated personage and the court , will perhaps never be forgotten by the parties . In sparkling wit , keen sarcasm , and humorous pleasantry , it is rivalled only by another volume , entitled “ The Fudge Family in Paris , ” published in 1818 , the hero of which is a distinguished poet , and a zealous supporter of the present administration . To this class of Mr. Moore 's works belong his “ Fables for the Holy Alliance , ” and “ Rhymes on the Road , ” which deserve , in some respect , a higher reputation than the former volumes . Mr. Moore appears equally to have cultivated a taste for music as well as for poesy ; and the late Dr. Burney was perfectly astonished at his talent which he emphatically called “ peculiarly his own . ” In 1813 , Mr. Moore 's fame was materially increased by the appearance of his exquisite songs to Sir John Stevenson 's selection of Irish Melodies . Some of these songs are among the finest specimens of poetry in our language , and the morality of the whole of them is unexceptionable . They have since been collected into one volume . In 1816 , he published “ A Series of Sacred Songs , Duets , and Trios , ” the music to which was composed and selected by himself and Sir John Stevenson . In 1817 , came forth his great work , on which he was known to have been long engaged , and which if it had been his only production , would have carried his name down to posterity as one of the first bards of his time . “ Thoughts that breathe , and words that burn , ” would not be an inapplicable motto for this oriental romance , which unites the purest and softest tenderness with the loftiest dignity , and glows in every page with all the fervour of poetry . For the copyright of this poem he is said to have received the sum of 3 , 000 guineas , and it must have proved a source of immense profit to the publishers . In 1818 , Mr. Moore visited his native city , Dublin , on which occasion our poet was invited to a public dinner , which was graced by a large assemblage of the most distinguished literary and political characters . The Earl of Charlemont took the chair ; Mr. Moore sat on his right hand , Mr. Moore , sen. a venerable old gentleman , the father of the poet , was on the left . On Lord Charlemont proposing “ The living Poets of Great Britain , ” Mr. Moore said — “ Gentlemen , notwithstanding the witty song which you have just heard , and the flattering elevation which the author has assigned me , I cannot allow such a mark of respect to be paid to the illustrious names that adorn the literature of the present day , without calling your attention awhile to the singular constellation of genius , and asking you to dwell a little on the brightness of each “ particular star ” that forms it . Can I name to you a Byron , without recalling to your hearts recollections of all that his mighty genius has awakened there , his energy , his burning words , his intense passion , that disposition of fine fancy to wander only among the ruins of the heart , to dwell in places which the fire of feeling has desolated , and like the chestnut-tree , that grows best in volcanic soils , to luxuriate most where conflagration of passion has left its mark ? Need I mention to you a Scott , that fertile and fascinating writer , the vegetation of whose mind is as rapid as that of a northern summer , and as rich as the most golden harvests of the south , whose beautiful creations succeed each other like fruits in Armida 's enchanted garden , “ one scarce is gathered ere another grows ? ” Shall I recall to you a Rogers , ( to me endeared by friendship as well as genius ,) who has hung up his own name on the shrine of memory among the most imperishable tablets there . A Southey , not the laureate , but the author of ‘ Don Roderick , ’ one of the noblest and most eloquent poems in any language . A Campbell , the polished and spirited Campbell , whose song of ‘ Innisfail ’ is the very tears of our own Irish muse , crystallized by the touch of genius , and made eternal . A Wordsworth , a poet , even in his puerilities , whose capacious mind , like the great pool of Norway , draws into its vortex not only the mighty things of the deep , but its minute weeds and refuse . A Crabbe , who has shown what the more than galvanic power of talent can effect , by giving not only motion , but life and soul to subjects that seemed incapable of it . I could enumerate , gentlemen , still more , and from thence would pass with delight to dwell upon the living poets of our own land . The dramatic powers of a Maturin and a Shiel , the former consecrated by the applause of a Scott and a Byron , and the latter by the tears of some of the brightest eyes in the empire . The rich imagination of a Philips , who has courted more than one Muse . The versatile genius of a Morgan , who was the first that mated our sweet Irish strains with poetry worthy of their pathos and their force . But I feel I have already trespassed too long upon your patience and your time . I do not regret , however , that you have deigned to listen with patience to this humble tribute to the living masters of the English lyre , which I , ‘ the meanest of the throng , ’ thus feebly , but heartily , have paid them . ” Towards the close of 1822 , Mr. Moore published “ The Loves of the Angels , ” a poem of exquisite tenderness and beauty . The object of the poet is , by an allegorical medium , to shadow out the fall of the soul from its original purity — the loss of light and happiness which it suffers , in the pursuit of this world 's perishable pleasures — and the punishments from conscience and Divine justice . Soon after the death of Lord Byron , in 1824 , Mr. Moore became involved in a dispute which involved many private feelings . The facts may be thus briefly stated :— It appears that about two years previous to his death , Lord Byron wrote his own Memoirs , which , according to Captain Medwin , were given “ to Moore , or Moore 's little boy , at Venice , ” with the observation of “ Here 's 2 , 000l . for you , my young friend ; ” and that they were not to be published till after his lordship 's death . On the completion of the Memoirs , Lord Byron wrote to his lady , proposing to send them for her inspection ; but she rejected the offer , desiring that they might never appear , and finishing with a threat . Lord Byron concluded his reply by saying , that “ she might depend on their being published ; ” and his lordship further says , “ It was not till after this correspondence that I made Moore the depositary of the MS . ” Mr. Moore subsequently disposed of the MS. to Mr. Murray , the bookseller , for the sum of 2 , 000 guineas ; but , at the anxious wish of some of Lord Byron 's relatives , the purchase-money was returned to Mr. Murray , and the MS. was burnt . The circumstances being so recent , we do not think it requisite to enlarge upon them . Mr. Moore has since entered into an agreement with his publishers for a Life of Lord Byron , and a few weeks since the first portion of the copy was sent to the printer . Almost simultaneous with the above affair was the publication of Mr. Moore 's “ Memoirs of Captain Rock , the celebrated Irish Chieftain , ” — a work of political , humorous , and satirical character , turning upon the wrongs and riots of Ireland , with which , as our readers will allow , we have here little to do . It contains great historical research , and had its day ; but the gratification in the perusal is of a very mixed character . Its success , however , was sufficient to induce the publication of an imitative work entitled “ Captain Rock 's Letters to the King , ” which was “ certainly not written by Mr. Moore , to whom , while the publication was suspended , they were so positively ascribed . ” In the following year , Mr. Moore published the “ Memoirs of the Right Hon . R. B . Sheridan , ” having previously edited an edition of his works . In these Memoirs , Mr. Moore has done justice to the character of Sheridan , neither concealing his follies and vices , nor magnifying his good qualities . We quote a paragraph from this work for the purpose of introducing a portion of some very beautiful lines by Mr. Moore , which first appeared in the Morning Chronicle , immediately after Sheridan 's death . “ There appeared some verses at the time , which , however intemperate in their satire and careless in their style , came , evidently , warm from the heart of the writer , and contained sentiments to which , even in his cooler moments he needs not hesitate to subscribe :— “ Oh it sickens the heart to see bosoms so hollow , And friendships so false in the great and high-born ;— To think what a long line of titles may follow The relics of him who died , friendless and lorn ! “ How proud they can press to the funeral array Of him whom they shunn 'd , in his sickness and sorrow — How bailiffs may seize his last blanket to-day , Whose pall shall be held up by Nobles to-morrow ! ” The anonymous writer thus characterises the talents of Sheridan :— “ Was this then the fate of that high-gifted man , The pride of the palace , the bower , and the hall — The orator , dramatist , minstrel ,— who ran Through each mode of the lyre , and was master of all ? “ Whose mind was an essence , compounded , with art . From the finest and best of all other men 's powers ; Who rul 'd , like a wizard , the world of the heart , And could call up its sunshine , or draw down its showers ; “ Whose humour , as gay as the fire-fly 's light , Play 'd round every subject , and shone as it play 'd ; Whose wit , in the combat as gentle as bright , Ne'er carried a heart-stain away on its blade ,— “ Whose eloquence , brightening whatever it tried , Whether reason or fancy , the gay or the grave , Was as rapid as deep , and as brilliant a tide , As ever bore Freedom aloft on its wave ! "[ 1 ] In 1827 , appeared “ The Epicurean , ” a tale of extreme grace and feeling , and conveying the sublime lessons of Epicurus , in one of the most attractive of poetico-prosaic forms . In picturesque knowledge , splendid descriptions , startling and mysterious incidents , and intellectual riches , this work is almost unparalleled in our language ; and , observes an elegant critic , “ the narrative sweeps along , like a mild and glassy river winding through banks of the most brilliant verdure , sometimes sparkling and bubbling to the sunshine of fancy , and at intervals solemnly gliding on with a deep under-current of philosophy . ” The contributions of Mr. Moore to one of the most powerful of the London journals are too well recognised by the public to require further than a passing notice of their being recently published in an elegant little volume , entitled “ Odes upon Cash , Corn , Catholics , and other Matters ; ” and we believe them to be entitled by their raciness and humour to a niche in the library , beyond the destructible form of a newspaper . In this brief Memoir , we have little more than glanced at Mr. Moore 's several works , and the periods of their publication ; although we could crowd our pages with the highest testimonials of their poetical and literary merits . Much as we admire “ his wit , his festive merriment , and inimitable satires , and the ingenious imagery , and the elaborate melody and finish of every period of his prose ” — we are disposed to think him pre-eminently successful in delineating the plaintive and pensive woes of deep and settled melancholy : thus — As a beam o'er the face of the waters may glow , While the tide runs in darkness and coldness below ; So the cheek may be tinged with a warm sunny smile , Though the cold heart to ruin runs darkly the while . We have already noticed the taste of Mr. Moore for music . “ Nor has he neglected those more solid attainments which should ever distinguish the well-bred gentleman , for he is an excellent general scholar , and particularly well-read in the literature of the middle ages . His conversational powers are great , and his modest and unassuming manners have placed him in the highest rank of cultivated society . ” Although his reputation is so well established , he speaks of himself with his wonted modesty . “ Whatever fame he might have acquired he attributed principally to the verses which he had adapted to the delicious strains of Irish melody . His verses , in themselves , could boast of but little merit ; but like flies preserved in amber , they were esteemed in consequence of the precious material by which they were surrounded . ” Sheridan , in speaking of the subject of this memoir , said “ That there was no man who put so much of his heart into his fancy as Tom Moore ; that his soul seemed as if it were a particle of fire separated from the sun ; and was always fluttering to get back to that source of light and heat . ” Lord Byron , too , distinguished Moore as “ a name consecrated by unshaken public principle , and the most undoubted and various talents . ” [ 1 ] Moore 's Sheridan , vol . ii . p. 463 .
