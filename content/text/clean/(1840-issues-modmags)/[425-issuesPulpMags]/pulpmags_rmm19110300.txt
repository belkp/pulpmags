Naturalness

—that should be every woman’s
aim. The further she gets
away from that standard, the
less attractive she becomes.
It is the true test of manners,
apparel, and personal charm.
Indeed, it is the very key-note
of beauty. Naturalness of skin
and complexion is therefore
beauty’s most essential
element. This being so,

Woman’s Pears’
Natural Soap

Charm

which is entirely composed of
natural cleansing, beautifying
ingredients, forms the best
promoter and preservative of
skin-beauty that money can buy
or science produce. PEARS
has been woman’s natural
beauty soap for 120 years.

   PEARS makes the skin as fine as

   silk and as soft as velvet and is

Matchless for the Complexion

      "All rights secured "

OF ALL SCENTED SOAPS PEARS' OTTO OF ROSE IS THE BEST.

Take Your Oliver Typewriter
-Pay Seventeen
Cents a Day!

Send Coupon or Letter for Details

A message of vital moment to the vast
audience reached by this magazine.

IVe are selling the Oliver Typewriter—the Standard
Visible Writej—the New Model No. J—the regular $100
machine—-for Seventeen Cents a Day! Whether you sit in
the councils of great corporations or are perched on a
bookkeeper’s high stool—whatever your part in the
world's activities—this offer of the Oliver Typewriter
means something worth while to you.

Mightiest Machine in World’s Workshop

The terrific pace of modern business demands mechanical
aids of the highest degree of efficiency. Foremost among all
the inventions that speed the day's work—that take the tension
from men and transfer it to machines—is the Oliver Typewriter.

The Oliver Typewriter is the mightiest machine in the World's
Workshop. It weaves the million threads of the world's daily
transactions into the very fabric of business. It works with the
smooth precision of an automatic machine. It adapts itself to
the diversified needs of ten thousand business conditions.

Ttjc-^

OLIVER

Typcwri^i*

The Standard Visible Writer

The basic idea upon which its towering supremacy rests is its wonderful
Double Type-Bar. What the Selden patent is to the automobile, this princi-
ple is to the typewriter, only we do not license its use on any other li’ritinn machine.

The Double Type-Bar gives the Oliver Typewriter its positive DOWN-
WARD STROKE, the secret of perfect printing, light touch, easy operation and
perfect alignment.

Brilliant Exclusive
Features

   The Oliver is illuminated by scores of
 brilliant innovations not found on other
 typewriters. Its remarkable time-saving
 devices and conveniences include the
 Vertical and Horizontal Line Ruler, the
 Disappearing’ Indicator, the Tabulator,
 the Back-Spacer, the Adjustable Paper
 Feed, the Double Release, the Automatic
 Spacer, the Locomotive Base.

   Time and again, when our existing
 models met every demand of the public,
 we have brought*out important improve-
 ments at great expense, without adding
 a cent to the price.

100% Efficiency

   The Oliver Typewriter has an efficiency
 of 100 per cent, every day in the week
 and from one year’s end to another.

   Its printing mechanism works freely
 in a framework of solid steel, which
 gives wonderful stability and the limit
 of durability.

   It operates with the lightest touch and
 thus prevents fatigue. The swiftest
 operator cannot overtake the speed of an
 Oliver Typewriter. It writes in beauti-
 ful, readable type and, of course, it
 writes in sight.

   Every office, whether equipped with
 one Oliver Typewriter or a battery of
 Olivers, secures the very maximum of
 typewriter service at the minimum of
 cost and labor.

   The simplicity, strength and easy
 operation of the Oliver Typewriter make
 it most desirable for use in the home.

 Why I Want to Lend You This Phonograph

  I know tliat there arc thousands of people who have never heard the
  Genuine Edison Phonograph. Now, there’s only one way to convince
  people that t he Edison is superior, and that is to let theni actually see
  and hear this remarkable instrument for themselves. That is why I
  am making this offer. The only 7t>ay to make yon actually real-
  ize the <’ things for yourself is to loan you a Genuine Edison Phono-
  graph free and let you try it.

                                 All I ask you to do is to invite as
  many as possible of your friends to
  hear this wonderful Fireside Edison.
  I feel absolutely certain that out of the number of your friends who will
  hear your machine there will be at least one and probably more who
  will want an Edison of his own. If there isn't (and this sometimes
  happens) I won’t blame you in the least. You won’t be asked to act
  as our agent or even assist in the sale of a single instrument.

of a Shoe to Buy

Study these cuts, then go to your dealer and ask for a
pair of shoes made with a

GOODYEAR

 WELT

   The manufacturer or dealer who advertises that he
makes or sells a Goodyear Welt thereby assures you
tiiat he offers a shoe possessing the first requisite of
excellence — a shoe, made by machines, which is as
comfortable, durable and stylish as one hand-sewed—
at only one-third the cost.

Stitch seam

Indentations
Between Stitches

    A thin and narrow strip of leather called a welt is
first sewed to the insole and upper. The outsole is
then sewed to this welt, leaving the stitches outside
so that the insole is left entirely smooth.

    When you purchase shoes, see if there is a “sock” lining
or thin piece of leather or cloth covering the sole on the inside.
If there is. lift it up at the shank of the shoe.’ If points and
stitches show underneath it. th>- shoe is not a Goodyear Welt.

Write today for the following booklets
which will be sent you without cost:

    1.	Contains an alphabetical list of over five hundred shoes
sold und.r a special name or trade mark, made by the Good

The Quick Way to Make
the Best Soup

M r s. W. K. Harley,
Texas—“I find that
Armour’s Extract of
Beef saves me time,
worry and expense. I
have long depended
upon it to help me out
in my cooking a n d
could hardly keep
house without it. I
should advise every
housekeeper to send
for that valuable little
cook book, ‘ Popular
Recipes,’ and learn
how it helps them
economize.”

What Users
Say

Mrs. H. C. F., Seattle,
Washington — “I use

Armour's Extract of
Beef many ways to
great advantage, but
will cite only one. A
little added to a glass
of milk gives a flavor
that is a pleasant
change both for baby
and his grand-
mother.”

   Order a jar of Armour’s Extract of Beef
 from your grocer. Notice its richness and
 appetizing aroma.

  Then make your soup according to the
 cook book rule—all but the stock. When
 your recipe says “ add stock,” get out your
 Armour’s Extract of Beef and allow a tea-
 spoonful to ever}' quart of liquid.

   You will have the most satisfactory soup
 you have ever served, with a delightful
 flavor that ordinary soups cannot boast.

  For Armour’s Extract of Beef is the
 richest, most concentrated soup stock any
 cook could wish.

   One jar costs little more than the materi-
 als necessary for a small suppljr of old-fash-
 ioned soup stock, and it goes twice as far.

   It saves fuel, time and trouble—no more
 stewing over the kitchen stove.

            A postal mailed to Armour & Company, Chicago, will bring you “ Popular
            Recipes "—free. It will show you the many uses of Armour’s Extract of Beef.

Save the cap or the paper cer-
tificate under the cap from every
jar of Armour’s Extract of Beef
you buy. Send either to us with

10	cents to pay for carriage and
packing. We will send you a beau-
tiful silver tea, bouillon or after-
dinner coffee spoon or butter

 spreader free — Wm. Rogers &
 Sons’ AA — in an artistic design
 known as the Armour Lily Pat-
 tern, each marked with your initial.

 Whims of the Wheels.

BY CHARLES FREDERICK CARTER.

WHEREVER things are continually on the move.—as they are along the
right-of-way,—there are hound to be enough cuts and shuffles in Fate’s
great game to turn up any number of quaint and amusing incidents.
In this respect, railroad men above all others have little cause to complain of
the monotony of daily routine.

    The odd, the humorous, and the unexpected are always cropping up. on
the trains, iu the yards, and all over the length and breadth of a great system.
Mr. Carter, who, as you all know, is a veteran railroader, has gathered a few
of these tales of travel, ranging in their scope from Maine to California, all of
which ring as true as a sound wheel, though some are as weird and marvelous
as stories from the Arabian Nights.

Humorous Situations, Narrow Escapes, Queer Encounters, Freak Ac-
cidents, and Other Peculiar Happenings Both
Off and On Moving Trains.

 YOUNG Western couple took it
 into their heads to elope in
 the month of roses and wed-
 yJBQbJk’ dings several years ago.

            They boarded a train on
the Southern Pacific and got
out into Nevada, when they decided that
the wedding ceremony simply could not be
postponed another minute. Accordingly
they wired ahead for the agent at Winne-
mucca to procure a license and a justice of
the peace for them.

  Having been taught that it was his sacred
duty to please the patrons of the road, the
agent immediately procured the license.

1 RR	,

Being a justice of the peace himself, he
was ready to do his duty, and boarded the
train before it had come to a stop at the
station platform.

  Meanwhile the dining-car had been
cleared of tables and chairs, and the bridal
pair was waiting. The chef and a couple
of waiters with mandolins and guitars
played the wedding-march, the agent read
the service, the conductor gave the bride
away, and then the Pullman passengers, in
their capacity of wedding guests, sat down
to the best the car could afford.

  Pitched in a different key was an in-
cident that occurred in the same month and

year on the Louisville and Nashville, near
Birmingham, Alabama. About four o’clock
in the morning a coach full of dozing pas-
sengers was suddenly roused by a series of
blood-curdling shrieks. When they looked
for the cause, they found a woman perched
on the back of a seat staring with protru-
ding eyes at the floor beneath. When she
was able to explain, she said she had felt
something squirming between her feet, and
upon investigating found it was a six-foot
rattlesnake. The whole car-load instantly
concluded that it could hear further par-
ticulars to much better advantage from the
backs of the seats, so the change of loca-
tion was accordingly made, while a hurry
call was turned in for the train crew.

  The conductor and two brakemen broke
open a tool-box, from which they armed
themselves with axes, sledges, and saws.
The rattlesnake, whose sensibilities had
been hurt by the unseemly conduct of the
passengers, put up such a spirited fight that
the interior of the car was in ruins before
it was finally despatched. The mystery of
its presence was explained by a telegram
awaiting the conductor at the next station.

  It was from the owner of the snake, say-
ing that his prize had escaped from its
box, and that he had not discovered his
loss until after leaving the car. Would
the conductor please take good care of it?
What the conductor said need not be re-
peated here. Such things should be for-
gotten.

Close Shaves with the Reaper.

  Passengers who have been pluming
themselves on their adventure in the New
Haven coach, which, in the month of June,
1910, jumped the rails, while running
twenty-five miles an hour, bounced along
on the ties for a few car-lengths, and then
flopped over on its side without hurting
any one, will be taken down several pegs
on learning that their experience was noth-
ing when compared with an incident that
occurred March 24, 1901, at Columbus,
Ohio.

  A Big Four freight-train had stopped
on a crossing, when a Baltimore and Ohio
passenger-train, mistaking or disregarding
signals, or perchance misled by a wrong
signal, dashed between two cars, pushing
them apart wide enough to make room for
the passage of the train, with no harm to
anything except the varnish on the coaches

and the draw-bars on the box cars. No
one was so much as scratched. After the
danger was over the fireman realized that
he should have jumped, and, as he had
always been told that “ it’s better late than
never,” he forthwith proceeded to jump.
Score, one broken jaw.

  This was completely outdone, however,
on August 22, 1909, when a passenger-
train on the Great Northern, near Darts,
Washington, fell through a bridge which
had been burned by a brush fire, to the
ground, forty feet below, without killing
or fatally injuring any one.

  Even this pales into insignificance when
compared with the feat of another Great
Northern train, a freight, which, on May
27, 1901, ran into a push-car which a con-
tractor’s gang tried too late to hustle in on
a siding. This trifling affair probably
would never have been heard of if there
had not been over a ton of dynamite on
the push-car.

  As it was, the locomotive was blown
completely off the track, everything was
stripped off the boiler, a great kole was
torn in the road-bed, several box cars, a
steam-shovel, and a trackman’s shanty,
seventy-five feet away, were utterly demol-
ished. It seems incredible, yet no one, not
even the engine crew, was hurt.

What One Engine Did.

  This is doing pretty well, but, after all,
the palm really belongs to a Rock Island
switch-engine. This switch-engine, which
was old enough to have outgrown the reck-
lessness of youth, but belonged to the age
when they made throttle-valves that would
not always stay put, was standing sedately
enough on a side-track at Council Bluffs,
Iowa, on January 17, 1901, with no one
on board.

  Presently a Wabash passenger-train came
along. It was attending strictly to its own
business, but the switch engine took ex-
ception to it. The yarder’s throttle flew
open, and it dashed through a split switch,
butted a coach off the Wabash train and
sent it sprawling into the ditch. The
shock derailed the switcher, but it scram-
bled along on the ties until it ran into a
Union Pacific switch-engine and knocked
it also into the ditch.

  This second shock deflected the Rock
Island engine far enough for it to reach
over and yank the engine off an incoming

 passenger-train of its own line and hurl it
 into the ditch. Then it stopped with its nose
 in the dirt and its cab tilted at a rakish
 angle to gloat over the ruin it had wrought.
 In all this weird mix-up no one was seri-
 ously injured.

The Trials of a Trespasser.

   Still, any one who fools around a rail-
 road must take his chances of getting hurt.
 There was a North Caro-
 linian who took the broad
 and easy path afforded by
 the railroad on his way to
 a turkey - blind with his
 trust}' double-barreled shot-
 gun, containing a heavy
 charge of buckshot in each
 barrel. As related by Gen-
 eral Manager L. E. John-
 son, of the Norfolk and
 Western, the turkey-hunter
 presently met a fast train,
 and, with true Southern
 chivalry, stepped aside and
 gave it the whole road.

   A little scrub-bull which
 had also wandered onto the
 track was less polite, how-
 ever. Instead of getting
 out of the way, the bull
 drew a mark in the ballast
 with one forefoot, threw
 some dirt on his back, and then, with low-
 ered head, dared the train to cross the
 mark. Well, it crossed the mark all right,
 at fifty miles an hour, and the bull—oh!
 where was he?

   Probably no one could answer that ques-
 tion in full, but it is known that for a very
 brief fraction of a second the bull and the
 turkey-hunter both tried to occupy the same
 spot at the same time, which, as every
 one knows, is impossible. The result was
 that the turkey-hunter was knocked into
 a pond, which broke his fall and un-
 doubtedly saved his life. He was severe-
 ly hurt. His shotgun was knocked out of
 his hands, and in falling was discharged,
 and two cows that had the misfortune to
 be in range of the buckshot were killed.

 ^ When he recovered, the turkey-hunter,
 as was natural, sued the railroad company
 for illegally, unlawfully, and against the
 peace of the sovereign State of North
 Carolina, throwing one bull at him by
 which aforesaid illegal and unlawful act

 he suffered grievous bodily harm. At the
 same time, which probably was also nat-
 ural, the owner pf the cows sued the tur-
 key-hunter for shooting them.

  After two notable trials, the unfeeling
court held that the railroad company owed
the turkey-hunter nothing for hitting him
with a bull, but that he owed the farmer
one hundred dollars for killing his cows.
When such things as this can happen, is it
any wonder that railroads are unpopular?

THE PASSENGERS WERE SUDDENLY AROUSED BY
A SERIES OF BLOOD-CURDLING SHRIEKS.

  No, he who wants justice from a rail-
road will get quicker action if he takes
matters into his own hands. There was
a Kentuckian whose cow was killed by a
Louisville and Nashville train a dozen
years ago. When the engine that killed
the cow came through on its next trip the
owner of the cow was at the station wait-
ing for it. Stepping up to the engineer,
he demanded pay for the cow.

  “Oh, that’s all right!” airily replied
196

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

the engineer. “ The company will pay as
soon as it gets around to it.”

  “ Look-a-hyar, stranger,” replied the
Kentuckian, “ Ah do’ know the company,
but Ah know you-all killed my cow; and
if you-all doan’ pay fo’ her All’ll fill you
so full of holes they kin use yer carcass
for a colander. Do you heah me?”

  The cow was paid for on the spot.

  Another man who was too shrewd to
trust his cause to the blind goddess was
a passenger in a Pullman car which left
the rails near a bridge on the Norfolk and
Western a few years ago, and plunged
down the bank into a river, that was swollen
by a freshet. The doors being closed, the
windows being double, and the trucks hav-
ing dropped off, the car filled slowly as it
floated down the river.

  It was very early, before the passengers
were up. The men inside broke open the
ventilators, and, with the aid of outside
help, all hands were rescued. There were
two women passengers who tumbled out of
their berths, clad only in their night-robes
and with their hair done up in curl-papers.

  They had to hang on to the curtain-
pole with the water up to their arms; and
it certainly looked as if they were going
to drown with the rest of the passengers.
Yet General Manager Johnson declares
upon his honor that when they were res-
cued their hair was neatly done up. How
they managed it, sloshing around in the
water nearly to their chins, with death
staring them in the face, only a woman
can understand.

His Modest Claim.

  Among the passengers was one man
who alone in all that carful did not put in
a claim for enormous damages for lost
baggage. On the contrary, he was very
active and very helpful to the company in
resisting unreasonable and unjust demands.
Naturally the company felt very grateful.

  One day the considerate man was asked
what he had lost. Very modestly he con-
fessed that he had lost a satchel contain-
ing a quantity of costly clothing, inclu-
ding some fine silk underwear, but he made
WHIMS OF THE WHEELS.

197

no claim for this. The company was try-
ing hard to get along, and he believed in
doing to others as he would that others
should do to him.

  Besides that, he was only too glad to get
out alive. Still, he also
had in that satchel a
watch and some jewelry,
mere trinkets, worth al-	Y

together $250. Rather	^

than have any trouble
about it, he would allow
the company to pay him
for the watch and jew-
elry; that is, if it really
insisted. What could the
company do but shell
out $250 as quickly as
the money could be
counted ?

  In due time the car
was fished out of the
river, and in it the lost
satchel of the consider-
ate one was found. Here
is an inventory of its
contents: One cotton
shirt, one pair cotton
socks, two collars, one
pair cuffs, half-pint
whisky.

  However, it is not al-
ways the cunning pas-
senger w h o triumphs
over the grasping corpo-
ration, but, on the con-
trary, it is the passenger who sometimes gets
the worst of it. When the Erie was newer
than it is now, Conductor James Tinney, in
going out of Jersey City, came to a passen-
ger, a woman with a baby, who refused to
pay her fare.

Infant Indemnity.

  She gave no reasons, she did not argue,
she simply declined to pay for riding to
Paterson. Did Conductor Tinney get
nasty and act rude to a lady? Not he.
Rule No. 8 of the rules and regulations
of the New York and Erie Railroad, in
effect March 6, 1837, read: “Rudeness or
incivility to passengers will, in all cases,
meet with immediate punishment.” Con-
ductor Tinney was not hunting for pun-
ishment. At the same time railroads in
those eaTly days had a rule in effect like
No. 5 of the rules and regulations of the

Concord and Clermont R. R., in effect
January 1, 1850, which read as follows:
“If fares are refused to be paid, or
checks delivered, they (the conductors)
will secure themselves, if practicable, by

STARTED TOWARD THE
BAGGAGE-CAR WITH A
BUSINESSLIKE AIR,

the detention of baggage or by removing
the person from the cars.”

  As the lady had no baggage, Conductor
Tinney could not secure himself; all he
could do was to bow courteously and pass
on. He even went further than that.
When the lady alighted at Paterson, it
was Conductor Tinney who was on hand
to help her down. He even went so far as
to take the baby while she stepped to the
platform. When she held out her arms
for her darling, Conductor Tinney, smiling
sweetly, said:

  “Now, madame, when you pay your
fare you can have the baby.”

  “ I won’t pay you a cent.”

  “Very well, then, I'll keep the baby.
198

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

It’s a mighty fine boy and dirt cheap at
the price.”

  With that he tucked the baby under one
arm and started toward the baggage-car
with a businesslike air. The lady fol-
lowed, at first in a rage, then in tears.
Then she opened a well-filled pocketbook,
showing that she had not refused to pay
for her ride from lack of means, handed
over the exact change, and received her
baby and a bow that Beau Brummel never
equaled in his good-for-nothing life.

A Celestial Strategist.

  Not all railroad employees are the equal
of Conductor Tinney, unfortunately for
the railroads. In 1877 silver was at a
discount in California; that is to say, no
one would accept more than ten dollars of
it in one payment. One day a Chinaman
walked into the Southern Pacific ticket of-
fice at San Francisco and asked for three
tickets to Stockton. On being told that
the price was ten dollars and a half, he
counted out the sum in silver.

  “ You'll have to give me gold for these,”
said the agent icily7, holding on to the
pasteboards.

  “Ah you too muchee smartee; you no
catchee gold allee time,” retorted the
Chinaman, shoving the silver over.

  “ Come now, fork over the gold; you
know the rule.”

  The Chinaman scooped the coins back
into his pocket. Then, with a cold glitter
in his almond eyes, he snapped:

  “How muchee one ticket Stockton?”
  “Three dollars and a half.”

  “You takee silver one ticket?”

  “Yes.”

  “ Gimme one ticket Stockton.”

The silver was counted out and the
ticket was tucked into an inside pocket.

  Again the Chinaman demanded: “ Gim-
me one ticket Stockton.”

  After the second transaction had been
brought to a successful conclusion and the
silver transferred to the railroad till, the
celestial traveler, for a third time, laid
down three dollars and a half in silver
coin and said:

  “ Gimme one ticket Stockton.”

  Picking up the third ticket, his face ex-
panded into a heathen leer as he said to
the discomfited agent:

  “You too muchee smartee.”

But speaking of railroad rules and the

fidelity with which they are observed, the
prize incident occurred on the Watford-
Rickmansworth branch of the London and
Northwestern in 1873. On this branch,
five miles long, there was only one train,
but it was operated on the staff system, in
which the only rights recognized are con-
ferred by the possession of a steel wand.

  One day the solitary train was made up
at Watford, and the passengers were shut
in ready to depart for the junction, when it
was discovered that the staff was missing.
It had been forgotten and left at Rickmans-
worth on the up trip.

  Now, the rules explicitly provided that
the branch must be operated by the staff
system; there was not a word about run-
ning trains on time-card rights or on train
orders. Clearly there was nothing to do
but send a guard on foot to Rickmans-
worth, five miles awav, for the missing
staff in order to release the train; there-
fore it was done, and the train finally
proceeded strictly according to regulations,
but two and a half hours late. Of course
the passengers missed their connections,
but what did that signify?

  That was wonderful presence of mind,
for an English railroad man, but not
quite up to the exploit of Dennis Cassin,
an engineer on the New York Central, who
was coining south through Sing Sing with
a freight-train in May, 1875. Cassin was
following as close as the rules allowed be-
hind a passenger-train.

He Gave Her the Water Cure.

  As he was running slow and had three
gages of water, he shut off the pumps en-
tirely; for in those days they stuck to the
good old pump. He had barely done so
when five convicts dropped from a bridge
down on the tank, and rushing into the
cab with cocked revolvers, they ordered Cas-
sia and his fireman off.

  It was a bold attempt at escape, which
would have succeeded but for Cassin. He
knew better than to attempt resistance, and
he also knew something about locomotives.
As he climbed off his seat-box, he reached
down and turned the little lever beside
the boiler-head, opening the pump-valves
wide.

  His act was not understood by the con-
victs, who instantly opened the throttle
and shot down the track after the pas-
senger-train. The prospects for a terrible
WHIMS OF THE WHEELS.

199

wreck seemed bright. With those reckless
desperadoes in the cab it undoubtedly
would have occurred if it had not been for
Cassin.

  With both pumps wide open the boiler
was flooded, the water began going through
the throttle-valve, and the locomotive came
to a stop with both cylinder-heads knocked
out before it had gone three miles. It was
therefore unnecessary to turn it into the

river at a switch, as had been ordered when
Cassin gave the alarm.

  If that incident had occurred a quarter
of a century later Cassin would have re-

               being praised and petted
               for doing their duty.

                 There was the case of
              Major Rogers, the capable
              but eccentric American
              engineer who did such ef-
              fective work in surveying
              the Canadian Pacific. It
              was Major Rogers who
              found a practicable route
              across the Selkirks. The
              7pass was named in his

--Z honor.

                 Altogether, the major
rendered such valuable
services that the pleased
and grateful company
voted him a bonus of five
thousand dollars. To die unutterable dis-
tress of the auditor, months rolled by and
the check was not presented for payment.
At last Major Rogers paid a visit to head-

ceived ten credit marks and a letter from
the superintendent, and perhaps even a
gold watch or something, but in the good
old days railroad men were not used to

r

quarters, and General Manager Van Horne
took occasion to ask why the check had not
been cashed.

His Only Testimonial.

  “ Good Heavens, sir! That is the only
testimonial I have. I have had it framed
and glazed, and it hangs over my bed. I
shall never part with it.”

  Van Horne changed the subject. Next
day he bought a fine gold watch, had a
suitable inscription to the effect that it
was presented to Major Rogers by the C.

P. R., and so forth. The watch was kept
in the general manager’s desk awaiting
Major Rogers’s next visit.

  On that occasion Van Horne took out
the watch, showed it to the engineer with-
out letting go of it, and read him the in-
scription. Then he returned the watch to
the drawer, which he ostentatiously locked.
The major’s smile of delight faded into
an open-eyed look of dismay.

  “Why—why, don’t I get the watch?”
he asked.

  “ Certainly you get it whenever you
present that check and draw your money.”

BOOMING THE TOWN.

A COMMERCIAL traveler who was going
through a certain State for the first time,
alighted at a way-station which was named for a
politician of national renown. He looked about
for the town; but there were only a few forlorn
houses. Then he looked about for the station;
there was only an old freight-car—a small, old-
style car, of 40,000 pounds capacity, rigged up
with steps leading to its wide-open middle door.
The traveler climbed up and peered inside. A
pine table held a languidly-ticking telegraph in-
strument, and in a far corner the station-master
leaned back in his chair, his feet on the telegraph-
table. There was no one else-in sight.

  “ Where’s your town ? ” asked the traveler.

  The station-master pointed with his thumb
toward the few houses outside.

  “ What! ” the traveler exclaimed. “ Is that all
the town you’ve got, and named for So-and-so,
too? Well, where’s your station?”

  The station-master waved his hand toward the
interior of the car.

  “ What! ” the traveler exclaimed again. “ Is
this all the station you’ve got?”

  At that the station-master removed his feet
from the telegraph-table, brought the front of his
chair down to the floor, and eyed the stranger
sternly.

  “.Now, look here,” he said, “ that’s all the town
we've got, and this here’s all the station we’ve
got, and we are named for So-and-so. ' But you
just bear this in mind, stranger, there’s a boom
on in this town ; that’s what! ”

  The commercial traveler’s hopes began to rise.
“ Oh, is that so? ” he asked.

  “ Yes, that's so! ” the other replied. “ Why,
even the railroad is onto it! They’re going to
give us a new station ! ”

  The traveler's interest increased. “You don’t
say! ” he said.

  “ That's what they^are! ” the station-master
proudly declared. “ They’re going to give us a
new freight-car «f 60,000 pounds capacity! ”

COURTESY IS CAPITAL STOCK.

DID you ever try to figure out the money-
value of courtesy? Has it ever occurred to
you that courtesy in business may be set down in
dollars and cents: that courtesy makes money
and that discourtesy loses it?

  Let us consider courtesy briefly as an asset, as
part of the capital stock of the company for which
you work. Of course, the question has its higher,
its ethical side, and we have dwelt upon this fre-
quently in this magazine; but here, and now, let
us make a practical application and see what
courtesy means as a business asset.

  Take an illustration: A man wishes to travel
from one city to another. The fare is ten dollars.
He may take his choice of two or more rail-
roads for the journey. He drops into the ticket-
office of one road, He finds a grouchy, tactless.

impatient, discourteous clerk behind the counter.
Owing to the manner of his reception, he deter-
mines to travel over another road. In the second
office, he is greeted cordially, is treated politely,
is made to feel that his business is desired, that
the clerk, as a representative of his company, is
glad to see him, glad to sell him a ticket, glad to
do all in his power to make the journey a pleasant
one.

  Is it not clear that in the first instance dis-
courtesy lost one company ten dollars, and that in
the second instance courtesy gained ten dollars
for another company? The ten dollars gained
goes to pay dividends and interest and wages and
running expenses. Courtesy, in this case, had a
distinct money-value; it could be set down on
paper in dollars and cents.—The Northwestern.
 NOT ON THE FLIMSY

 BY FRANK CONDON.

             A Discarded Item Which Failed To Show Why
             Walt Watson Lost His Courage and Vanished.

ALF a dozen editors skimmed
 over the sheet of A. P. flimsy,
 sneered inwardly, and, with
 the brief tightening of the
 lips that indicates editorial
 disgust, whisked the offend-
 ing sheet into the capacious jaws of the
 waste-paper basket.

 “Nobody hurt; nobody killed; nothing
smashed, and nothing happened! ” they said
indignantly. “And those idiots put such
trash on the wire for a real newspaper.”

  The cause:

                           Albion, March 9.

    Itinerant telegraph operator, working extra,
  failed hand over train-order, but retrieved
  negligence and prevented collision between two
  passenger-trains by trick of daring and
  strength early to-day before he disappeared.

    Train No. 2, west-bound and late, pulled
  out of Southwestern Railway station without
  the operator having delivered order to hold
  it for passing of east-bound train. Operator
  rushed along track, missed steps of last car
  and fell' headlong.

    Jumped up, and running caught rear, pulled
  himself onto vestibule-door, smashed glass and
  stopped train.

    Just enough time get back to Albion when
  east-bound train rushed by. Operator has
  not been seen since.

 Valuable space in modern newspapers
cannot be given over to such piffle. If the
operator had missed the rear car; if the

west-bound had plunged into the east-
bound; if there had been a list of dead a
column long as a broom handle, then,
sneered the editors—then it would be worth
the attention of the linotype men.

  At the moment the insulting news item
was being worded a man was sitting in the
rear of a barroom thirty miles from Albion,
with white linen bandages around his
bruised hands and a glass of fiery liquid be-
fore him—a rather grimy young man, with
the face of a very old man, and the shaking
fingers of one who has burned his fires too
rapidly.

  This was Walt Watson, and he was the
operator who had fled from Albion. If a
confession could have been worried from him
perhaps the “ story ” would have escaped the
paper-basket.

  Two comrades drifted into Buffalo during
the Pan-American Exposition. They drift-
ed out after the show had ended and the
walls were coming down, and simultaneously
they entered the service of the Southwestern
Railway. One of them was called Stock-
bridge and the other was Walt Watson.

  For a year they raced for advancement.

  Stockbridge was a marvelously good op-
erator, and in the course of time he began
to attract attention from headquarters. He
was as good an operator as Walt Watson.

  Stockbridge moved up a peg. Watson re-
mained where he was. Stockbridge knew
why.
202

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

   “ Walt,” he said one night, “ we’ve got to
separate. You and I have been living to-
gether since we left school, and I believe
we’re pretty fond of each other, so you’ll
forgive me if I say anything that hurts you.x
“I’ve been promoted one notch. You’d
have come right along with me if it hadn’t
been for one thing. You know what that
is. You're just a little bit too fond of the
stuff that has killed off better men than you
and me, and the company knows it. I’m
sorry, Walt, but there’s nothing I can do.
It’s a fight that each man has to fight him-
self—and his friend can’t help him.”

  “ I know all that, Stocky. Never mind
the preachments. What’s the immediate
cause of this W. C. T. U. meeting?” Walt
asked sullenly.

  “Just this,” Stockbridge replied. “The
Southwestern says I’ve got to give you up.
I’ve got to pack up my belongings and live
elsewhere. In other words, we’re not to
travel together from now on.”

  “ For your advancement,” sneered Wat-
son. “ Go ahead, then. There are no
strings whatever attached to you. Perhaps
I'll relish the change.”

  Stockbridge made no answer. He silently
got his things together and walked out.

   “ So-long, Walt,” he said, pausing in the
door. “ If you’ll take a friend’s advice,
you’ll cut out that stuff.”

   “It is a good thing,” Watson said lightly
—“ a good tiling for every man to mind his
own business. It’s really profitable.”

  That was the last Watson saw of Stock-
bridge for many months. He heard of him
frequently, and little by little there grew up
within him a feeling of resentment that
gradually turned to dislike, bitter and abi-
ding. Dislike gave way to hatred finally.

  There was a girl. Watson and Stock-
bridge met her in Buffalo, and liked her from
the beginning. They had bantered each oth-
er good-humoredly at first.

  “ I think I saw her first,” Stockbridge
laughed. You are hereby invited to attend
the wedding, Walt, and if you’re good you
may wear a waiter’s outfit and be our best
man. Grace would look amazing good as
Mrs. Joseph Stockbridge.”

   “ Your wires are crossed in nine places,”
Watson had answered. “ Grace and I will
be doing that little parade down the main
aisle, and you can stand in the vestibule and
hold the flowers.”

  Walton was almost right—almost! Grace
was fond of both men, but there was a pres-

sure to her handshake with Walt Watson
that Stockbridge had never'felt. Little by
little Walton forged ahead. He had kissed
the girl months before Stockbridge had ever
suspected, and when the little love-affair was
at its most prominent stage the smash came.

  The cause was the same that had brought
the frown of the Southwestern upon its
young operator. Walt called half a dozen
times on his sweetheart showing the effect
of liquor.

  The girl was shocked and disgusted.

  From that time on he played a losing
game. He was supplanted in Grace’s favor.
Stockbridge passed him in love as he had
passed him in business.

' “ He’s a cur,” Watson fumed. “ I’ll get
him for that.”

  Watson became lax in his work, and even-
tually the Southwestern dismissed him. He
secured new positions—and lost them. From
a clean-cut young chap he changed into a
shiftless, ill-clad loafer, and became untrust-
Worthy.

  Where he was known he could get no
work. By changing his name and traveling
he picked up a precarious living and secured
the funds to buy his cld enemy.

  Stockbridge forged ahead during the years
that followed. He married three years after
he separated from his- comrade, and the
bride’s name was Grace. Watson heard of
the wedding, and cursed them. Time, in-
stead of cooling his enmity for his former
chum, bolstered and increased it, and alco-
hol did the rest.

  In many a frenzy he promised Stockbridge
a speedy end if the two ever met.

  Then Watson drifted eastward by slow
stages. By changing his name repeatedly
he landed in brief-held positions. L^nknow-
ing, the Southwestern itself paid a frequent
wage to the operator who jumped from place
to place, and Watson smiled grimly when-
ever he noticed orders from the chief train-
despatcher’s office.

  They were always signed “ Stockbridge.’’

  “ He’s up and I’m down,” Watson reflect-
ed bitterly. “He cheated me and I’ll get
him for it.”

  He thought of a number of events that
had occurred in the years between their
friendship and the present. He remembered
the days when he had applied for work on a
dozen railroads, and of the mysterious in-
formation that had always filtered in be-
fore he secured the job. He had no ref-
erences, and reports about him invariably
NOT ON THE FLIMSY.

resulted in disaster. Once he had seen a
telegram lying on an office desk. It read:

     Sorry. Operator Watson unreliable. Bad
  record. Drinks.

                  Stockbridge, Southwestern.

  Far out in Wisconsin Watson had been
discharged, without cause. A prying and
envious coworker had interested in his past
the company employing Watson. Stock-
bridge had again been forced to tell the truth.
There were other matters, too.

  “Not only is he up,” Watson often mut-
tered, “ but he’s not satisfied to let me alone.
He’s kicked me farther down every time he
has had the chance.”

  By constantly nursing his animosity for
Stockbridge and indulging in virulent out-
bursts of rage, Watson kept his blood hot,
and the friendly feeling of the other South-
western men for the chief train-despatcher
only aggravated his resentment.

  He landed in Albion penniless and hun-
gry, and the friendly offices of the night op-
erator secured him a temporary berth at the
key.

  A husky storm was tuning up for the night
when the regular operator put on his coat.
Watson was huddled before the meager fire.

  “ Better watch the line pretty close to-
night,” said the former. “ There is a num-
ber of blocks, and Stockbridge is coming
down on No. 15 with Miles.”

  Watson sat up with a start.*
  “Stockbridge?” he asked.

  “ The chief,” replied the other. “ He’s
been doing this inspection stunt regular of
late.”

  “ Great,” Watson sneered. “ I suppose he
rides on velvet cushions in a Pullman private
car.”

  “ You’re wrong,” said the regular man re-
sentfully. “ He’s no snob. He rides with
Miles in the cab when he comes out on No.
15. He’s a mighty decent fellow, too.”
Watson walked about the diminutive room
when his companion had gone, looking over
the tawdry fixtures and listening to the
clicking of the key. He had borrowed a
small advance from the operator. Its result
was a brown flask that protruded from his
hip-pocket and that made frequent stimu-
lating trips to his mouth.

  “Stockbridge is coming on 15,” he
laughed bitterly. “He’d be surprised if he
could look in here when she goes by and see
his old friend at the key—the man he pushed
down and out.”

   Watson found a heavy wrench. He stared
at it a long time and ran his fingers over the
heavy steel knobs.

   “ I’d like to use this on him,” he growled.

  “ CK — CK — CK — CK — CK—”
chattered the instrument.

   Watson sank into his chair, and replied.

   His fingers had long failed before the
regular keys of a typewriter, and it was with
difficulty that he could use them at all. Ta-
king a rapid message on the machine was
beyond him, so he toiled laboriously with pen
and ink.

   Suddenly he looked up from his work and
stared at the pile of slips on the table. The
key clattered and clicked impatiently, but
Watson did not heed.

   He read the message over again.

   Hold No. 2, east-bound at Albion till No.

    15 passes.

   He looked out into the night. The sleet
had changed to a thick, feathery snow. He
glanced at the clock, and noted that it was
fifteen minutes of nine.

   No. 2 was due in Albion at nine o’clock.

  During the next ten minutes Watson
paced back and forth. The grudge of a half-
score years was working in his heated veins,
and he was pondering wildly on the revenge.

   In the cab of No. 15 Stockbridge was be-
ing hurled westward. No. 15 carried five
coaches and paused for nothing.

   East of Albion lay the worst curve on the
Southwestern system—a long, waving “ S ”
bend that shut out the track ahead.

   “ They’d never know! ” the operator mut-
tered hoarsely. “ He deserves it! He spiked
me! He ruined my life and kicked me down
farther than I was! He’s a cur, and he de-
serves it! ”

   Watson’s face had grown deathly white.

   Revenge was distorting his view, and the
fire of his steady hatred was being rapidly
fanned into blind, unreasoning fury and a
wild craving for revenge.

   Consequences mattered not at all. He saw
Stockbridge in the west-bound cab! He saw
the east-bound approach. He heard the
grinding of steel and wood, the roaring of
the released steam, and the passing of the
man who had ruined him!

   “He’ll get it—he’ll get it to-night!” he
whispered.

  The minute-hand was dragging upward
toward nine. Watson stood in the door fa-
cing the inrush of snow and peering toward
the west.
204

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

  The faint moan of the east-bound struck
him. A shiver ran down his body. The
pin-point of yellow light appeared, grow-
ing larger each moment. In another instant
No. 2 drew into Albion and slowed down.

  Watson waved the “ no order ” salute from
where'he stood. His blood boomed through
him and his head began to whirl. A pas-
senger alighted and hurried away.

  Watson turned and faced the east.

  Somewhere around the long turn No. 15
was gliding along through the feathery snow-
storm.

  The end was only a matter of moments.

  The operator stepped back into his room
and pulled on his coat. The order slipped
from his hand and fell to the floor, where
it lay shining in a ray of light from the
feeble lamp. Outside, the bell-cord hissed
its command. With a shriek of steam and
the jangle of the bell. No. 2 glided slowly
forward, for she had stopped on a slight
grade.

  The feeling about Watson’s throat tight-
ened. His eyes were glaring and his hands
were shaking so that he could scarcely lift
his ragged cap to his head.

  “ I’ve done it! ” he shouted.

  His voice was half a groan and half the
outburst of a maniac. Then he started to
the door. The tail-lights of No. 2 were
slowly swinging past him. He turned for a
last look into the dingy office, and as he did
so the glint of the fateful order, lying in

the glow of the lamp, struck him between
the eyes.

  A sudden revulsion ran through him, and
in another instant he was chattering with the
deadly fear of one condemned.

  His body grew cold, succeeding the wild,
throbbing heat of the preceding minutes.

  With a sudden snap, his tottering senses
slipped back into place, and his disordered
mind resumed the normal. He forgot every-
thing in the world except that train No. 2
was passing out of Albion and that train
No. 15 was rushing toward it.

  With a half-articulate yell, he turned and
started down the track in the wake of the
rumbling train. That’s all.

  Very clearly and succinctly the little
newspaper despatch tells the rest.

  Watson stumbled ahead, fell several times,
caught the rear of No. 2, and stopped the
train.

  He tumbled off into the snow and faded
away like a wraith. No. 15 shot by and into
the west—and the incident was ended.

  The next morning Stockbridge was ac-
quainted with the details. The regular op-
erator at Albion was dismissed before noon.

  “Who was the operator at the key?”
Stockbridge inquired of his assistant.

  “ Dunno,” that gentleman responded.
“ Somebody, but I don’t know who, said it
sounded like Clifford.”

  “ Clifford,” the chief repeated—“ Clif-
ford. Never heard of the man.”

THE TICKET AGENT’S DREAM.

AFTER standing behind the ticket-window at
Petoskey for three months, this is what
the ticket-agent dreams:

  “ Have you a lower for Fridav night for St.
Louis?”

  “No, madam; but we have some beautiful
uppers, with a colored elevator in connection.”

  “ I just can’t ride in an upper. Is there no
way you can get a lower for me?”

  “Not this season, madam; but we have under
■■construction for next season a car that will have
all the uppers built beneath the lowers, so there
will be no uppers.”

   “ Won’t that be lovely! ”

  " Yes. They will also have pipes connected
with and projecting out ahead of the engine, so
that the air you receive will be in no way related
to the air you get.”

   “ You don't tell me.”

  “ Yes. And when the sleepers are made up into
a solid train for the north it will be known as
* The Ozone Special.’ You’d better let me sell

you an upper; it beats walking. Besides, we will
furnish you with a beautiful yellow ticket which
just matches the elevator.”

  “ Do I have to transfer at Chicago? ”

  “ Yes, ma'am, if you are a somnambulist;
otherwise, you won't know that Chicago is on the
map.”

  “ I don’t know just what to do, I am so afraid
I can’t get into an upper.”

  “ We have a drawing-room for Cincinnati, if
you would care to go there.”

  “But I’m not going to Cincinnati; I’ve just
got to start for St. Louis, Friday night. I will
think it over and let you know later. Give me
a nickel’s worth of pennies, please. Does this
gum-machine work? ”

  “ Yes, ma’am; everybody it can.”

  “Well, I'm stopping at Waloon Lake; I’ll call
you up later and tell you what I decide to do.”
“Yes, please do; and if you decide not to go,
call us up and let us know at once, and tell us
why.”—Pcrc Marquette Monthly.
H ow the Free Riders Sleep

BY J. H. CRAIGE.

WHEN one thinks of the traveling hobo clinging by the “ skin of his teeth ”
to the trucks, the roof, or the brake-beams of an express train going
at the rate of sixty miles an hour and enjoying, at the same time, a
repose akin to that which he might find 011 a feather bed, the idea—well, it
just doesn’t seem to jibe, does it? To entice Morpheus under such conditions
seems about equal to playing a parley with sudden death, suicide, and fool-
hardiness written on the card.

    From Cape Cod to the Golden Gate the hobo journeys by night and sleeps
where most men would fear to travel in the light with their eyes wide open. On
the top of a car, clutching the grimy ventilator tubes with the grip of a vise,
curled up in the vestibule of the blind baggage, or wedged above the whirling
axles of the trucks—it is all the same to him.

     The astonishing part of it all is that he usually comes through alive.

The Peculiar Instinct That Permits a Rider of the Beam to Sleep Soundly
and in Safety When It Would Mean Instant Death
to Lose His Grip for a Moment.

IGHT is the hobo’s traveling
time. He insists on riding
a fast express. Securing a
time-table of the road on
which he wishes to travel, he
picks out the fastest night-
train, lies in hiding until she is ready to
pull out of the station where he is waiting,
and swings aboard her rear end, thus
dodging the railroad bulls, who always
hang about the front end of a train, watch-
ing the blind-baggage, where the inexperi-
enced tramps try to ride.

  Once aboard, he is safe until the next
stop, which in the case of an express-train
seldom takes place in less than an hour or
two. Even when a stop is made, perched
on the roof or on the trucks of the rear
car, the hobo is far from the lights of the
station where the forward cars stop, and
is practically sure of an undisturbed ride
as long as the darkness lasts. During the

eight or ten hours from dusk to dawn a
good traveler can easily put from three to
four hundred miles behind him.

  Unsoftened by springs and cushions, the
steady thud, thud, of a moving train has
a most decided soporific effect on the hu-
man frame. Add to this the effect of the
darkness, and the fact that the tramp on
the road seldom gets any repose in the day-
time, and you have a combination of cir-
cumstances which makes sleep during the
journey almost inevitable.

  It is only to be expected that death will
claim a heavy toll among these free riders.
Each year records from five to ten per cent
of their total number killed or injured, but
the survivors go on taking chances.

  One philosophic hobo, whose partner I
saw killed near Eugene, Oregon, last sum-
mer expressed the tramp’s view of the
matter very well. This was his comment
over the mangled remains:
206

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

  “Poor old Bill’s gone. We’ll miss him,
but it won’t make any difference to the
world. There’s plenty more where he
came from. Next.”

  Strangely enough, he was “next.” I
heard a few days later that he had been
ground to pieces under a Portland yard-
engine, an ignominious end for a veteran
blown - in - the - glass bo who had traveled
over the road since his boyhood.

  There are plenty more where he came
from. Railroad reports show that in the
neighborhood of ten thousand tramps are
killed or maimed every year. Of these,
perhaps fifty per cent are “good people,”
the title which the more expert professional
tramps apply to themselves.

  The other fifty per cent is made up of
“gay cats” or occasional tramps; men who
will work hard and regularly for a time,
but who are periodically forced to take to
the road, either because of labor conditions
or through the call of wanderlust.

“ Gay Cats ” Only Amateurs.

  Compared to the real tramp, the “ gay
cat” is a poor traveler. The drudgery of
habitual manual labor has either stiffened
his muscles or life indoors has dulled the
keenness of his animal senses, and left him
more a product of civilization and less a
primitive savage than his brother, the full-
fledged tramp.

  He is slow of hand, foot, and brain. His
perceptions are faulty. In the parlance of
the prize-ring, “his judgment of distance
is on the blink.” He is poorly fitted for
survival in the hostile and pitiless en-
vironment of life on the road, and accident
overtakes him at every turn.

  When he makes a flying dive for the
hand - rail of a moving train, he often
misses it and is thrown under the wheels.
His faulty instincts make him try to oc-
cupy most insecure positions, from which
he is jolted by the motion of the train.
Frequently, deserte'd by that guardian
spirit that seems to guide the feet of the
wayfarer, he steps from behind a train,
and meets his fate in the path of the ex-
press that is rushing down the next track.

  The professional tramp who is a good
traveler is a very different individual. Al-
though sgldom a powerful man, he is as
lithe, alert, and active as a panther; a
perfect type of the primitive cat-animal.
Since the passing of the Indian tracker,

there has been no type of man whose ani-
mal instincts and senses have been so per-
fectly developed. His judgment is seldom
faulty, his hand never falters, and his foot
never slips.

Death Claims Many -iims.

  Despite his greater fitness to survive,
however, as many “ good people ” are killed
and maimed on the road every year as
“gay cats,” and because of the smaller
number of regulars, the percentage of cas-
ualties among them is thus far greater than
it is among the “cats.” The'reason for
this is that under ordinary conditions the
“cat” travels by day on freight-trains,
where there is little temptation to sleep and
little danger to him if he does, while the
regular, adopting the habits of the feline
whose traits he possesses, travels by night
and sleeps in the daytime.

   The expert bo disapproves of local trains
and he has little use for freights, except
for an occasional nap in an empty box car,
if he happens to find one going in his di-
rection.

  Perhaps a natural conclusion would be
that the first time a hobo succumbed to
sleep in such places as he generally travels
there would be another gap in the ranks of
the tramp army, but here the subconscious
mind, that most discussed and least under-
stood of psychic phenomena, comes into
the case.

Feats of the Subconscious Mind.

  According to the best authorities, both
medical and psychological, the subconscious
mind lives at the back of the brain, just
over its near relatives, the mind centers
which govern the beating of the heart,
breathing, and other involuntary- functions
of the body.

  In the subconscious mind habits are
formed. It is by careful education of the
subconscious mind that the boxer acquires
the ability to perceive an opening and to
strike simultaneously. If he were com-
pelled to stop and think before hitting, his
opportunity would be lost, but he has
formed the habit, and the eye perceives and
the hand strikes without conscious mental
action on his part.

  The subconscious mind forms the con-
necting link between the conscious, reason-
ing mind, and the brain centers which gov-

ern involuntary action. The lower forms
of life have only the ganglia governing the
involuntary processes. In addition to this
the higher animals have also the power of
forming habits necessary to their preser-
vation.

  Man adds to these the ability to reason
and plan, but in the case of civilized man
the power of reason has so far removed
him from the exigencies of animal exist-
ence that he has lost through disuse the
subconscious alertness so prominent in the
make-up of the savage and the wild beast.

  By careful education and constant ex-
ertion of the will, the civilized man can ac-
quire to a certain extent the subconscious
alertness enjoyed by his savage ancestors.
It is by education of his subconscious mind
that the hobo acquires the facility of sleep-
ing in an insecure perch on a moving train
without suffering invariable and instant an-
nihilation. He does not acquire this fac-
ulty through design or by choice, but by
necessity and with fear and trembling, as
most other faculties necessary to existence
are acquired.

  Keeping a Grip While Sound Asleep.

  When a tramp begins to ride trains at
night, his constant fear is that he will fall
-asleep. Stretched out on the roof, or
crouched on the trucks, he sits shivering,
flexing his muscles, shaking his body as
much as his situation will permit, pinching
himself, and resorting to every possible ex-
pedient to keep awake, in deadly terror lest
sleep relax his grip and he fall to a speedy
and horrible death.

  Perhaps during his first few night-jour-
neys this terror is so intense that it over-
comes his fatigue and he stays awake, or
he sleeps so lightly that he does not know
that he has slept.

  During these journe/s the hours of in-
tense fear make a tremendous impression
upon his subconscious mind. Later he
happens to travel with an old-timer, and
sees the careless abandon with which the
veteran allows himself to sink into slumber.
Also he observes that nothing happens to
his comrade, and his terror lest sleep over-
take him is considerably abated. Still, the
fear education continues, although in a more
moderate form.

  Gradually his fears fade away and he
allows himself with less and less misgiv-
ings to doze and nod on his nightly rides,

until at last he reaches the stage where he
stretches himself out for a nap every time
he has a chance to make himself tolerably
comfortable on a moving train, with all the
carelessness of the veteran whose slumber
aroused his admiration in earlier days.

Change of Speed Dangerous.

  Then the education of his subconscious
mind is complete, and he is able to hold
down anything that turns a wheel, asleep or
awake, with a certain amount of security.
There are two psychological moments, how-
ever, during which it seems to be impos-
sible for the average man to educate his
subconsciousness to remain on guard.

  One of these is when the train on which
the tramp is traveling changes its pace or
motion, while the other is when the sleeper
awakes. Though we can educate the sub-
conscious mind to perform almost any regu-
lar series of simple movements or adapt
itself to almost any conditions, without the
guidance of the conscious mind, as soon as
the regularity is broken or the conditions
change the operations of the subconscious
mind cease.

  It is a peculiar fact that if a tramp falls
asleep on a train traveling at a rate of
thirty miles an hour, a change in speed to
sixty or to fifteen miles an hour will often
place him in serious danger. Either the
shock to his mental processes will be suffi-
cient to arouse him, or he will sink into
deeper slumber, in which nothing is more
probable than that some serious accident
will befall him.

  One of the most shocking accidents of
this kind that I have ever witnessed oc-
curred last summer near Battle Mountain,
Nevada. It was just before dawn, and a
great many tramps were riding the train,
making their way toward Reno, to the Jef-
fries-Johnson pugilistic battle which was
scheduled to take place in a few days. I
myself was riding a rear truck, and many
other tramps were strung along the whole
length of the train.

He Lost His Hold.

  The trucks on the Union and Southern
Pacific Pullmans were not designed to ac-
commodate a tall man with comfort. I was
far from sleep and was having a most mis-
erable time. As I turned over for about
the nineteenth time to get some of the
208

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

cramps out of my body, while I blessed the
trainmen who had made it necessary for us
to ride the trucks, the emergency brakes
suddenly screamed on, and our speed, which
had been previously about thirty miles an
hour, was cut down to almost a walk. A
few seconds later the brakes were released
and the train proceeded at its former speed.

  A short distance out of the town we struck
a curve, which jolted every one sharply to
the left. Instantly a series of ear-piercing
screams rose from under the car ahead.
Then they stopped and a red trail appeared
on the ties below.

  When we stopped, sOme one inside the
train who had heard the cries caused a
search to be instituted, and a bundle of
red rags was found tightly wrapped around
one of the car’s axles; all that was left of
a tramp who had been riding on the truck.
A blue-lipped, blood-spattered man who had
been riding the same truck was discovered
near-by, too weak from fright and horror to
crawl out from under the train.

A High Dive.

  According to his story, the two had been
traveling together, and were both asleep on
the truck when he had been awakened by
the jar of the emergency brakes. He was
composing himself for another nap, when
he noticed that his partner was reeling dan-
gerously in his seat.

  He was about to reach out to awaken him
when the train struck the curve, and top-
pling back, the sleeping man allowed his
coat to become wrapped about the revolving
axle.

  Despite his struggles and screams he was
unable to free himself, and was slowly
drawn into the whirlin'; mill. I heard
later in San Francisco that the survivor had
gone mad.

  When a man is very alert or the change
of pace or motion of the train he is riding
is very pronounced, he usually awakes. In
doing so he runs scarcely less risk than the
man who sleeps on, for the moment when
the alert subconscious sentinel is dismissed
and the drowsy sentinel of awakening con-
sciousness takes charge is one of great
danger.

  A man’s first impulse when aroused from
sleep is to stretch and yawn, and there are
times when these may bring the most dire
results. Some time ago, at North Platte,
Nebraska, a sudden awakening involved me

in a farce-comedy that might very easily
have been a tragedy.

  The train, on the roof of which I was
traveling, stopped suddenly and with quite
a jolt. The first thing I can recall is
awakening with a gulp from that terrible
race-old falling dream, and reaching out
frantically for something to stop my de-
scent. Then I lurched off the train and
began to fall in sure enough earnest.

  Luckily I lit on a truck piled with mail-
sacks awaiting an east-bound train and
was not hurt in the least. However, I came
within an ace of falling on one of North
Platte’s leading citizens. That gentleman
let out a bawl that would have done
credit to one of his own steers, and before
I had made up my mind as to whether I
was still dreaming, or had really had a fall,
one of the town constables appeared on the
scene and escorted me to the village lockup.
The next day, as my prosecutor did not ap-
pear, the same rural constable who had
arrested me escorted me back to the rail-
road and invited me to beat it.

  Another of the chief causes of disaster to
tramps is liquor. Night riding is almost
always cold, and often the tramp has no
more nerve than he needs, and resorts to
Dutch courage. Every railroader sees so
many near-accidents to drunken tramps,
that he is apt to wonder that there are not
more casualties than really take place.

  Almost all tramps who have the subcon-
scious faculties of the mind highly de-
veloped are men of strong will and indi-
viduality, whose mind and purpose are so
strong that it would seem that they rule
their actions even when asleep by sheer
force of character. However, I have seen
some startling exceptions to this rule.

Strange Case of Denver Joe.

  Perhaps the strangest case that ever came
under my notice was that of Denver Joe, a
child of the road whom I met in Winne-
mucca, Nevada.

  Like many road monikers, his title was
misleading. He was not from Denver at
all, but from Los Angeles. His age was
indeterminate. He looked sixteen, but was
probably much older.

  It was only a few days before the his-
toric pugilistic battle at Reno, a hundred
miles or more to the west, and the boes were
flocking over the road in such number that
the distracted railroad authorities in an en-
HOW THE FREE RIDERS SLEEP.

209

deavor to stem the tide were stationing
“ sapping parties ” of husky railroad
“ bulls ” and deputy “ bulls ” at every divi-
sion station, armed with clubs, arid with
instructions to “give it to the tramps good
and plenty,” after which they were to jail
the remains.

  Numerous tramps were hanging about the
town waiting to catch the first mail-train
out, which ran through at about eight
o’clock in the evening. I had seen several
of these constables, lurking about the sta-
tion with large business-like clubs, so I had
about decided that I did not want to catch
that early mail.

  There were a dozen fight specials coming
through that night anyway, and I knew that
the bulls would become sleepy before I
would. I tried to warn some of the tramps
whom I knew, but got a laugh for my
trouble, so, hunting up an unused feed-bin
on the side of the station overlooking the
track, I worked loose a board and climbed
in to await events.

  I had scarcely arranged things to my
liking when the board was pushed back
again and Denver Joe wiggled in, bringing
with him numerous hand-outs that he had
collected from the Winnemucca back doors.

  All he said was: “Help 'yourself to
whatever you want, partner, and wake me
up when you go.” Then he lay down and
was asleep in an instant. As he told it after-
ward, he had been traveling steadily for
two nights and a day, and had been kept so
busily on the move by the Winnemucca
bulls that he had gotten very little sleep
in the last forty-eight hours.

On the Observation-Car.

  While I was helping myself to such of
the hand-outs as I fancied, the eight
o'clock train came through, and I saw, with
a good deal of very heathenish delight, I
must admit, several of the gentlemen who
had scoffed at my advice get a thorough
taste of the sap-sticks.

  When the tumult and the shouting -died
I took a nap, and awoke somewhere near
midnight, as closely as I could tell by the
stars. It was cold and the station was de-
serted. A train was approaching. When it
stopped the last car was about even with
my feed-box.

  “Wake up, partner,” I called, and
reachcd over to shake my young friend, ex-
pecting to have considerable difficulty in

  ' 2 RR

waking him. To my surprise he rose im-
mediately, without a word and without signs
of weariness.

  “Come on,” I said, and we climbed out
of the box, went around to the far side of
the train, and climbed to the roof unnoticed.

  The coach on the rear end was an ob-
servation-car. Riding on its roof was hor-
ribly cold and disagreeable. I went back
to the rear end of the car and found that
I could climb down to the observation plat-
form. I went back and shook my friend.

  As before, he came without a word. We
climbed down, found some chairs and an
Indian blanket, and traveled all night quite
comfortably. In the morning we rode into
Sparks, the end of the division.

  We both slept through the greater part
of the journey and awoke at about the
same time, shortly after dawn. When my
companion had rubbed his eyes and looked
around, he asked with mild curiosity where
we were and how we got there, to which I
responded that he ought to know as much
about that as any one.

  He replied that he certainly did not
know where we were, and furthermore, that
he had not slept since he had left Ogden,
Utah, which by his computation was two
days and two nights before he had met me.
He did not seem to remember anything
since he had struck Winnemucca the morn-
ing before, except meeting the detective.

  He wound up with the assertion that the
S. P. was a mighty poor road to ride on, to
which I agreed, and once more demanded
to know how he had got where he was.

  When informed, he,took the matter very
philosophically, and told me that he had
always walked in his. sleep, and that when
he was little his mother could make him
do anything by speaking to him when he
was sleeping, from which one might infer
that that was the only time the old lady
could influence him in any way.

  We were separated going through the
snow-sheds on the road to San Francisco.
I was combed off by a State policeman at
the first stop, but he got through by crouch-
ing behind a dining-car ventilator. 'I sim-
ply went up to the head end and got into
a day coach, I secured a hat check and rode
through to Sacramento without question.
When we got there Joe was not on the roof,
and he did not show up in San Francisco,
though I waited at the Market Street de-
pot every day for over a week at the place
we had agreed upon.

Observations of a Country
Station-Agent.

BY J. E. SMITH.

No. 34—The By-Gone Combination of Telegraph Operator and Station-
Agent Who Was Paid for Overtime Only When There
Were Thirty-Two Days in a Month.

READ a tramp or vagrant article
the other day, on the old-time
country physician, and the old-
time country circuit-rider, pio-
neers of the Middle West, who
are no more and whose places
can never be taken, because there are newer
methods and newer manners and “ all things
change.”

  It brought to my mind the old-time com-
bination telegraph operator and station-
agent, who is likewise passing. He was
part of the same community as the doctor
and the circuit-rider. He filled his niche
and is fast being modified and modernized
by the newer order.

  I remember him as a busy, important
man in his community—a man harassed
and haunted by a multiplicity of detail,
fussy and arbitrary, but withal closer in
touch with the affairs of all the people
about him than either the doctor or the
preacher.

  On our line the station-agent is no longer
doing the railroad telegraphing.

  It is done in towers five miles apart, and
by three men on eight-hour shifts.

  On the same road twenty-five years ago,
there were telegraph offices only every ten
or fifteen miles, and the old station-agent
with a paralyzed arm and St. Vitus jerks
took the orders with one hand, billed out
freight with the other, held a mail-bag un-
der one arm, the express bills between his
teeth, and fastened the checks on the trunks
with his toes—all at the same time in one

hocus-pocus movement that was quicker
than the eye, and that would have aroused
the envy of the nimblest shell-and-pea
artist.

  On our road he is now only a memory.
His present-day prototype gives the move-
ment of trains no heed.

  The telegraphing has fallen to the man
in the tower, who does nothing else.

  The towers are furnace heated and built
of steel and cement. They are light and
airy and comfortable, but always located
at the edge of the town, or a little ways out
where passing tracks are possible.

  “ This is a pleasant place to work,” I as-
sured the first-trick man.

  “ Is it? ” he asked with a Missouri accent.

  “ Cheerful surroundings,” I added.

  “ So I am informed,” he answered with a
suspicious assent. “All the same, if you
had to rivet your gaze on the said surround-
ings eight hours even' day, three hundred
and sixty-five days in the year, for the rest
of your natural life, you wouldn’t enthuse
over it. You wouldn’t gush anv — you
wouldn’t slop over about it.

  “ Scenery is the commonest thing there
is to a tower job; but I never heard of an
operator wanting to stay with a tower job
on account of the landscape. I never heard
of one hating to leave because he could get
a good view of a Turner sunset, or feast
his eyes on a Rosa Bonheur flock of grazers.
Did you?”

  “ Anyway,” I persisted, “ you haven’t
anything else to do but telegraph.”

“But you only work eight hours.”

  “ Add another hour or so getting to it,

us?” lie said. “This: Whenever little
Willie’s legs grow weary, other pedestrians
are eager and waiting.”

  I tried the second-trick operator.

  “ An operator has a pretty flossy job these
days compared to twenty-five years ago,”
I ventured, as an introductory observation.

  “Huh? He has! Any one who thinks
a tower job’s a snap ought to be led to it.
What do them brakemen get? Anywhere

where or see anybody. Hasn’t any after-
noons or evenings to himself.”

  With this melancholy reflection, lie tilted
a dinky cap back into an ambush of riotous
hair, adjusted his balloon pants so as not
to impair the crease, and slid down in his
chair. Then he fished up a harmonica
and played, with fiendish vigor, “Turkey
in the Straw,” adding the “Virginia Skee-
daddle ” for extra measure.

  The next number on the evening program
was a song with both guitar and catarrh
accompaniment. It was a sad song as I
remember it, about a maiden fair, and I
think she had hair; eyes, too, if I am not
mistaken. She was waiting for him some-
where, in the agony of despair, with heart-
strings to tear, but with a devotion that
would wear, with a love nothing could im-

pair; whereupon I slid out. It was too
pathetic.

  “ You have a pretty nice job, haven’t
you?” I asked of the third-trick man.
“ Only eight hours in this fancy tower, and
nothing else.”

  “’S’nough!” interposed the third-trick
man, poising a halting hand. “ Some one’s
been stringing you. Some night when the
wind or the rain or the snow or the sleet
is cutting high jinks, it’s worth a day’s
labor to get out here, to say nothing of the
eight hours and the return trip.

  “ Say, when a man goes to work at eleven
o’clock at night and quits at seven ..in- the
morning, he’s got to sleep the rest of the
day, ain't he? He’s got to commence hot-
footing along about ten to appear at eleven.
Where does he get any time? When you
say 1 nice ’ you got the wrong word. Try
it again! There’s a pocket Webster in the
second drawer. Might as well work all
night, as to have to poke out about nine-
thirty or ten.

  “The only eight-hour snap for any man
is from eight to four, daylight. Blocking
trains is particular work, and when you’re
here, you’re here. Don’t forget that. You
haven’t a minute for anywhere else. You
never see any one, and it’s lonesome work;
with only a block wire and the despatcher’s
wire, we can’t even hear anything of inter-
est. You can’t tell us we are better off than
our grandfathers. Tell it to Sweeney! ”
“What’s the chances of promotion?” I
asked all three of them.

  Chorus:

  “None. From third trick to second, to
first. Once a tower operator, always a
tower operator! ”

  “ Anyway, it’s nice and quiet, and you
haven’t the public to annoy you.”

  Chorus:

  “That’s it, solitude! It’s deadly lone-
some! Come on, oh, you populace! Wel-
come to our midst, oh, you rabble! ”

   Now, I can assure the tower operator that
the pioneer operator of a generation ago was
not so keen for the association of his fellow
man. Fact is, he did not have much else.

  Taking train orders and noting the move-
ment of trains was only incidental to him.

  He was either station-agent or firsT aid
to the agent wherever located. Usually he
was the whole works. He was hung with
titles and marks of eminence like an Oriental
prince. He was station-agent for the A.
and Z. Railway, agent for the Jeffersonian

was then an in-
fant on the bottle
or a truant
schoolboy.

  The modern institutions of learning
wherein a healthy lad comes in fresh blown
from the farm and hands over ma’s butter-
money for a course in telegraphy, and gets
in return a scroll worded in five colors, a
Latin phrase, and a personal eulogy signed
by six grave aid learned professors and
titled examiners, had not then been evolved.

  When a boy wanted to learn telegraph-
ing he hung around the depot until the
agent put him to sweeping out, toting the
mail-cars, and lugging in the coal.

  After a year or more, he was ready for
a job. He went to it eagerly, unadorned
with pants that flapped like a sail," unor-
namented with a dinky cap, and unembel-
lished with a flowing necktie of seven col-
ors. But he knew about what to do when
he landed. He knew how to handle a coal-
dust fire so the stove would not blow up.
He knew how to truck freight and heave
sample trunks, bill out freight, and keep
the office accounts.

  To-day, lie is conducting the railroad
company’s business at the important points.
Hard knocks made him fit.

  In the elite and luxuriant present it is
from the perambulator to the hammock, to
cushions, to the padded-leather office chair,
while in the long-departed days the route
lay via the coal-hod and the two - wheel
truck.

  The old-time telegraph-office-w Jhe depot
lifted many a town to a boasted eminence
over surrounding towns. It was the stand-

ard recognition of impor-
tance, and they were only
here and there. It was an
outlook upon the world. It
was the means of quick com-
munication with all other important centers.

  The man at the depot who could sit at
the desk in a din of clicks—there were
usually two wires, one railroad and one
commercial—and out of the confusion of
noises could reduce a message to writing
that any one could read with the help of
the school-teacher and the postmaster, was
looked upon with awe and respect as one
marvelously endowed.

  There were no telephones. That miracle
came later.

  There were but few daily papers and
they were five cents straight, preaching the
party doctrine the same way. The people
were rampantly partizan. Elections were
of the knock-down and drag-out variety,
where every man was voted—the stripling
youth, the senile aged, the half dead, the
lame, the blind, and the halt.

  I think every old operator will recall
election nights at the country depot crowded
with patriots from all around to get the
returns.

  The waiting-room and office were stuffy
and heavy with the breath of politics, and
the old oil-lamps burned with a sickly red
from a starvation supply of oxygen.

  The old political wheel-horses and bell-
wethers hung close over the operator, the
216

snort of battle still in their nostrils, and the
scent of warfare on their breaths.

  Then came a portentous “Hist!” while
the operator bent low over hi's instrument,
followed by the suppressed exclamation,
“It’s coming.”

  The operator traced something across the
clip—a strange chirography like unto Chi-
nese or Timbuctoo—but he translated it to
those about him, whereupon a boiler-voiced
patriot proceeded to enlighten the throng
by reading aloud with impressive orator-
ical effect.

  “ Montpelier, Vermont.—Early returns
indicate that Vermont has gone Republican
by the—”

   A yell of triumph drowned the rest of it.

  He raises a silencing hand.

   “ Hure’s a nother’n.”

  “Jefferson, Mississippi.—Early indica-
tions are that Mississippi has gone Demo-
cratic by the—”

  Triumphant yell No. 2 anwered yell No.
1, quite equal in volume and intensity, and
honors seemed even.

  At 10 p.m. he sent a message to the
State capital notifying a waiting world that
Liberty Township had gone Democratic
by 23.

  Then came some scattering returns from
New York State, and the leaders figured
and speculated, “ If we come down to Har-
lem River with so much, we’ll carrv New
York.”

  The dispute and argument raged over the
operator’s head, until there was a sort of
nebulous conclusion that somewhere on the
line of the Harlem River an irresistible
force was about to meet an immovable body
with the usual scientific result, and his
majesty take the hindermost.

  Along about three or four in the morn-
ing the crowd thinned to a remnant, and
the operator, with spent vitality, announced
“No more to-night.”

  Then he blew out the lights and stag-
gered for the outside and gulped in the
pure night air like a famishing creature.

  An American citizen, heavily burdened
and fearful for the fate of the Republic,
followed him for confidential information.
He had yelled long and lustily. He thought
the operator might know more than had
been read aloud.

  “Do you think we’re beat?” he asked in
smothered, confidential tones.

   “Looks like it,” grunted the operator.

  “Ain’t that tough? I’d ruther lose a

hundred dollars, I tell you, ’an have ’em
beat us.”

  He turned back, and the gloom of the
night swallowed him up. ~ s'

   Note that fine American sentiment. Note
that spirit of sacrifice. Note that unfal-
tering devotion.

  That same fellow had remained perched
upon a fence all the afternoon receiving
alternate deputations of workers from both
parties, and was not “persuaded” until
late in the evening, when he went up, per-
sonally conducted between two wheel-
horses, and voted. He remained for the
returns with the old operator to the last
minute, and feared the worst.

  Viewed commercially, getting the news
for the people netted the old operator just
two dollars. The sovereign citizen got no
more for the part he played. Two dollars
in this far-away day was a lump sum, and
people had to have the telegrapher’s serv-
ices' or remain in darkness.

   The old operator had no levers to throw.
If he got an order for a train he went out
and hung up a red flag. If he was occu-
pied at the moment with other duties he
could easily forget it. Of course, the in-
structions were to put out the flag immedi-
ately on receipt of the train order, and
there were specific rules to that effect; but
a busy man in all ages of the world will
postpone incidental details from time to
time and in the end forget.

   Usually as the engine whistled for the
station or came thundering by, he would
remember the order and make a wild dash
for the flag. This, as a rule, got the con-
ductor. As the engineer did not sign the
order or have it read to him, but had only
an impersonal interest in it, the conductor
was all that was necessary, anyway.

  Now and then, the train got away en-
tirely, but so long as nothing happened,
and as there were no State or inter-State
commissions to meddle, it wasn’t such a
serious matter.

   After a time, some genius conceived the
idea of having a tin wing-signal attached
to the building outside and turned from
inside the office By a lever, a rope, or a
pulley, and save the operator from under-
mining his constitution by exposing him-
self to the elements without while hanging
up a train-order flag.

   This raised the mortality rate among op-
erators, and placed them in the insurable
class.
OBSERVATIONS OF A COUNTRY STATION-AGENT.	217

  Great forward strides were made about
this time. It was found that if a bay
window was put in the telegraph-office an
operator could see a train coming some dis-
tance away. Simple idea, isn’t it? Never-
theless, -the early depots were as fiat as the
first school-house or the pioneer church,
and were planted within about six feet of
the rail, so that the passengers on and off

  The old operator resented the invasion,
opposed the onward march, and showed his
opposition by just tying the new apparatus
down, giving everything a clear track, and
went ahead expensing, booking, way-bill-
ing, and blundering as before. Discipline
finally broke him of the string habit.

  We are now back to both the old and
the new.

were jammed into one unmanageable and
immovable mass and more or less endan-
gered whenever a train came in. Some of
these buildings remain in service to the
present day.

  The world continued to move, for very
soon another signal sharp conceived the
idea that if the train-order signal showed
red all the time and. the voluntary act of
the operator was required to show white
and permit a train to pass without stop-
ping, there could be no failure on the part
of the telegrapher. Negligence and forget-
fulness would stop the train, thus reversing
previous conditions.

  We use the semaphore, and we also hang
out the little red flag.

  In this day of the block and tower, the
train-order has been reduced to a scientific
brevity, thus:

  “No. 32 meet No. 41 at BJ tower.”

  A generation ago the trains were min-
utely described by thumb-print measure-
ments, and were then formally ordered to
“meet and pass at Grimes Siding.”

  Get the thought. If only the word
“meet” had been employed, two trains
would have stood at Grimes Siding nose to
nose in a technical deadlock. Having
“met,” no provision was indicated for fur-
218

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

ther movement. By adding, “and pass,”
it was at once clear that one train should
go by the other.

  Do not smile, please. This is a mighty
serious article. It was a good many years
before the word “ meet ” was officially made
and finally understood by all to mean
“pass.”

  Fine point that. Shows how a railroad
by education and perseverance can put one
over on Noah Webster.

  The old-time side-wheel operator whose
sending was like the water from a jug,
would commence repeating a train - order
sitting down. He would gradually come
upright, however, until he was on his tip-
toes and bending over the table. He would
hit the word “pass” with fifty dots, and
would fall over in a dead lump on the dash
in “a,” and call up the reserves for the
concluding dots in the two “ s’s.” When
it came to hurdling the word “pass” the
awkward “mitt” made it a prolonged, ag-
onizing, acrobatic feat.

  It was absolutely necessary to eliminate
it to save laying out the trains.

  Then there were the happy holidays for
the old operator, when every one went some-
where, when all the trains were late, when
every one was getting a package or sending
one away, when he was overwhelmed with
a beseeching, complaining, expostulating
public, until he blasphemed Santa Claus.

  But with all this there were happy mo-
ments, for at regular intervals he would
receive a “ death message ” for some one
in the country or in a near-by town, and
with an office message to deliver by special
messenger. There were no telephones.
Thereupon the old operator would sublet
the delivery contract, or hold the message
until night and go himself, and clear two
dollars and fifty cents through the special
delivery service which, while of doubtful
promptness, always came high.

  That source of revenue has been elim-
inated. The telephone has woven its web
to every man’s door, and the “death mes-
sage” is phoned. All that comes back is,
“ Thank you.”

  When there was no night office, the old
operator was considered always on duty.

  If a train crept into his station in the
night, and got on a siding and could not
see the headlight of the train it was to
meet, some member of the crew would go
prowling about the village to rout out the
operator. Any hour of the night he was

subject to the call of the stranded con-
ductor. He had no hours. He got no extra
pay. The only “overtime” that came his
way was when there happened to be thirty-
two days in the month.

  If any one had told that the day would
come when nine hours would -be made the
legal limit of one day’s labor for the rail-
road operator, he would have poohpoohed,
taken to his prayers, and figured on the end
of the world.

  Then, again, there was the public, the
great public—always on duty, always in-
sistent.

  Many a night the old operator, faithful
and accommodating, has laid his head on
his pillow to be rudely awakened after the
first hour’s deep sleep by a vigorous thump-
ing on the front door.

   He collects his drowsy senses, is annoyed*
but not alarmed, and answers from the sec-
ondrstory window.

  “Bill Jones wants you to come to the
depot, right away! ” comes the voice from
below.

  “ What does he want ? ”

  “I dunno. He says it’s important!”

  “Anvbody dead ? ”

  “Nope.”

  “ Think he’s lookin’ for something or
somebody ? ”

  “I dunno. He says for you to come
right over. He’s waitin’ there for you.”

   “ All right, tell him to wait. I'll be over
after a while.”

  Then the old operator, with a little of
the spirit of human cussedness and resent-
ment still surviving within him, turns over
and falls into a deeper sleep than ever,
while Bill Jones shifts around on a hard,
unfriendly truck, blinking at the dog-star,
seeing the moon slip behind the great be-
yond, and, at length, slinking away after
a prolonged session, with meanness in his
heart and maledictions on the head of the
railroad man that had no accommodation
about him.

  Nevertheless, the old operator answered
the night call many times for mower parts,
binder repairs, and catalogues, for the
farmer comes into the country village only
after he has done his sixteen hours on the
farm, and he is not backward about calling
any one out to serve him. The merchant
and blacksmith answer the call with cheer-
ful servitude, for they need his patronage.
The old operator was the first to rebel. He
was the pioneer who bowled out the slogan,

“There’s a time for work and a time for
play.”

  Time works changes. The old order
passes away. One day the store-clerk came
over with a package of collars and cuffs
and expressed them to Troy, New York.
When they came back they were whiter and
more shiny than the finest china, and they
were exhibited in the store window as a

ance where two people can be a mile apart
and talk to each other and hear just the

he would have to see and hear one of
them for himself before he would believe

“ I allow it will take the place of telegraph-

  “ So would perpetual motion be lots more

subtle defense of the old order of which he
was a trained part, and showing suspicion
and distrust of any departure therefrom.

  One day a new man breezed in from
Chicago.

  “ I’ll tell you what I saw,” said he. “ I

saw a fellow in ‘ Ch ’ office take a message
right off the wire on a typewriter machine
and never break. And there it was just
like print. That’s telegraphing for you,
ain’t it? ”

  “Huh,” answered the old operator.
“There was some trick to that. I’ll never
believe they’ll get to printing them right
off the wire on machinery until I see ’em
do it.”

  The postmaster came over.

  “What’s this I see in the papers,” he
asked, “about the railroads dividing up
these United States into Eastern time, Cen-
tral time, Rocky Mountain time, and Pa-
cific time? Ain’t President Hayes got eny-
thing to say how this country ought to be
divided up?”

  As a commissioned servant of the U. S.
A., he was riled.

  The old operator could not explain it.

  “We’ve always run by Columbus time,”
he explained, “ but I understand it’s going
to be St. Louis time, and the time’s going
to be divided into four parts, with an hour
between ’em. Every road has its own time.
I understand they are going to be made
all the same.”

  “ Air the railroads going to have the
sun rise and set as usual, or air they goin’
to change that ? ” asked the postmaster
with sarcasm.

  “ I reckon they'll do about as they durn
please with their own clocks, won’t they?”
replied the old operator.

  That was long, long ago. The old op-
erator has gone to his reward. Tears and
flowers.

  The depot where he battled with the pub-
lic has crumbled to dust, and a new sta-
tion, porte cochered and minareted, stands
in its place.

  Away down the track is a tower where
the three operators on eight - hour shifts
handle the movement of trains with never
a jarring note from the public.

  The village has its white houses, its
graceful trees, its bricked streets, and its
happy children.

  It is the second-trick operator of the
newer order.

  A farmer slips up between breaths in his
touring-car for the binder parts. The agent
has notified him by phone that they had

  It is all so different—so much better.
Pity the old operator could not have lapped
over into the next generation.

SUPERHEATING NOT A NEW IDEA.

THE superheater is of necessity coming to the
front with rapid strides, chiefly owing to the
urgent needs and calls from every quarter for
fuel Economy. Superheating is not a new-fan-
gled idea, as some persons suppose, the opinion of
some being that the superheater on a locomotive
is something that has been imagined in the mind
of some enthusiast on fuel economy, and is con-
sequently additional apparatus with which to fill
up the already crowded front-end of a locomo-
tive, and which will result in nothing. Super-
heating is not by any means a new idea, though
at present it is being put to uses that were un-
heard of years ago.

  Ever since the laws of expansion and con-
traction have become recognized, superheating,
both of solids and gases, has been practised with
a definite purpose in view, viz., to gain a greater
efficiency out of the substance being heated than
could have been obtained by any other means.

  There are two or three known laws that govern
the working of the superheater on a steam-en-
gine. From one of these, called Mariotte’s law,

it is found that the density of a gas increases as
the pressure increases, and decreases as the volume
increases. From another, known as Gay-Lus-
sac’s law, we learn that if the pressure remains
constant every increase of temperature oj one
degree F. produces in a given quantity of gas an
expansion of 1.492 of its volume at 32 degrees F.

  Now the principle of this should be very easy
for a fireman to understand, in that every degree
of superheat produces an expansion of the steam,
which results either in greater pressure, if the
volume is constant, or in greater volume if the
pressure remains constant. The steam generated
in a locomotive-boiler is called saturated steam,
and in fact steam in any boiler is in the same con-
dition, saturated; that is to say, it has a certain
amount of moisture with the steam. This is due
to the bubbles of steam coming up through the
water being surrounded by a thin film of water,
and this thin film naturally causes an amount of
water to become mixed with the steam; thus it is
called saturated steam.—Locomotive Firemen and
Engine men’s Magazine.

CHAPTER XXII.

When Greek Meets Greek.

Til WATERS cantered down the
pike astride of the brown horse,
comfortably seated in the sad-
dle, urging him on with the long
reins of the bridle. He smiled
complacently as the horse broke
into an easy lope. He smiled,
because it was pretty good work to make a
getaway, not only with a horse, but with a
saddle and bridle as well.

  In the darkness he did not know where
he was going. It lacked a few hours of
dawn, but the horse seemed to know the
road, and Seth let him have his way.

  He seemed to be a good roadster, and he
kept up the same easy, steady lope. Once
or twice Seth was inclined to let him out,
but he thought it best not to do any hard
riding just then.

  When the day dawned he might possibly-
run the risk of sheriffs—then he could let
the brown horse show what was in him in
the way of speed.

  As he cantered along he smiled in satis-
faction at the marvelous manner in which
he had made his escape. In the first place,
fooling the farmer was a ten-strike. Killing
the dog so deftly before it had a chance to
bark was, surely, the work of a master.
Annexing the overalls and the bread, to say
nothing of a good horse with a saddle and
bridle, placed him beyond all peradventure
in the front rank of the nimble-fingered
gentry who steal for a pastime.

  Seth was more, than proud of himself.
Having met with such unusual success
since his hastened departure from Rosalia,

   lie now thought that it would be an easy
   matter to get just what he wanted, and at
   any time.

     Food and transportation were to be his
   for the asking. Should the man whom he
   might ask deny him—then that man would
   have to pay the penalty.

    Mile after mile of roadway the brown
  horse covered before the first stars began to
  fade and the gray of a new day appear on
  the horizon. When the dawn finally burst
  so that Seth could see the country around
  him, the horse had slowed down to a walk.

     He was approaching a canon. He could
  tell from the high hills that surrounded
  him that its entrance was not far off. As
  the day grew brighter he took in his new
  surroundings with a whimsical leer on his
  face.

     Truly luck was playing right into his
  hands.

     The horse walked on and on. Seth did
  riot urge him. He would ride into the
  canon, find a secluded spot, and camp out
  for a day or two. He had the two loaves
  of sour bread with him; and then a canon
  always indicated water. Things were com-
  ing his way.

     In his heart, Seth loved the wilderness,
   and he loved to be alone. Eating, with
   him, was only a means to an end. If there
   was a slim chance of getting food—only the
   merest chance — Seth was satisfied. He
   liked to be alone.

     Alone with a horse or a dog, or the birds
   that caroled in the gay foliage of the Cali-
   fornia wonderland—it was all the same to
   him. On the gray days when it rained he
   was satisfied to curl himself up under a
   sheltering rock—if that were the only thing
   handy.

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

  If it were a matter of talking, he would
talk aloud to himself, or to his horse or
dog. He only asked and prayed to be alone
—alone in the mighty world, unmolested,
free—at will to mount his horse or call his
dog, and go whither hisMancy directed.

  So long as this condition lasted, Seth
knew that he was safe, and so we gather
diat his desire for the lonesome life was
more to satisfy his criminal instincts than
to commune with nature. When he picked
out a little white spot just beside a faintly
running stream about a mile or so inside the
canon, he was fully satisfied that he was
never so much alone in all his life.

  The spot that he selected was surrounded
by a growth of giant sequoia, and the
chaparral at its base was thick and home-
like. It looked as if no other man had ever
looked on it before. The very air he was
breadiing seemed disturbed at the presence
of a human being.

  The road that he followed into the new
paradise showed the traces of traffic. The
wide-tired wheels of the big, covered
schooners, and the long, narrow hoof-prints
of the patient mules, told him that it had
been traversed—but it was evident that he
was the first man who had come to stay.

  He had some trouble in reaching the white
spot. The underbrush was thick and almost
impenetrable. The horse got one or two
pretty bad scratches. One of them bled
profusely. This worried Seth more than
anything else just at that moment.

  He tethered the animal under a tree, where
it would be hidden from the passing mul-
titude should any part of it happen along
die roadway. Removing the saddle and
bridle, he filled his hat from the stream,
washed the horse’s wounds carefully, and,
tearing the stolen overalls in strips, he
bound the wound that bled.

  He bound it tightly, first applying a poul-
tice of mud from die bed of the stream, and
was soon gratified when the bleeding had
perceptibly ceased. He watched it for some
time until it stopped altogether. Then, sat-
isfied that his surgical work was well "done
and had taken effect, he stretched himself
on the soft grass and went to sleep.

  When Seth aWoke he sat up rather hur-
riedly, and, naturally, looked at his horse.
The animal was just where he had tethered
it but, strangely, it was looking straight
ahead, its ears bent forward.

  “ AnoUier one of those durned panthers,”
meditated Seth.

  The horse, realizing that Seth was awake,
neighed in a subdued sort of a way, but all
the time it kept looking steadily ahead.
Seth arose and stood by the animal’s head.

  He peered into die bushes ahead—and
saw a man.

  .The stranger was a small, wiry man,
dressed in a somewhat dilapidated suit of
clothes. His blue shirt was open at the
neck, and his sombrero was pulled down
over his eyes. Seth would have made two
of him, and could have kicked him into the
middle of next week.

  Seth would have gladly imparted this
information to the stranger and then carried
it into effect—but the stranger was armed.

  His foot rested on a fallen stump; his
elbow rested on his knee; his finger rested

011	the trigger of a shining rifle, and his
eye rested on Seth.

  “Up!” said the stranger in a voice that
was unusually high-keyed..

  Seth raised his hands over his head
rather cumbersomely, saving as he did:

  “ I ain’t armed.”’

  “Turn around,” said the stranger.

  Seth turned, his hands still above his
head.

  The stranger, convinced diat Seth had
nothin" in his hip-pockets, ordered him to
step forward.

  Seth did as he was ordered. He walked
to within two feet of the other and
stopped.

  The stranger prodded Seth's wearing ap-
parel with the barrel-end of his rifle, all the
time keeping his finger on the trigger, while
Seth kept his hands in the air. Then he
knocked off Seth’s hat, pried around his
much worn shoes, and went through a few
other gyrations until he was absolutely cer-
tain that Seth was telling the truth.

  “All right; put ’em down,” said the
stranger.	,

  Sedi let his long anus drop to his side
and picked up his hat. The stranger step-
ped over die log, and slung his rifle over his
shoulder as he did so.

  “ I don’t mind meeting you, stranger,’’
said Sedi; "but if you will tell how on
eardi you found me here, I will deeply
appreciate it.”

  “ Heard ye snorin’,” replied the litde
man.

  “Snoring!” remarked Sedi.

  “Yes”—and just the faintest glimmer
of a smile crept over the little fellow’s face
—“you was a tearin’ it off at some speed.”
IN THE HORNET’S NEST.

223

 “You don’t say.”

 Seth was somewhat surprised at his own
 carelessness. He should have waited until
 night before going to sleep.

 “ Had a long ride ? ” asked the stranger.
 “ Fairly long.”

 “Where from?”

 Seth paused before he answered:

 “Over there.”

 He gave a nod with his head, and the
 stranger could have taken any direction that
 pleased his fancy — north, east, south, or
 west.

 “That road only leads in one direction,”
 said the armed man.

 “ I know that,” replied Seth.

 The crafty Seth didn’t know. He didn't
 know just-jvhere on top of the great, wide
 world he really was; but, whatever the mis-
 sion or motive of the armed man, Seth was
 not going to divulge even an inkling of his
 ignorance.

 “It leads to Santa Maria,” went on the
 stranger.

 Santa Maria! A town about thirty miles
 to the north of Rosalia.

 Seth took it all in without blinking an
 eye.

 Santa Maria! The road led to Santa
 Maria! Then he had been traveling in a
 sort of a circle, and was not so far away
 from Rosalia as he had expected.

 This information meant a great deal to
 him. It meant, perhaps, his life—but so
 calm remained the muscles of his face that
 the stranger discerned nothing of the whirl-
 ing thoughts in his mind.

 “ Fine horse you’ve got.”

 The stranger approached the animal and
 stroked his back. The horse was no longer
 nervous. He realized that the stranger was
 a friend.

 “Where did you get him? ”

 Seth did not answer quite as readily as
 a highwayman of his ability should. He
 hesitated just long enough to give his visitor
 an idea that all was not just what it should
 be, and then replied:

 “ I've always had him.”

 The last word had hardly been uttered
 when the stranger said:

 “No, you ain’t; you stole him!”

 Seth had to accept the insult, bitter and
 truthful as it was; he was unarmed.

 “Can’t get in an argument with me,”
 said Seth.

 “ Ain’t no argyment needed long as ye
 tell the truth,” said die little man.

  Some philosophy in that, thought Seth.
Comes pretty near hitting the bull’s-eye.

  “ He’s a pretty good animal,” the stran-
ger continued, walking around the horse
and eying him critically. “ I should say
that he was somethin’ on the road. Bet
he'll make some distance ’tween sunrise
and sunset.”

  Then it dawned on Seth that the stranger
wanted his horse.

CHAPTER XXIII.
A Deal in the Wilderness.

“T AIN’T got the slightest idea in my nut,”
the stranger continued, “that this
horse is yourn. I’m pretty certain thet you
stole him.”

  “ Suppose I did—if it will please you
any,” said Seth.

   “ It will give me less feelin’s ’bout takin’
him.”

  “That so?” Seth looked at his man
quizzically.

   “ Thet’s so,” said the .stranger, raising
his voice, and smiling as if to indicate that
he held four aces and all the trumps in the
little game that he was playing.

  He was still walking around the animal,
which was now grazing quietly, looking at
it with keen eyes.

  “ Don’t seem to have no brand on him,”
said the stranger.

  “Never noticed any,” Seth replied.
“Guess you’re pretty good at the game,
pard. Never knew a good horse-thief yet
as would take one with a brand, if he
could help it.”

  That almost pierced Seth’s diplomacy.
It was all he could do to keep from land-
ing on Eis strange companion, regardless of
the consequences.

  “ He was that way when I bought him,”
Seth said, as soon as he could smother the
anger that was dwarfing his better self.

  “ Ha! ha! ha! ” The stranger laughed.
“ Say, bo,” he went on, “ don’t come any of
that fool talk with me. You stole that
horse, and you know it. I ain’t been around
these parts not to know a stolen plug when
I sees one. I’ll bet I could get on his back
now, and he would take me straight to the
barn where you found him.”

  “Well, supposing I did,” said Seth with
determination. The stranger being so in-
tent on the point, Seth thought it best to
take another tack.
224

THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.

  “It’s all the same to me, even if you do
confess.”

  “What do you mean by that?”

  “ I mean to take him! ”

  “You mean to what?”

   Seth stepped closer to the stranger as he
uttered those words.

  “Just what I said,” the little man re-
marked with a coolness that made Seth
Waters wince. “ I mean to take him. I
need that horse in my business. Come,
now! Look lively! I ain’t got no time to
waste! Put that there saddle an’ bridle on
him, quick! I want to get out of here.”
Seth hesitated.

  The stranger made a motion with his
rifle. He indicated clearly that business
was his bent.

  Seth picked up the saddle and slung it
on the horse’s back. He worked slowly;
but he was thinking all the time..

  He needed time to think. He wasn’t go-
ing to let this man get away with the game.

   Just as he was about to put the bridle in
the animal’s mouth, he turned to the stran-
ger and said:

  “Look here, pard, you ain't going to
leave me here—”

  “ Get that bridle on—quick! ” said the
other as he slung his rifle to his armpit.

  It was evident that sentiment would have
no effect on this man. Seth adjusted the
bridle, buckled the throat-latch, and threw
the reins over the saddle-horn. Then he
turned to await further orders.

  “ Stand ten feet in front of him! ” the
bandit commanded.

  Seth measured the distance and came to
a halt.	/ .

  The other man walked to the horse, un-
tied the rope by which Seth Waters had
tethered him, and, with his rifle firj^ly
grasped in one hand, started to mount.

  For some reason or other, the horse was
a bit skittish. He began to describe a cir-
cle, as a horse will when a strange mount
tries to get astride him.

  The stranger was unprepared for this.
The horse circled and reared. The rider
tried hard to get his seat.

  Seth Waters saw his chance.

  Quick as a flash he dashed. He had but
one object in mind just then—the rifle.
That weapon was the law and order of the
scene.

  Ere the stranger was aware, Seth Waters
had the barrel of the gun gripped in his
strong hands.

   His grip was the grip of the man who is
desperate and is playing only-to win.

   As he tugged at the rifle, he gave the
horse several lusty kicks in the belly with
his right foot. This made the animal lunge
all the more.

   The stranger had one foot in the stirrup.
Plainly, he was on the defensive. He hung
onto his gun with a grip of death, but Seth
was more than a match.

  In another moment he had wrested the
rifle from the smaller man’s hand. He
stepped back a few feet, master of the sit-
uation.

  The stranger was on the horse's back!
Digging his heels into its flanks, he made a
dash for the opening in the chaparral to the
open road.

   Seth leveled the gun and fired.

   The man fell forward, the blood gushing
from his mouth. He fell head first into the
thick underbrush. If he spoke a word, Seth
did not hear it.

   The horse stopped short—frightened and
trembling. Seth rushed up to the animal
and grabbed the reins.

   He administered a kick to the body that
lay motionless at his feet, and uttered sev-
eral imprecations which, to him, were quite
necessary as a parting shot.

   The stranger did not hear. He had gone
to his reward.

   Seth wanted to make a complete job of it,
so he turned the body over and rifled the
clothing. In one of the pockets he found
ten loaded cartridges; in another, a plug of
tobacco; in another, a jack-knife that had
been recently sharpened, and—to his great
amazement—four dollars and fifty cents in
United States coin.

   “ Everything is coming my way,” he said
as he wrapped the money in his handker-
chief, dropped the cartridges in his pocket,
took a chew of the weed, and mounted the
horse.

CHAPTER XXIV.
“ Heads ” She Is.

UE started up the canon, leaving the
-*■ body to the tender mercies of the buz-
zards and the wolves. Thinking it best to
put as much distance as possible between
him and the scene of his most recent depre-
dations, he urged the horse to a fast lope.

   He rode on at a pretty rapid pace, until
it seemed that he had put three miles be-
IN THE HORNET’S NEST.

225

tween him and the scene of the murder.
Then he let the horse come down to a walk,
and, between a walk and a canter, he trav-
eled on and on.

  As the afternoon was waning, he found
himself not far from a dilapidated farm-
house. It was a low shanty built in an
opening in the canon.

  The small yard surrounding it contained
a cow and a horse, also a large dog of the
Newfoundland variety, which barked lustily
as he approached.

  There seemed to be chickens and pigs
everywhere—the one cackled noisily and
the others grunted defiance as he rode up
to the front gate.

  There was no other form of life visible.
Seth felt certain that the combined barn-
yard chorus would bring forth any human
being within hearing distance. He was not
a little surprised, therefore, when no hu-
man form came forth to greet him.

  Placing his hands to his lips, he gave a
loud cattle “halloo,” but this only fright-
ened the barnyard into a scamper.

  Dismounting, he walked up to the only
door of the shanty and knocked. A faint
rustling inside told him that there was some
one living there.

  Without further ado—the rifle dangling
from his left hand—Set'll opened the door
and walked in. In the one large room of
the mansion a weak, emaciated woman lay
on a rough couch.

  She tried to smile. Seth approached gra-
ciously, removing his hat, and giving other
assurances that he was to the manor born.

  “What do you want, sir?” The woman
spoke, but her voice was hardly discernible.
Then she lapsed into silence, and the twitch-
ing on her face showed that she was suf-
fering great pain.

  “I am traveling toward the south,
ma’am,” replied Seth Waters in his very
best style. “ I am hungry, and came here
to see if I could purchase food.”

  “ I am sick, and cannot get up,” said the
woman. “ My husband has gone to Santa
Maria for a doctor. I would like to help
you, but it is impossible.”

  “ Your husband gone to Santa Maria for
a doctor—and you here alone! ”

  Seth looked as if human sympathy were
his with a mortgage.

  “There was no one to stay with me. I
am too weak to get up.”

  This awful picture of frontier life, of
the fortitude and patience of the women
3 RR

who braved its hardships that their hus-
bands might have a chance to seek fortune
in an untried and untrodden land, touched
the heart of the desperado.

  “How far is it to Santa Maria?” he
asked.

  “ About twelve miles to the southeast,”
she directed.

  “ That way,” said Seth, pointing in the
direction in which he had been traveling.

  The woman nodded.

  Seth Waters thanked her and started to
go. She spoke to him again—this time a
little louder and with some exertion.

  “ If you are very hungry,” she said, “ and
can wait; my husband will be here shortly.
He will get you something.”

  “ No, thank you,” replied Seth.

  Brutal as he was, he would not let a
woman think that he would hang around
for food. That wasn’t Seth W’aters’s idea
of the manner in which things should be
done.

  Had she been strong and well and denied
him food, had she asked him to depart like
a common tramp, he would have held her
up with his rifle and made her cook the very
best on the place for him. But, as I have
said, food was not a matter of great impor-
tance with this man.

  However, he left the place with commend-
able courtesy and closed the door. Then
he slunk around to the kitchen entrance and
stole a piece of bacon that was hanging
near the door.

  “ It may come in handy,” said Seth, as
he jumped on his horse and rode in the
direction of Santa Maria.

  He had partly decided to spend a few
days in that old Spanish settlement. As he
sauntered along, he wondered if he really
looked sufficiently respectable to make the
visit.

  It had been so long since he 'had been
where civilization assembled that he began
to wonder if he were quite safe in taking
a risk.

  However, he would take time to think it
over. Swerving the horse to one side, he
rode up the somewhat steep side of a small
mountain.

  He spied a huge rock and a clump of
trees. These afforded shelter for himself
and his horse, and he was easily pleased at
his selection when he dismounted and looked
around him.

  To be sure, it wasn’t much of a place for
the horse, for the grass was pretty short,
226

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

and there was no water; but the animal had
had his fill only a few hours before, and.
Seth did not worry.

  He gathered some sticks, and soon had a
fire. Taking his knife from his pocket, he
sliced some of the bacon. In the absence
of a pan, he held the bacon over the fire
at the end of a long stick. He cooked it to
a turn, laid the strips on slices of the sour
bread, and enjoyed a really good meal.

  As he devoured his food, he turned over
in his mind all the various points of the
situation.

  Santa Maria was one of those towns
where strangers arrived at all times of the
day or night; for, at the time of this story,
many and peculiar were the wanderers over
the face of the far western country.

  Men and their families would travel by
horse from the farthermost parts of south-
ern Mexico far up into the newly found
El Doradoes of wealth which are now the
thriving States of Colorado, Nevada, and
California.

  They would return to the south with their
well-filled pouches and mingle with the new
faces from the East. In these crowds were
men of all kinds and character. One might
rub elbows with an honest prospector on
one side, and with the most daredevil des-
perado on the other.

  It was a common thing for a strange
horseman to ride up in front of a saloon,
dismount, and walk in and be at home in
a few moments. These strangers were usu-
ally well-heeled with pistols and money.
No one asked where they got the latter lest
he get a taste of the former.

  So, taking all these things into consider-
ation, Seth Waters decided that it might not
be bad for his health if he passed a few
days mingling with the bright spirits of
the old town.

  It might be a trifle distasteful to his
mode of life to arrive there with just four
dollars and a few cents. That wouldn’t
go very far. It wouldn’t buy much liquor;
and if he were invited to sit in a poker
game, it might vanish with the first pot.

  Really, he should have more money.
There was the sick woman whom he had
just left. In some corner of her Shanty
there might be a hidden stocking contain-
ing some hard-earned savings.

  He needed them more than she. But—
no. He suddenly thought otherwise. He
would not rob a woman. At least, he would
not run the risk of so doing.

  Attacking a woman was one thing not
tolerated in the variegated system of high-
way robbery of that country. There was
some sort of admiration frequently ex-
pressed for a man who could make a clever
horse “ deal ”—as the game of horse-steal-
ing was popularly called—and the cour-
ageous road-agent had his host of worship-
ers. But the man who would rob a woman
—he was hunted to his hole and hung!

  No, it would not do to rob a woman.

  Seth slept calmly that night beside the
sheltering rock. In the early forenoon of
the following day he took a reef in the
horse’s cinch, threw his leg over the saddle,
and started down the hill.

  When he reached the road, he paused for
a moment and took a coin from his pocket.

  “ Heads for Santa Maria,” he said as
he flipped it in the air.

  He caught it on his palm. It came
“heads.”

CHAPTER XXV.

Dead or Alive!

CANTA MARIA boasted of some dozen
^ or more saloons in a population of
only several thousand. Seth stopped at the
first one he saw. Outside, several horses
were hitched to a watering trough, and he
found a place for his thirsty mount beside
one of them.

  He walked inside. A motley crowd was
standing around the fly-bedecked bar, and
another crowd was watching a poker game
in a side room. Seth stepped up to the bar.
Instinctively the bartender passed over a
glass and a bottle. Seth threw down a coin,
filled his glass, and turned, resting his
elbow on the bar to drink.

  As he did so, a small, official-looking
notice in a battered frame arrested his at-
tention. Perhaps he might not have noticed
it had not the top line particularly caught
his eye. It read:

$1,000 REWARD!

  He walked across the room to learn whose
head was worth so much money.

  The glass almost dropped from his fin-
gers and the marrow almost froze in his
veins when he found that it was his own.

  It read, “for the capture of Seth Waters
dead or alive."

  “Dead or alive! Dead or alive!”

  Seth repeated the words again and again.
IN THE HORNET’S NEST.

227

Then he read on: “For the murder of
Philip Garrick, ranchero, of Rosalia.”

  A further paragraph announced that the
reward would be jointly paid by the county
authorities and Cannita Arcana.

  Seth read it once more so as to get it
well posted in his memory, and returned to
the bar.

  “Did you know him?” asked the bar-
tender, stopping in his work of polishing
glasses to become sociable.

“No,” said Seth. “Give me another.”
“First time I ever see a reward of that
size posted up in this place for a man,” the
bartender went on. “ Guess they must want
him pretty badly.”

  “Why don’t they run him-down?” ask-
ed Seth with his most gifted touch of care-
lessness.

  “ They’d have a husky gettin’ that fel -
ler,” said the bartender with a smile. “ He's
the slickest thing that’s been in these parts
in years. He’d shoot on sight or rob in a
minute. I guess nobody wants to tackle
him unless he can do so in the dark and
then get the drop on him.”

   Seth did not dislike this rather exagger-
ated opinion of his ability.

  He threw the second drink down his
throat.

  “ Have one on me," said the man behind
the bar, passing the bottle.

  “No, thanks,” Seth replied. “I’m just
passing through town on my way south—
and that stuff only agrees with me when I
take just a little of it.”

  He put the change in his pocket and
went once more to the notice. Again he
read it very carefully, especially the rather
minute description of himself.

  He had a twinge of fear as he wondered
if he were in any immediate danger. He
wished that he could look into a mirror
without being .observed, to see if the descrip-
tion of his features tallied with his present
appearance. He hoped that his recent life
in the wilderness had sufficiently changed
him to render him unrecognizable.

  He-turned again. The man behind the
bar was looking at him.

   “Seem interested in that,” he said.

  “ I was just thinking what I would do
if I had that thousand," Seth replied. “ It’s
a lot of money.”

   “ Bet your life,” said the bartender.

  Seth stepped outside and mounted his
pony. He rode on into the little town,
whose houses were scattered irregularly in

order to give their owners plenty of space
for flowers and sunshine, and whose busi-
ness streets were quaint with the idleness
of the period.

   “ Dead or alive,” he repeated. K Dead or
alive.”

  He rode on and he saw another saloon.
He did not dismount, for he thought it best
to go through Santa Maria at a jog and
make for the hilly wilderness beyond the
city’s borders. Once there, he would be
free with his thoughts and his horse, and
would plan a journey for the future.

  There was the customary amount of
lethargy in the old town. No one even
turned a head to notice him—him, Seth
Waters, on whose head was a reward of a
thousand dollars if he were captured dead
or alive!

   It was a wonderful feeling! It thrilled
him! The very thought of being able to
ride unnoticed through the streets of the
town when he was wanted—dead or alive!

  The situation so thrilled him that he
laughed almost outright. Then that deadly
notion that has b^en the cause of so many
a man’s downfall—just cne more drink—
came to him.

   Just one more drink to celebrate his vic-
tory! Just one more to the old world and
Rosalia and Carmita, whom he had so
beautifully fooled, and he would take his
way to the mountains, and the price for his
body would become a relic of the past!

   The next saloon was in the center of the
town’s activity. Like the first one that he
visited, there were some horses tied to a
trough outside. This place seemed to be a
bit gayer than the first. There were a
dozen or so men seated on the porch. From
the interior came the dulcet tones of man-
dolin and guitar, played as only the people
of the southland can play.

   The men eyed Seth Waters rather keenly
as he entered the place—and he seemed to
lie more than usually conscious that he was
being observed. Then he tried to make
himself think that his imagination was get-
ting the best of him.

  As in the former place, he ordered a
drink. As he lifted it to his lips, he turned
and scanned the walls. There were more
people in this place than in the other.
Some of them were standing against the
walls and it was difficult to see, but Seth’s
keen eyes peered hither and yon and soon
they rested on the notice posted in a rather
conspicuous place at the end of the bar.
228

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

  He swallowed the whisky and sauntered
over to the notice. He had left his rifle
outside, strapped to his saddle, as he thought
it best not to attract too much attention by
bringing it into the place.

  Perhaps, if he had not done so, the fol-
lowing incident would not have happened
without the side issue of a struggle.

  Seth had just turned to go. About the
middle of the room, two men, who had
been watching him closely, stepped in front
of him.

  One of them leveled a revolver.

  “Hold up your hands, Seth Waters!”
commanded the armed man.

  Seth was so terribly taken by surprise
that his breath came in short, quick gasps.

  “I’ll do as you bid, because I’m un-
armed; but I’m not Seth Waters.”

  His hands went over his head.

  “That don’t go with me,” said the man
with the gun. “I’ve seen you a hundred
times over in Rosalia, Seth. I know you—
and my friend here knows you.”

  The speaker was Dick Clancy, a young
rancher who owned a great tract of grazing
lands between Rosalia and Santa Maria.
The man with him was Tom Ferris, his
head vaquero. He had also been a vaquero
for Philip Garrick.

  In an instant the saloon was in a com-
motion. As fire spreads over dry grass, the
news that Seth Waters had been caught
spread throughout Santa Maria.

  “Search him for his gun,” said Clancy
to Ferris.

  “ I’m unarmed,” protested Waters. “ My
gun is strapped to my horse. I tell you,
this is a mistake! ” he went on loudly.
“Get through with this work and take me
to court. I’ll quickly prove that I’m not
the man you say I am.”

  Ferris made a hurried search and was
convinced that Waters was unarmed.

  “ All right,” said Dick Clancy. “ Lower
your arms.”

  An immense crowd had gathered outside.
Seth Waters was marched to the jail. Dick
Clancy was on one side holding his arm.
Tom Ferris was on the other.

  The residents of the town came from all
directions. They blocked the street to get
a glimpse of the now famous bandit and
murderer. When the entrance to the jail
was reached, it was with some difficulty
that he was gotten inside.

  Once in the custody of the sheriff, he
was lodged in a cell. He was asked if he

did not care to have a barber trim his beard
and long hair. This Seth refused. If there
was any hope for freedom now, it would
be due to his unnatural growth of beard,
and there was no law in the land that could
make him shave against his wishes.

  However, ere the day ended it was pretty
generally agreed that the man in jail in the
little town of Santa Maria was the real
Seth Waters, and that Dick Clancy and
Tom Ferris were th? richer by a thousand
dollars. And the most excited man of all
was the bartender in the first saloon where
Seth stopped. He had come breathless to
the jail and had told his story to the sheriff.

  That worthv took him to Seth’s cell and
let him have a look at the prisoner.

  The young man, as he stood in front of
Seth’s cell, swore at him.

  “What’s the matter, sonny?” asked
Seth.

  “Why didn’t you tell me who you were
when you was in my place? I might have
had that thousand dollars instead of.those
two fellows! ”

  Seth Waters simply grinned.

CHAPTER XXVI.
A Woman’s Way.

YTlfORD was quickly sent to Rosalia.

      Through that city and on beyond,
from mouth to mouth, the news was spread.
Seated in the little room of her old uncle’s
home, Carmita first heard it. She was sew-
ing the thickest of crepe to her black dress,
for she had sworn never to wear color
again. Philip had been to her the world-
Now that he was gone, she would always
wear mourning.

  She knew that the day would come when
Seth W’aters would be found. Ever since
the death of Philip, as day slipped into day
and no news of the man came to Rosalia,
her friends told her that he would never be
heard from again. But Carmita was not
of that belief. She persisted that he would
some day be brought to justice.

  “You are foolish,” they said. “He is
far beyond danger of apprehension.”

  “I have willed it,” she replied.

  She was sitting in her old uncle’s home
when a young vaquero dashed up to the
front door.

  The horse was flecked and panting. The
rider was almost breathless. He was one
of the fine young Western vaqueros who
IN THE HORNET’S NEST.

229

had herded cattle for years on the ranch
of Philip Garrick.

  Carmita saw him dismount. She saw
his trembling pony, and she read his face.
She knew—knew all. He did not have to
tell her as she opened the door to let him
enter.

   “ They’ve got him! ” she said excitedly,
as the first smile that her face had known in
days illuminated it. “They’ve got him!
I know! Where ? ”

   “ He’s in jail—in Santa—Santa Maria! ”
the vaquero gasped.

  “Are you game to go there with me?”
said Carmita.

  “ If you wish it, madam,” he replied.
“ But my horse is all in. I must have
another.” -

  “ There are horses in my stable,” she
answered. “ I have kept them ready day
and night—day and night—waiting for this!
I knew this news would come.”

  “Will you drive or ride?” the vaquero
asked.

  “We can make better time on horse-
back,” Carmita replied. “ I want to get
there before sundown. Go to the barn and
help the man saddle the two horses in the
first stalls. I will be ready in a moment! ”

  She dashed up-stairs and put on her
riding habit and a black sombrero. She
was ready before the horses. When the
vaquero appeared, riding one and leading
the other, he dismounted with all the gal-
lantry of the gentlemen of his time to assist
her to mount.

   Before he had a chance to lower his hand
that she might place her foot on it, Carmita
was in her saddle.

   “ Come on! ” she shouted as she dashed
tlirough the gate.

  The vaquero followed, but he had some
trouble in catching up. Mazeppa, bound to
the back of a wild steed, never rode so
madly as did this woman filled with the
hope of wreaking the vengeance that she
had harbored in her soul ever since her
heart’s ideal was killed.

   Her horse's hoofs kicked up a cloud of
dust as he galloped on—and for some miles
this was the only guide that her companion
had to keep him in her path.

  Carmita’s teeth were clenched as he
dashed madly on. She urged her steed at
every faltering sign in his gait.

   Now and then she felt the small pistol
which was strapped to her waist. She want-
ed to be sure that it was there. She might

     A	0

have to use it. Why had she been prac-
tising with it so much of late?

  Just outside the limits of Santa Maria
she reined up and dismounted.

  Taking a handful of grass from the road-
side, she wiped the foam that had flecked
her horse’s body. Her companion cantered
up. She bade him do likewise. He obeyed
without parley.

  In a few moments the animals had re-
gained some of their wind and looked as if
they had not been driven beyond human
endurance.

  Carmita did not want to attract too much
attention as she entered the city. The hour
was somewhat late, and a woman on a hard-
ridden horse might be more than ordinarily
noticed. So they entered the town more
slowly.

   “ Do you know where the jail is located ? ”
she asked.

  Her companion replied that he could
take her straight to its door.

  In ten minutes they were there. Carmita
was the first to dismount. She handed her
reins to her companion, saying:

  “Wait here.”

  In another moment she knocked on the
door of the jail. The sheriff opened it and
she entered.

  She told him who she was and of her
interest in the prisoner. She told him that
she had come all that long distance to
identify him.

   At her urgent request, the sheriff took her
to Seth Waters’s cell. He was stretched on
the hard couch, his body heaving witli the
regularity of sleep.

   The sheriff called to him, but he did not
respond. Then that officer entered the cell
and awoke him. Seth sat up and looked
at his jailer.

   “A lady to see you,” said the sheriff.

  Seth Waters only grunted. He had little
or no use for women. His first thought
was that some religious fanatic had come
to help him save his soul. He did not
want to see a woman, and he plainly said so.

  “This lady has come some way to see
you,” the sheriff continued. “ I think she
knows you. Get up, anyhow.”

  Seth stood up and faced Carmita.

  She looked at him with the keenness of a
lynx. She eyed him from head to foot
through the prison bars.

  Then her eyes filled with tears. There
he was. She knew him. She had seen him
around Rosalia and the store kept by old
230

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

Eugene too many times not to know him,
and not to be able to recognize him through
any disguise whether real or false.

  There stood the man who had murdered
the only man in the world she had ever
loved! There stood the man who had
brought more unhappiness into her life than
life itself. There stood the man she hated,
that she loathed as one would loathe a viper.
There stood Seth Waters!

  The tears came to her eyes. For a mo-
ment she.lost control of herself and caught
the bars for support. Then she regained
her strength and her courage.

  Seth Waters stood before her, the pic-
ture of sheepish docility. Surely this was
the most trying situation in which he had
ever been placed.

  “Seth Waters,” said Carmita, “I know
you. I know you, and you can’t get awav
"from that. I would know you among a
thousand men. Tell me, are you sorry?
Are you sorry for the misery that you
brought to me ? ”

  “ Am I sorry—for what ? ” he replied.
“You are mistaken, madam.”

  The sheriff was called into his private
office. The two were left alone.

  “You killed Philip Garrick,” she said.
“You shot him down in cold blood.”

  “ I never shot him—or any other man,”
protested Waters.

“ You lie! You lie! You dog—you lie! ”
Carmita turned white with rage. Step-
ping back a few feet, she drew her revolver.
She had kept it carefully concealed until
now.

  Leveling it at the man in the cell, she
said:

  “ Seth Waters, prepare to meet vour
God! ”

  “Don’t shoot—don’t!” he cried.

 Carmita continued:	_

  “ Such men as you do not deserve a trial.
You ought to be shot like dogs! ”

  He saw that she was desperate. He
reached through the bars. His long arms
were stretched to their fullest, his long fin-
gers clutched in the madness of a caged
beast. He ran into a corner of the cell and
crouched there. '

(The

   “ Don’t shoot! Don’t, don’t shoot! Help!
Help!” he yelled.

   Carmita stepped to the bars and took de-
liberate aim. Seth Waters cried once more
—this time for pardon. For the first time
in his crime-filled life he was at the mercy
of another, and—a woman at that!

   Carmita pulled the trigger. Seth Waters
rose to his feet with startling suddenness
and placed his hands on his heart.

   His cries were silenced. He fell to the
stone floor—dead.

   There was commotion in the other cells,
but Carmita was undisturbed. The sheriff
and several of the trusties rushed to her
with blanched faces.

   Before they had time to speak she told
them what she had done.

   Handing her revolver to the sheriff, she
said calmly, but with deliberation:

  “ I have avenged the death of Philip
Garrick. I have killed the man who mur-
dered him. I swore that I would do it.
You may do with me as you please.”

   “ Who are you, madam? ” asked the sher-
iff, taking the weapon and leading her to
his office.

  “ I am Carmita Arcana. Philip Garrick
was the man I loved.”

   That ni^ht the vaquero rode back to Ro-
salia alone. The next day, by universal
request, Carmita was given her liberty. The
old Governor of the State knew her and
knew that she had told the truth. She
returned to old Caillo's home.

  Years afterward I saw her there. She
was still the same beautiful Carmita. The
white hairs had come to her, but her face
had all of its old glory and wonder.

   She had never forgotten the vow that she
had made to her lover, her Maker, and
herself—that she would marry no man but
Philip Garrick.

  Through all her life she devoted her-
self to the old Catholic mission at Rosalia,
patiently and calmly waiting for the final
call when she would join Philip across the
great shadow.

   In the little acre of God that nestles in
the shade of Mount Whitney, their graves
are side by side.

The Miracle of the Mails

BY THADDEUS S. DAYTON.

HANDLING the United States mail is a sacred duty, and the government
on whom this duty is imposed fully recognizes the importance of its
sacredness. If you post a letter with a two-cent stamp in the right
hand corner of the envelope, that letter is the property of the United States until
it is delivered at its destination, and the government has only one object in view
—to deliver that letter with the greatest possible speed wherever it is destined
to go Within the limits of the two-cent rate.

    Perhaps no other country in the world handles so much mail matter as the
United States. If it were not for the splendidly equipped R. M. S., the alert
and keen-eyed clerks, and the fast mail trains—what would the mail service
amount to? The railroads truly are the backbone of this gigantic scheme of
perpetual motion, handling over twenty billion pieces of mail a year.

Uncle Sam’s Gigantic Task as a Letter-Carrier and What He Does, with
the Aid of thelRailroads, To Make His Service

a Success.

      T is the luncheon-hour at Slug &
         Case’s big printing - house in
         Pearl Street, New York. The
         machines have stopped. A hun-
         dred girls are gathered in groups
         —eating, chatting, and giggling.
         Over on a window - ledge, her forehead
         puckered, one of them is busily writing.

  She has the stub of a pencil and some
coarse white paper taken from a pile by
one of the presses. Her pencil makes hard
work of it, but the page fills steadily.

  “It’s to Jack, up in Alaska. Barrow is
the name of the place, wherever that is,”
she says. “ I must mail it to-night. It is
something I must tell him at once.”

  Barrow is one of the most northerly post-
offices in the world. No telegraph-wires
have been stretched there.

  With infinite care and effort she finishes
the letter just as the whistle shrills its sum-
mons back to work. Hastily she addresses
it, and shoves it in the pocket of her work
apron.

  Down in Wall Street, at the same hour,
there is a meeting of a board of directors,
composed of dignified, powerful men, whose
wealth foots up millions. It is necessary to
get word immediately to a member of their
company, also in Barrow. The letter must
reach him as swiftly as possible. The mail
is the only resource. The board calls up
the post-office.

  “If you get the letter to us by seven
to-night, it will catch the next boat out
from Seattle. There is mail service there
but three times a year,” replies the post-
office.

  The printing-house girl posts the letter
to her sweetheart in a box under the Brook-
lyn Bridge a few minutes after six o’clock.
It reaches the post-office at the same time
as the bulky linen envelope from the board
of directors. Millions are behind the one,
the commercial enterprise and force of men
of great financial power, and only the love
in a girl’s heart behind the other; but the
United States makes 110 distinction. The

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

shabby, pencil-scrawled envelope of the girl
rushes across the continent with the same
speed as the fat and valuable package that
is smeared with stamps and redolent with
importance.

  When these two letters reached the post-
office they fell into a mass of mail that con-
stantly heaped up, and then spread out like
the waves of a great river—hundreds of
thousands of letters to ever)' part of the
country and for every corner of the world—
a flood that had no end.

  Men were ready for them; the number
did not dismay them. Each package-stamp
was the pledge of the government for speedy
service. Wagons were on hand to convey
them to the waiting mail-trains.

  Any other body of men would have been
confused, but not the United States post-
office. With incredible swiftness these
heaps of mail were sorted, and these two
letters bound for the most northerly post-
office on the Western Hemisphere were
thrown into the compartment marked “ Se-
attle,” with hundreds more.

Uncle Sam Has the Right of Way.

  Inside the hour, with tens of thousands
more, they started their journey across the
continent with never a second of delay.
Every postage-stamp is an imperative com-
mand to hurry, hurry, hurry! It is the gov-
ernment’s vast and complex task to deliver
letters of its citizens. It is the far-flung
lines of steel, the trains hurrying at breath-
less speed, that make possible the daily
miracle of the mails.

  In their journey westward these two
Alaska-bound letters reached a city that was
tied hand and foot with a big and bitter
strike. Not a wheel was turning in the
railroad yards. Sullenly the strikers and
the stricken faced each other, but the fast
mail-train whizzed by just as it had every
day for years.

  Other great interests might be tampered
with and delayed, but not the postal service
of the United States.

  Only war or the forces of nature can
stop the progress of the mails. In the cities
the wagons of the Post-Office Department
have the right of way over all other vehi-
cles. When the rails are blocked the first
cars that go forward are those marked
“United States Mail.” On the high seas
the mail - steamers are forbidden to stop
merely to save property. They may pause

  in their rush across the ocean only to rescue
imperiled lives.

  At Seattle the boat that was to carry the
Alaskan mail was waiting, ready to cast off
its lines as soon as the pouch of letters was
aboard. It was only a little pouch; but the
steamer waited for it, just the same.

  Through desolate -seas where the fog
hangs thick, over long trails across the
mountain ranges that towered above endless
leagues of black forest—by steam, by dog,
by man—the two letters posted in the center
of the metropolis of the western world
moved forward and northward.

  The pouch that held them was as lean as
the dogs that toiled onward with the sledge.
It was the same sort of grimy sack of can-
vas and leather, stenciled with the initials
of the republic, that holds the letters wher-
ever the flag flies.

  Here is one problem of the hundreds
of thousands that the postal service of the
United States has to solve, aided by the
railroads. It is no more difficult than in-
numerable others. It is only more pic*
turesque.

  At any cost, at the expense of any ef-
fort, the government must deliver with all
possible speed the letters entrusted to its
care. The motto of the old “ Star Route ”
service still prevails—“ Certainty, Celerity,
and Security.”

  By fast mail - train^ by stage, by any
other means of transportation possible, the
government must deliver letters to Alaska,
the Philippines, to any town within its
dominion, no matter how remote. Every
impediment of time and distance must be
surmounted. Thus, in Alaska, all other
plans failing, the reindeer post came into
play.

The Railroads’ Little Bill.

  Only once a year, and then during the
summer, mail can reach Barrow by water.
The two other mails a year must be carried
overland. Reindeer have proved the only
method. Here is a condition where neither
man-power, steam-power, nor dog-power
can prevail.

  Twice a year, therefore, in this part of
Alaska lone figures wait in the red-roofed
schoolhouse or on the snow-banks for the
incoming mail, the sledge with three rein-
deer hitched tandem.

Only thirty- civilized people live in Bar-
row, but it is just as important in the eyes
of the post'al service of the United States to

get letters to this little community as it is
to deliver them to some populous city that
is linked to the rest of the country by all
the facilities of modern transportation.

  It is even more important, for enormous
sums have to be spent to make service like
this in out-of-the-way parts of the world
as adequate as possible. It is a profitable
proposition to deliver many times a day-
huge quantities of mail to cities like Chi-
cago, Philadelphia, Boston, and New York;
but when it comes to the few letters that
are destined to far-off places it is a very
different affair.

  So,	the two-cent stamp that Mary Smith
put on her letter to her sweetheart at Bar-
row represents but a thousandth part of
what it cost the government to deliver it.

$50,000,000 lo the Railroads.

  The importance of the railroads in this
problem of postal transportation may be
gaged by the fact that in 1908 the govern-
ment paid the railway companies close to
$50,000,000 for hauling the mails. This
enormous sum is nearly twenty - five per
cent of the total expenditures of this branch
of the Federal service. In addition to this,
the Post-Office Department paid over $17,-
000,000 to its 15,000 railway postal clerks
that year.

  Nearly $70,000,000 is, indeed, a stupen-
dous sum; but when the railroads, and the
part they play in postal service, come to be
analyzed in connection with the huge
amount of detail work they are turning out
daily, even this vast amount seems small.
For the railroads not only carry the mails
from place to place, but while doing so they
are transporting on their trains 6,000 trav-
eling post-offices, where each hour of every
run letters by the hundreds of thousands
are being sorted for distribution.

  A bare statement of this sort is only in-
teresting in a statistical way; but here is an
instance of how the mails are handled when
they are being whirled rapidly across the
country at an average speed of forty miles an
hour, taking all trains—not only the limited,
but the slower ones—into the average.

  If the mails were to wait in the post-
offices until they were properly sorted and
distributed, there would be n tremendous
delay. It is probable that in a large num-
ber of cases it would take from twelve to
twenty-four hours longer for the mails to
reach their destinations. On fast mail-

  trains everything possible is sorted after
the train starts.

  It takes nine hours for the fast mail to
reach New York City from Pittsburgh over
the Pennsylvania Railroad. On that train
the four postal clerks sort out on each trip
from 30,000 to 40,000 letters. They make
them up in small packages for the different
sections of the cities of Philadelphia and
New York. Each branch office in these
cities gets a package, or perhaps even more
than one, of the letters that are to be dis-
tributed in the territory that it covers.

  Not only this, but special packets are
made up for each of the large hotels, banks,
department-stores, and commercial houses.
That is the way the railway mail works,
doing everything it possibly can to save
time by seconds and minutes.

  Sixteen per cent of all the mail in the
United States originates in New York City,
eleven per cent in Chicago, while Boston
and New England originate about eight
per cent. It is the gigantic publishing in-
terests of New York that raise this per-
centage so high, the mail-order business in
Chicago being largely responsible for that
city’s having the second place.

   The entire country is divided into eleven
parts for the systematic working of this
railway mail service, the division superin-
tendents being stationed in Boston, New
York, Washington, Atlanta, Cincinnati,
Chicago, St. Louis, San Francisco, Cleve-
land, St. Paul, and Fort Worth, Texas.

  People are so accustomed to getting let-
ters without delay that they do not stop to
think of the complicated machinery neces-
sary for delivery.

6,000 Mail-Trains a Day.

   Naturally, that division of the East that
comprises the States of New York, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware and
the eastern shore of Maryland has the
largest daily individual share of this, busi-
ness. Other divisions may perform prodi-
gies in quick deliveries, but this second di-
vision of the railway mail service—the first
is at Boston—has its daily schedule of

6,000	mail - trains. Of these, 4,500 are
what are known as “baggagemen’s trains”
—that is, carrying only closed pouches for
the South and West. This leaves 1,500
distinct movements in this territory every
twenty-four hours where distribution in
mail-cars is going on.
234

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

  All mail service on the railroads is in-
cidental to passenger business. The pas-
sengers are first considered from a revenue-
earning point of view on all fast trains, and
the mail service is comparatively insignifi-
cant.

  Except for the rather empty honor of
being mail-carriers, and hence having the
most speedy service between given points,
it would, as a matter of fact, pay the rail-
roads better not to carry the mails at all.

  Even the experts in the Post-Office De-
partment concede that the railroads are be-
ing paid only about half what should come
to them. They have to furnish cars and
adapt their schedules so as to provide for
innumerable connections, and in the long
run the business is highly unprofitable to
them.

   Altogether, a superior sort of service has
to be given. On the New York Central
lines, from New York to Buffalo, 129 trains
a day are run for mail service. This is
probably the largest account on the govern-
ment books with any railroad.

  The New York Central is now being
paid annually nearly $2,000,000, with an
additional allowance of §265,000 for postal-
cars. This is at the rate of $4,518.67 a
mile of road a year for 411,838 pounds of
mail a day on the average that is hauled
over 439 miles.

  Thus, one single railroad gets more than
one-twenfy-fifth of the total governmental
expenditure for this purpose.

  This happens to be because this road
carries an enormous quantity of through
mail and has a number of big cities and
prosperous smaller towns along its tracks.

How the Rates Are Made.

   It is interesting to turn from this to the
heaviest postal weight carried on any rail-
road route of the country. This is be-
tween New York and Philadelphia over the
Pennsylvania lines. The run here is short
—only ninety miles. The government pays
this company a little less than $500,000 a
year, but a much higher rate a mile per
annum—$5,448.91—for an average of a
little less than 500,000 pounds daily.

  The government lias a peculiar way of
paying for the mail service. It weighs the
mails once every four years, dividing the
entire country into four sections, and over a
period of ninety days weighs every pouch
and every package in one of these divisions

each year. Section 1, embracing the entire
East, was weighed in the spring of 1909.
It takes almost a year for the government’s
experts to tabulate the figures and estab-
lish new average rates for the succeeding
four years.

  Notwithstanding the fact that these four
great railroad divisions are known in the
Post-Office Department as “contract sec-
tions,” the railroads really make no con-
tracts at all. The nearest they come to it
is signing at each “weighing” what is
known as a “Distance Circular.” This is
a statement on the part of each railroad as
to the number of miles and fractions of a
mile between each of its stations. It is re-
quired by the government in order that it
may take financial advantage of any short-
ening of the lines that has occurred during
the preceding four years.

21,000,000,000 Pieces of Mail.

  The road that signs this “ Distance Cir-
cular ” also agrees, according to the printed
statement, to carry the mail in accordance
with the government regulations. That
means at the rate fixed by law. What the
government pays is 10.96 cents for each
mile traversed. In 1905, the latest year
that has been calculated, the postal-cars of
America traveled 407,000,000 miles—equal
to about two round trips to the sun.

  As to the rights of the railroads in these
postal - carrying matters, former Congress-
man Jesse Overstreet, of Indiana, when he
was chairman of the Post-Office Committee
of the House of Representatives, said in a
speech that, in his opinion, the railroads
were not alone obliged to carry mail at (he
direction of the government, but that every
trolley-car could be pressed into service if
necessary and be forced to become a mail-
carrier.

  During 1908 the railway post-offices—
the postal-cars on the trains—assorted and
reassorted 21,650,000,000 pieces of mail.
Twelve billion was first-class mail. As to
this, a leading post-office authority recently
said:

  “ It is estimated that during the fiscal
year 1908 the public posted about 7,159,-
000,000 pieces of first-class mail, and about
4,739.000,000 pieces of other classes—all
for domestic destination. Of the first-class
mail, about seventy-five per cent was des-
patched to railroads, and of the other
classes over ninety-seven per cent.”
AT TIGER-TAIL SIDING

       BY RICHARD MAXWELL WINANS.

          A Cub Operator Kicks So Hard at Fate That
          He Manages To Block a Train-Robbery.

.HEN the big Atlantic
  rumbled out onto the
  table, groomed and
  polished to the very last
  touch, Dan Thomas,
  her grizzled old driver,
  was there to look her over.

  There was fast work cut out for 377 that
night, and she was one of the few on the
line that was able and fit to swing the trick;
she and her engineer, Dan Thomas.

  “Evenin’, Dick!” said Dan, turning to
the ruddy fireman fresh from the bunk-house
and ready for his run. “ How’s your work-
in’-pressure readin’ to-night?”

  “ Poppin’, Dan,” was the hearty response.
“ Got a white feather showin’, and the gage
cornin’ up steady. Never felt better in my
life; and if the symptoms was any stronger,
I reckon I’d git a right smart uneasy.”

  “ Mighty glad you’re feelin’. fit,” was
Dan Thomas’s quiet comment; “you’ll need

"vou'll need all your surplus ginger to-night."
235

all your surplus ginger to-night, Dick—and
then some.”

  “What’s on, particular?” queried Dick,
throwing his bundle to the gangway.

  “They’re givin’ us 17 away behind the
card to-night, along with mighty sharp or-
ders to close up the gap in the schedule over
our division, and it’s goin’ to eat up a lot
of steam to do it,” said Dan, as he started
across the tracks for the despatcher’s office.

  The rails had been bad on the eastern
side of the divide all the afternoon, and Dan
Thomas would pick up the heavy limited
at the top of the big hill nearly an hour
late. Almost all the way over his division,
the run was a drift down into the valley-
through the foothills, it was true, but there
was a good deal of level track and some
grades to negotiate, and with the almost
endless, tortuous curves, it was anything
but the easiest run on the line.

  To the officials of the road, however,
there were very urgent reasons why the
sealed express-car on that train should be
in Ogden on time, to be sure of making con-
nections with the Espee for Frisco, and they
intended that it should be, or would know
the reason why, as it was their greatest con-
cern to get it off their hands and on to
another line. The general superintendent
was aboard and a number of officers repre-
senting the express company’—all of them
men who were a good deal handier with a
forty-five than with a pen. If anything was
to happen to that car on its way to the Frisco
mint, they wanted to be present.

  On the train was a telegraph-operator,
equipped with what the old linemen know
as an emergency outfit, and in case of an
attempted hold-up they were prepared to
tap the wires at any point for the purpose
of sending out a general alarm in all direc-
tions. Several disastrous experiences in re-
cent years had made the management cau-
tious, and they were determined in this case
to play' the winning hand.

  “Hully Gee! But ain’t it hot four ways
from the Big Oven to-night!” sighed Joe
as he pushed his chair away from the rough
little telegraph-table, walked over to the
window and raised it. Then he propped
back the screechy little door so that it was
open wide.

   “ It’s as hot as it’s lonesome, out here in
these man-deserted foothills.” He raised
his elbow and leaned against the door-frame,
drawing a breath of fresh air into his lungs
as he looked off over the darkened range.

  “I don’t reckon it ever gits much hotter
than it is right now after that hill-ripping
thunder-storm, even down in Death Valley,
and if it's any more lonesome there, then I
pity the poor souls who go through the agony
of dy'in’ in it’s forsaken confines.

  “If a fellow wanted to take up the long
trail quiet-like, with no one around to make
a scene, I reckon he couldn’t select a more
forlorn and lonely spot than this here Tiger-
Tail Sidin’ to make his start from. If it’s
on the map, I don’t want no acquaintance
with the location, that’s all. It sure is the
limit.”

   Joe resumed his seat, and the interrupted
task of writing, a task to which he devoted
unusual care, for it was a letter intended
for a certain other lonesome individual just
across the divide, whom Joe had reluctantly-
left behind when they sent him to take his
turn on duty at one of the desolate little
work-train sidings among the foothills.

•	It was a trick the boy’s were all given a
turn at, during the course of their breaking
in, but Joe had chafed at it more than the
others, because a few of them had been torn
from a daily communion with the only girl.

  Joe did the best he could, however, to
bridge the unspeakable chasm with two let-
ters a day, handed to friendly trainmen,
fastened to the little bows he fashioned of
twigs to slip over an outstretched arm as the
trains whirled by.

   It was easier for him to write out the few
messages that came in to him over the wire
than to shape up things he wanted to say in
a love-letter, so Joe filled and lit another
pipe and pondered deeply'.

  He was soon in the throes of creation
again, the up-curling smoke from his pipe
rising and drifting lazily out through open
door and window, the pungent aroma of the
burning tobacco acting as a sedative to his
whirring brain.

  Three times the instrument near him
sounded his call. Joe. however, was far
away over the divide, where two brown eyes
were looking dreamily into his, and he did
not hear.

  What were sounders and calls and des-
patches and orders and even railroads,
when—then Joe came back.

  The despatcher was getting desperate,
and he was hammering Joe’s call over the
wire in jig time, when Joe straightened with
a start, reached over, and answered the call.

  Then there were some sharp questions to
answer as to the delay, and in the inter-
AT TIGER-TAIL SIDING.

missions the sounder snapped out some
stinging personalities about absence from
post and inattention to duty that put Joe
on his fighting edge. But the chief was 011
the wire, so Joe wisely held his hand.

  The order told him that No. 17 was car-
rying a special consignment of express which
was good reason for giving the line more
than the ordinary attention that night. All
lights and switches were to be immediately
inspected and tested, and the operator’s re-

down to his fingers—“ I wonder why Dan
quit the key in his prime and took to firin’
on the line. He sure was a past master at
jigglin' the key; couldn’t any of ’em send
or take faster than him.

“Queer thing, that!” and Joe drew
another match along the leg of his overalls.

     Joe, let me give you a tip,’ says Dan
the day he got me my first job.

“ ‘ I had a surprise-party handed me

ACROSS THE ROOM.

port filed at once. He was to report every
thirty minutes thereafter. They weren’t ta-
king any chances of a loose facing-point pi-
ling her up along the line on her run that
night.

  “ So long, you cranky old snappin’ turtle,”
Joe growled when the chief had cut out and
he had his order on the board. “ I guess 17
won’t muss up my front yard on account of
a loose switch at this no-man’s turn-out.
Dan’s known me ever since he began pound-
ing the code into my pate, ’way back when
he was still workin’ the key, an’ he always
found me Johnny-on-the-spot every time
the game was called.”

  Joe pushed his chair aside, picked up a
lantern and raised the globe to light it for
his round of the switches.

  “ I wonder—” and Joe let the match burn

the key,’ he goes on. ‘ It caught me right
off the reel ivhen I wasn’t lookin’, an’ it got
my nerve.

  “‘And this is the tip,’ says he; ‘don’t
you ever get rattled just because something
happens to drop on you, no matter what
it is.

  “1 The yellow streak is barred in the rail-
road game, kid!’ I remember, Dan con-
cluded very emphatic. ‘ So, if you ever get
anything handed to you, why, don’t go up in
the air, but just hang on and do business
regular without gettin’ it tangled up,’ ” and
Joe was on his way to the switches.

  When he had gone, a swarthy face ap-
peared in the rear doorway. With a look_
in the direction of the receding lantern, he
crossed the floor to the table and picked up
the copy of the order Joe had just written.
238

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

   “ So,” he grunted, “ thuh tip’s straight.
Got thuh stuff aboard an’ rushin’ it through.
Oh, yes; the switches will be all right, ole
lioss. Don’t you worry about that,” and he
disappeared in the darkness to the east of
the shanty.

  “They’re right as a clock, Mr. Snappin’
Turtle,” and Joe slid the lantern on the ta-
ble, opened his key and called the despatch-
er, tersely sending his report.

   Relighting his pipe, he hitched his chair
close to the table, and with half an hour on
his hands before making his next report, he
was soon absorbed in the more pleasing
work of finishing the interrupted letter.

  Again Joe’s mind went trailing over the
mountains, and, oblivious to his surround-
ings, he was unaware of the presence of the
burly form that soon appeared in the little
doorway at his back.

   Besides the first there was soon another,
and at their heels came a third. With the
litheness of a panther, the first moved across
the room, and with the sweep of an' up-
raised arm the butt of a heavy revolver
landed in a stinging blow on the side of Joe’s
head.

  “ Got him easy, Bill,” and other feet
clattered over the rough-planked floor.

  “Where’s thuh string? He's plumb stiff,
an’11 mighty like stay asleep till mornin’,
but there’s no use invitin’ trouble by takin'
a chance. Git thuh rope on his mitts, an’
tie ’em so’s he can’t wiggle a finger.

  “ There, now. Set him back an’ lash him
tuh th' chair so’s he can’t work loose if lie
does come out of it,” and the light rope was
wound around his arms and body, crossed
and knotted to the back and seat of the
chair so hard and tight that there was little
leeway for the unconscious man to breathe.

  “Not enough rope for his legs, eh?
Well, what of it? He ain’t a goin' to do no
walkin’ in his sleep, an’ he can't untie no
knots with his feet. He’s helpless as a
stuffed jack-rabbit.

  “Put your pliers away, Jack. If we cut
the wires they’ll be looking for trouble and
have a special out after us in no time. Just
leave the key shut the way it is and they’ll
more than likely think he’s gone to sleep 011
duty. He doesn't look like he'd lie able to
send any messages for a while."

  Outside there was the clank of iron as a
switcli-bar was shifted and fell into place,
and the eastern switch was open. Number
1 7 was running against trouble now.

  If Dan caught the red in time to stop,

the outcome would depend on how well the
special crew on 17 were prepared to fight.
If he didn’t, 17 would be ready for the
wreck train and the scrap-yard.

  The noisy little clock had ticked off half
an hour when the inert form on the chair
quivered. A spasm of trembling ran over
the body, the muscles twitched, the fingers
unclasped and Joe stirred, then was still.

  Another ten minutes, and he moved again.
There was a mumbling of inarticulate words,
and gradually into his dazed brain came a
blurred conception of what had happened.

  As he gradually regained the use of his
muscles, he strained at the cords that held
him. He was helpless, but awake at last.

  “You murderin’ devils! If you hadn’t
roped and liog-tied me so bloomin’ well,
I’d soon have the whole line listenin’ to
me,” and Joe struggled to shift his chair
across the room toward his key.

  “ If I can only git dose enough to reach
that key with my chin, why, maybe I—”
his foot slipped and struck heavily against
the battery-jar under the end of the table.
“ Hully mackerel! if I wreck that juice-tank
the play’s off,” and Joe again turned his
head toward the goal he was striving for, his
key on the table to the right.

  “Great howlin’ wildcats!” he exclaimed
as he found himself unable to budge the
chair any farther. “They’ve got th’ block
on me goin’ an’ coinin’! They’ve lashed
one of the chair-legs to that spike in the
wall. The key’s closed; an’ so’s th’ game, I
reckon.”

  His head bowed in despair as he realized
his helplessness. Suddenly he looked at
the clock.

  “ Forty-five,” he muttered reflectively.
“ Forty-five. If Dan’s got back the lost
time, 17's jest about pullin' out o’ her last
stop on the run—that is, till she strikes this
lay-out,” and Joe’s head again bent over
his breast.

  With a mental picture of disaster that
was to follow torturing his aching brain
to desperation, he shuffled his feet on the
floor in a frenzy of anxiety, and again there
came the clink of glass as his shoe struck
the battery-jar.

  “You thievin’ coyotes!” he cried, and
began working his feet feverishly toward
the jar. “ There's just one more bet to make
in this pot—an’ the bettin’s up to me. I'm
goin’ to call your hand, jest to show you I
ain’t of the four-flushin’ breed. I think I
got you topped, at that.”
AT TIGER-TAIL SIDING.

239

  Crowding down in his chair as much as
the ropes would permit, he stretched his right
leg toward the wall and soon had worked
a battery-jar at least six inches closer. He
drew it inch by inch toward him until he
could place his foot over its edge. Then,
with his toe in a loop of the wire that led
to the zinc plate on top, he raised it gently
from its position. Tediously, but surely, he
lifted it, until it was free of its liquid bath
and the sounder on the
table gave a sharp click.

He then lowered it to the
solution, and the sounder
clicked again.

 With every muscle
strained, and his nerves at
highest tension, he began
working the plate up and
down with methodical in-
tervals between the con-
tacts of zinc and liquid
that he hoped w o u 1 d
be understood somewhere
along the line.

  It was slow work. The
dots and dashes were long
drawn out. The message
lacked the speed of a nim-
ble finger on the key, but
Joe was getting his warn-
ing on the wire, even
though it was in a toil-
some, painful way.

  The message was short;
only four words and his
signature, but it required
a full minute to work it
out with his foot.

  After all, however, it
was an uncertainty in the
end, for there came no an-
swering tap on his sound-
er. The trick might fail in turning yet.
Heedless of that, he continued with the
dogged perseverance of a man playing a
losing game pluckily to the end. Each
minute the message was repeated, over and
over again.

  “What yuh got there?” sang out Dick,
as Thomas climbed aboard the engine with
a bundle wrapped in a small flour-sack.
“ Some neighbor’s back fence tenor you’re
takin’ out for a farewell tour of the line?”

  “Cats be shot! That’s the quickest way
with ’em, anyhow,” and Dan raised the lid
of his seat and dropped the package inside.

“ It’s a couple of pounds of good, strong
smokin’ for Joe down at Tiger-Tail Sidin’.
I’m thinkin’ he’s lonesome in that dump o’
nights, an’ he’ll be burnin’ the heart out of
his pipe for company when he can git the
right fillin’s, an’ I know the kind he likes
better’n any other.”

  “Always had a soft spot for Joe,’’ said
Dick, giving the bell-cord a pul'l as Dan
answered the signal to back out on the line.

  “I’d back him in any game he played,”
said Dan, as he set 377 rolling out.

  As she bumped gently against the for-
ward car of the limited, the superintendent
pulled himself up into the cab. With a
glance at the gage he laid his hand on Dan’s
shoulder.

  “ How’s your nerve to-night, Thomas ? ”
was his familiar greeting.

  “About on a par with the steam-gage
up there, Mr. Daniels,” was Dan’s good-
natured reply as he turned his head toward
the boiler-head, “ and I reckon it’s regis-
terin’ about all she ought to carry.”

  “That’s good,” said the superintendent,

TEDIOUSLY, BUT SURELY, HE LIFTED IT UNTIL IT WAS FREE
OF ITS LIQUID BATH.

stepping close to Dan perched on his seat.

“ I want you to give her the whip to-night.
Get every possible turn out of her on the
straightaways, and take every curve that will
stand the strain on speed.”

  Catching the hand-rail, he was about to
swing down when he called back:

   “ Miller’s handing you the ball, so you’re
off. Remember, you've got to make the
junction on the card! Do you get that?
All right,” and he was gone.

  “ Depend on this husky to keep the pot
a boilin’,” was Dick’s comment as the 377
took the slack out of the couplings and
picked up the heavy load in her wake.

  “ After all that, he can depend on me to
run her in on time, providin’ she holds to-
gether, even if I have to drag in some of
the track and a part of the road-bed along
with it.” Dan gradually opened up the
throttle as she clattered through the switches,
cleared the yards and started on her long
race against time that was to make a record
for the division.

  There were only three stops to make on
the run, and they were far between. After
they swung through Hell Gate she began
the four-thousand-foot drift into the foot-
hills through the Frying Pan country and
into Red Rock Canon.

  Dick was leaving behind him a volcanic
trail of black smoke and cinders as the long
string of lights reeled and whirled down
the crooked passes, while Dan sat stolid
and rigid as part of the cab-fixtures, his
keen eye following the lines of steel ahead,
his one determination being to catch the
schedule if the curves held and she stuck to
the track.

  With the mighty roar of mountain thun-
der, 377 was sweeping around the benches,
through the cuts and over bridges, her
flanges grinding fire on the sharp curves,
her eccentrics as close up as she would cut
her steam.

  There was but one more stop to make,
and with only forty miles from there on to
cover over straighter track, she had a fight-
ing chance of recovering all her lost time.
Dan was making good, although he knew
he was putting a terrific strain on both
train and track to do it.

  When the lights of the last little town
before their next stop loomed ahead, Dan
whistled for the yards, cut her off to ease
her up on the switches, then removed the
gauntlet from his hand, drew a ’kerchief
from his blouse and wiped the sweat from

his perspiring face and neck. As he finished,
they approached the last switch-lights, and
replacing his ’kerchief he reached up to open
the throttle and gave her full head again.

  When the bar was out and 377 was set-
tling into her long strides once more, Dan
reached to his hip and produced a heavy
black plug of tobacco. He’d been too busy
to enjoy a surreptitious bite until now, and
he felt that he had earned the luxury of a
chew after covering the longest and hardest
end of the night’s run with the schedule as-
sured for his division. The book of regu-
lations had a paragraph of protest against
the use of the weed on duty, but they were
still more specific against making such
reckless speed over this division, 'for that
matter. He had disregarded the last on
orders; he could now afford to disregard the
first on inclination.

   At the last stop, before the final spurt
into the end of the division, Dan looked
over his machine, his deft hand testing the
temperature of the various bearings with ex-
ceeding care, while his can was busy filling
the partly emptied cups.

   “Kind o’ leary about Tiger-Tail Sidin’,”
said the conductor, coming up from the tele-
graph-office and laying his hand on Dan’s
shoulder. “ Can’t get the operator.”

  “What’s that?” and Dan’s face was a
Study as he straightened up. “ Can’t get
Joe Tam? Something’s dropped out; take
it from me! ”

  “No; been tryin’ a half hour. Don't
answer. Guess the kid's asleep at the Bend.”
“Asleep!” roared Dan, as he whirled
about, his face set. “Cut that! It ain’t
so! I got Joe his job, knowin’ he was
right, an' I'll stand for him, personal. D’ye
understand! Does the old man know?”

   “ He’s up at the key now,” was the re-
sponse. “ Says lie’ll fire him soon as he gits
him on the wire in the morning. The wire’s
working all right. He just don’t answer.”
Well, just put it on your book that he
won’t—not for that,” Dan retorted, with
feeling. “ That storm that rolled through
here before we got in has been jugglin’ the
wires to the west, you’ll find—and that’ll
be the answer.”

   “ Thomas,” and the superintendent stood

right from the section-men, and then cut
her loose.”

    “All right, Mr. Daniels,” and Dan lifted
his torch to read the yellow flimsy handed
him. “No stops from here in. O.K.?”
“Not for anything less than an open
switch, a wash-out, or a land-slide, Thom-
as,” and Daniels was about to make a
sprint for his car, when he turned : “ That
cub down at Tiger-Tail is off the job to-
night. Watch your lights when you pick
up the bend. There'll be a vacancy down
there in the morning,” and he was off.

   “ In which case, there'll be two on this
line,” muttered Dan as he swung for the
gangway.

   For a mile or more Dan had her pulling
hard. Then, as he headed into the stretch
where trouble was reported, he closed the
flow of steam to a thread and laid his hand
on the air, his eye sharp ahead to catch the
first show of a light.

   Rounding a curve, he suddenly cut on
the air, opened the sand, turned her over
and give her the big hole. The lights ahead
were swinging across the track.

   Stopping close to the debris on the line,
Dan jumped from his cab and ran forward,
uttering scathing commentaries on the slow
work of the section-men. There was hard-
gained time slipping into the gap again,
with small chance now of regaining it.”
“Wake up, you sleepin' coyotes!” yelled
Dan as he laid hold with his own hands
and began tearing at the mat of brush and
mass of boulders and tangle of tree-limbs.

   “ Give a lift here on this rock, Dick,”
and they were rolling off a boulder that had
I teen dislodged by the upheaved roots of a
fallen tree.

   “We’re mighty lucky we're not going the
other way,’’ he called. “ It’ll take a couple
hours’ work to clear that inner track, but I
guess the section-gang will be able to let us
through in less than half an hour.”

   At the foot of one of the telegraph-poles
ljeside the track, he caught sight of the emer-
gency-operator adjusting his instrument to
send out Daniel’s order for the wrecking
outfit at Hanford to hurry to the scene of
the slide. Dan waited until he had finished
the message and was about to climb the pole
to disconnect his wires, and then stepped
forward.

   “Wait a minute,” he said. “I’d like to
raise Tiger-Tail Sidin'. Joe is a friend of
mine and I think lie’s in trouble.” ,

   “ All right,” said the operator. “ I must
    4 R R

report to Daniels, but I'll be back in a few
minutes. Here’s the climbing-irons.”

   Left to himself, Dan went up the pole,
made the proper connections and, descend-
ing, jerked open the k!ey and hurriedly sent
Joe's call out over the wire. He felt sure that
it would be ticked off in the little station at
the siding if the wires were working proper-
ly, but as yet there was no answer. He re-
peated the call, but there was no response
save a few disjointed clicks of the sounder.
Again and again he called, but still no an-
swer, only more spasmodic clicks.

   “ Something’s surely wrong,” he muttered.
“ They couldn’t raise him at Cold Springs,
and here I can’t get him either. Guess I’ll
have to give it up.”

   Once more he sent the call, and th^n the
sounder began to again move slowly up and
down. It’s dots and dashes came like the
working of a crippled wire, but gradually
they took on a semblance of Morse.

   Only the sound of the workmen clearing
away the debris and the throb of the engine
broke the silence as Dan knelt by the little
instrument on the rocks, intently listening,
all attention, with his face gradually taking
on a surprised look of understanding.

  “It’s mighty piece-meal sendin’,” he
whispered to himself, “and I’ll bet there’s
not an operator on the line that can make
it out, but I guess I've picked it up straight
enough, and the signature don’t leave any
doubt of who’s puttin’ it on the wire.”
“What’s up, Thomas?” Daniels shouted
down from the tracks.

   “•Not over sure myself, yet. Only think
there’s a sleeper awake, that’s all,” and
there was a trace of irony in Dan’s reply.

   With the outfit slung over his shoulder,
lie had soon made another ascent of the pole
with the experience and the agility of a
younger man.

   “ This is takin’ a right smart flier in the
prerogatives of railroadin’-rules, I reckon,”
he said to himself as he groped among the
wires, “ and the super on the job, at that.
But I’m goin’ to play this hand alone, and
we’ll see if Joe and I can’t show him that
there’s two of us awake on this line, any-
way. We'll know, leastwise, when we strike
the bend at the Sidin'.”

   In almost no time he had found a through
wire, and the click of the instrument came
down to those below as he opened the key
and begun calling the office at the western
end of the division, a town about five miles
beyond Tiger-Tail Siding.

' When the answer came, he started his
sending sharp and fast, increasing in his
nervous excitement until he made the key
fairly hum. He was in a fretful hurry to
get away, and deeply anxious, too, over the
result of his message. Twice the operator
broke in on him, he was so beyond his speed.

  As he closed the key he called to the fire-
man. “ Stand by, Dick, and take this out-
fit. We ought to be pulling out of here in a
couple of minutes.”

  As the released air wheezed out, 377
picked up her train with a savage jerk and

HE REPEATED THE CALL, BUT THERE
WAS NO RESPONSE.

  The nervous strain on the engineer in
racing against the schedule at a terrific pace
with a heavy train, over a road-bed handi-
capped by heavy curves, was now over-
shadowed on Dan’s face with an unspoken
something that made him look haggard in
the dim light of the cab.

  She was reeling off mile after mile now,
lurching and swaying and swinging as she

was away on the home-stretch with her
safety humming and every pound pulling
on the draw-bars, the heavy grade helping
her to quickly catch her topmost speed.

  “Keep a shakin’ that box an’ meltin’ the
coal, Dick. Burn her insides out, if you
have to, for I’m goin’ to cut off the corners
from here in,” and Dan began playing
every advantage for an extra-fast turn of the
wheels. Fort}' miles to go, and a better
track. He’d do it if 377 had it in her.

pounded the rails sidewise on the crooked
trail.

  Ten miles, fifteen—Dan began nervously
pulling his watch. Eighteen miles, nineteen
—they flashed by the lights of a little town
setting in the gloom of a hillside—twenty
miles. Dan held the watch in his hand
now. He was calculating the time for every
move at the junction and the running-time
to the siding. Another mile and still
another and—Dan straightened in his seat
AT TIGER-TAIL SIDING.

as a man from whose shoulders a heavy
burden had been lifted. He replaced the
watch in his pocket. If the thing was ac-
cording to his understanding and they had
acted promptly, it must be over by now.
The lines on his face disappeared. The
mental strain was over.

  Rising from his seat, he removed the
cloth-wrapped bundle from the box.

   “Hey, Dick! ” he yelled, holding out the
package. “I don’t think there’ll be any
letter to pick up from Joe to-night, but you
can throw that for him at the sidin'. I
cal’late he'll need a right smart of that
black tobacco to steady up his nerves.”

   Down through the pass and on to the ap-
proach of the Tiger-Tail Bend, 17 rolled
with undiminished speed, although Dan
reached forward and placed a hand on the
air as he peered ahead for the lights of the
siding. Then, as he rounded the bend, he
straightened again.

  Ahead there appeared the headlight of
an engine on the spur, many lights were
swinging all clear, and 17 bolted through,
with a deafening roar and a blinding whirl
of lights and smoke and cinders, safe on her

way to the end of her run and a regained
schedule.

  There was much talk along the line of
how Dan Thomas, the veteran engineer and
one time telegrapher, had preempted the pre-
rogative of the despatches by ordering out
a special and posse from the junction-yards
to rout a band of train-robbers and clear
the switches before 377 swung through,
trailing the crack limited of the road in her
wake.

   The superintendent first learned of what
had really happened when he alighted from
his car at the junction. With a bound he
was off to find the engineer.

  “Dan Thomas, you’re a brick!” he ex-
claimed as he placed both hands on the old
veteran’s shoulders and looked him square-
ly in the face. “ You outgeneraled me,
Thomas, I’ll admit, but I won’t hold that
against you, for I take it you were playing
even for what I said about that cub at the
siding being asleep—and you won.

   “ Oh, by the way, Thomas," and Daniels
stopped as he turned to go; “I'm going to
take that ‘ cub ’ back to headquarters with
me. I need him.”

HIGH-SPEED DEVELOPMENT.

IT is not a matter of very great difficulty to trace
why the railroads of_ other countries have
further progressed in making minutes equal miles
than what has been accomplished here. The de-
velopment which the high-speed locomotive has
attained abroad, and particularly in England and
France, is largely due to the high plane occupied
by the motive-power department in the scheme of
organization which prevails in those countries.
The able men who are at the head of this par-
ticular branch of the scrvice arc free to work out
their ideas in practical form, and to remain un-
trammelled by the interference which too often
here renders the mechanical department subordi-
nate to a degree far out of keeping with its real
importance.

  The foreign motive-power chief is supreme in
his capacity. He reports only to the board of
directors, and he has large funds appropriated
annually for the sole conduct of experimental
work along the lines which might accrue to the
benefit of the service. Consequently, a thing which
is known to be good does not have to be aban-
doned merely on account of some incipient failure
in minor details, or when the costs commence to
run up without definite return. On the contrary,
the advantageous arrangement prevailing is such
that errors can be corrected and the entire scheme

slowly perfected until it is capable of doing better
work than the existing appliances.

  The mechanical department thus endowed with
positive authority, can afford to spend the money
in the necessary education of the men who will
handle any new type of power which it may have
evolved. In France, through an admirable sys-
tem of premiums, it rewards the engineers and
firemen for good work, as it just as effectively,
through a system of fines, punishes them for any
dereliction of duty. The principal effort, how-
ever, is to imbue these men with the spirit of
hearty co-operation, and the success of this laud-
able endeavor docs not fall far short in con-
stituting the real reason why the United States
has been outstripped in the speed question at
least.

  They have nothing to learn from us. but we
have much to learn from them in the conduct of
this particular feature, and until the position as
head of the motive-power department is endowed
with the dignity and given the latitude in the
way of expenditure which should properly be
associated with it. not to mention freedom from
interference, that department cannot be in a
position to assume the lead in working out these
world problems.—American Engineer and Rail-
road' Journal.
Running a British Railway

BY ROBERT H. ROGERS.

WHILE traveling through Europe in the interests of the Railroad Man’s
Magazine, Mr. Rogers did not spend all his time studying the opera-
tion of continental systems. After making the run from Paris to Calais
on the foot-plate of the wonderful De Glehn locomotive, told in our February
number, he crossed the channel and presented his credentials to the officials of
the great common-carriers of the British Isles.

     He was cordially received and, in a number of cases, was conducted per-
sonally through the yards and shops by the railway executives themselves, and
given the freedom of the engines on several well-known fast trains. In this
article Mr. Rogers gives a vivid pen-picture of the operation of a British rail-
road's mechanical department, pointing out every phase of the work as com-
pared with our own way of doing things.

     An American is inclined to smile when first he sees an English locomotive
with its incommodious cab and without headlight, bell, or pilot; but, as Mr.
Rogers points out, an English engine has no more use for these features than
a dog has for two tails.

The London and Northwestern Railway, Great Britain’s Banner Road, Com-
pared with an American Line in Engines, Shops,
and Labor Conditions.

^iformance and shop practise, amazing:
but I largely confined myself
to it while in Great Britain, because, with-
out a doubt, it is the best-developed rail-
road for its mileage not only in England
but in the entire world.

It is almost impossible to appreciate the
magnitude of the capital, equipment, and
operation which these 2,977 miles of road
can exhibit, a mileage, by the way, so small
from an American view-point that the road,
if in this country, would scarcely be classed
as one of our great railroad systems.

The London and Northwestern, how-
ever, is a marvelous enterprise, and before
telling you of its practical side, to study
which was my real mission abroad, some

to a journey to the sun. The tickets issued
during the last ten years, if placed end to
end, would make a belt around the earth
one and one-quarter inches wide. For each
of the London and Northwestern’s 3.000
miles of road, there is one locomotive, four
freight-cars, twenty-six passenger-cars, and
thirty men.

  A study of the perfection of detail which
must be attained to make all this possible,
should be of interest to railroad men in this
country, but it does not properly come with-
in the scope of this article, except in rela-
tion to the operation of the mechanical de-
partment. The intention herein is to tell of
how the engines are run, and how they are
taken care of in the roundhouses or “ run-
ning sheds”; features which become inter-
esting in comparison with our own procedure
in America.

  What is said of the London and North-
western in this regard is of equal applica-
tion to any railroad in England, where all
locomotive work is attended with pains-
taking care practically unknown in Ameri-
can practise.

Nothing Is Overlooked.

  I have rarely seen a British engine not
sufficiently clean for exhibition purposes.
There is never a leak about the valve-stem
or piston-packing, or about any of the cab-
fittings. The chief mechanical engineer
made me eventually understand that such
conditions would no more be allowed to
exist than to start an engine out only work-
ing on one side.

  After prolonged knocking around the
“running sheds” and riding on the locomo-
tives, I became satisfied that this spirit was
reflected throughout the entire mechanical
department.

  I would like to reciprocate the attention
bestowed on me by taking my informant

around a bit among some of our round-
houses, and he would note features of neglect
which he would find hard-to reconcile with
the capital invested. This is one-half, at
least, in explanation of the care which they
take of their equipment over there. To
them it is money, and it is practically
handled as such.

  Notwithstanding the cheaper labor and
material which prevail in England, en-
gines cost as much to build as they do in
this country. The workmanship is generally
superior and they are built to last.

  Although the London and Northwestern,
through changes in motive-power adminis-
tration and ideas, has “ scrapped ” more
engines in the past few years than any road
in England, they were still able to show me
engines in every-day service over thirty
years old. In this country, the rapid suc-
cession of new designs renders power prac-
tically obsolete for main-line requirements
in at least ten years.

The Largest Railroad Shop.

At the Crewe shops of this road I found

8.000	men employed in the locomotive de-
partment alone. This plant is unique in
the amount of manufacturing done. This
includes the making of boiler-plates, the
rolling of rails, the manufacture of steel
castings, signal and interlocking apparatus,
and a variety of other things used on the
road.

  This great works, the largest railroad
shop in the world, all things considered,
builds all the new engines required for the
London and Northwestern, and, in addition,
turns out about seventy new engines a year
for renewals. The painting of the new en-
gines is so thoroughly and beautifully done
that it becomes really the work of artists
instead of painters. It requires all of two
weeks, but does not have to be repeated for
six years. Fifteen months is the usual pe-
riod between general repairs.

  The men in the large repair-shops in
England are a comfortable lot. They take
life easily and impress the visitor as not
intending to work too hard. In fact, in go-
ing about the shops the men seem to be in-
clined to make the work last as long as
possible. This may be readily explained,
however, by the fact that piece-work is quite
common in England, and whenever the men
make one and one-third times their day-
rate, the price per job is reduced.
246

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

  This readily explains the “navy-yard”
pace of the shopmen. Their speed, limit
is set by the employers, and it is little won-
der that repairs are extravagantly expensive.

  English foremen are officials with con-
siderable dignity. I met several among
them who were technical-school graduates.
The workmen hold them in apparent awe,
which is in marked contrast with the de-
mocracy and freedom so characteristic of an
American railroad shop. The foreman in
that country is not “ Bill,” “ Fred,” “ Char-
ley,” or “Dick.” He is Mr. So-and-So,
and you mustn’t forget to touch your cap,
either.

  The “ works manager ” of an English
road is what he ought to be—a real official
with his duties confined to the shops them-
selves. English roads do not have the
counterpart of our master mechanics with
responsibilities of various kinds over shops,
roundhouses, engineers and firemen, wreck-
ing-crews, and what not, with far too little
help, and obliged to place dependence on
their general foreman for the important
shops.

  It will not be very long before the Crewe
works will turn out its five thousandth new
engine. Every effort is being made to have
this coincident with the coronation of King
George V, in view of the fact that 5,000
minus 2,967, (the present number of loco-
motives operated,) leaves 2,033 to be ac-
counted for which have lived their day on
the Northwestern.

Keeping a Fund.

  An admirable provision is made for the
maintenance of rolling-stock on English
roads generally by setting aside each year
a definite amount to be spent for this work.
This amount is increased from time to time
with the increase in the amount and ca-
pacity of the equipment, and it practically
forms a depreciation fund for keeping the
rolling-stock up to a uniform condition of
efficiency.

  It might be unfair if I said that the
Crewe shops are the best operated in Eng-
land, but I certainly thought them to be the
most interesting, because there is practically
nothing used by the railroad which is not
made there. The nearest counterpart in
such extensive scope in this country can only
be found on the Philadelphia and Read-
ing Railway, whose Reading shops manu-
facture everything, from pressed steel car-

shapes to locomotive boiler-tubes. This
shop has not purchased anything for repair
purposes in more than three years.

  Notwithstanding the appeal of the Crewe
shops to a railroad man, I was principally
attracted by the roundhouse end of the pro-
cedure. These “running sheds,” as they
are called, are all under the direction of the
“running superintendent.” Their conduct
is entirely apart from the supervision ex-
tended over the general repair and build-
ing-shops, such as Crewe represents.

  The Great Western’s “Family Tree.”

  In this connection the organization-plan
of a running department may be of special
interest.

  “ Chargemen ” are equivalent to foremen;
“fitters” are machinists; “boilersmiths”
are boilermakers, and “ chargemen shed-
men” are simply roundhouse labor-gang
foremen. “Tubers” are the men who calk
leaky flues, and “ tube-runners ” or “ flue-
blowers ” keep them clean between trips.
“ Fire-droppers ” are ash-pit men, pure and
simple, and “bar-layers” are those who
look after the maintenance of the grates
and attachments, or, as we call them in some
quarters, “gratemen.”.

  The diagram shows very clearly who
reports to who, and through it can be traced
the responsibility which leads ultimately to
the head of the running department.

  Upon the arrival at the “ running shed,”
the engineer and the hostler who relieves
him make a careful examination of the en-
gine. The former reports all defects before
going off duty. The engine is then left near
the coal-shed in charge of the coal-shed
hostler, who places it in proper position for
coaling.

  All of the work reported by the engineer,
and that subsequently discovered by the
“ running shed ” inspectors, is attended to
without fail. I have never known of a job,
which might still run a dozen trips without
causing any trouble, to be let go out with-
out receiving attention.

  It may be said that when these locomo-
tives back against their trains they are in as
good shape as human watchfulness and skill
can place them.

  An engineer need feel no uneasiness under
these enviable conditions. In the month of
May, 1910, there were but two passenger-
engine failures on the entire London and
Northwestern system.
RUNNING A BRITISH RAILWAY.

247

  After being coaled, the engine is taken
by the hostler to a point beyond the coal-
shed, where his helper, or a boy appointed
for the purpose, cleans out the smoke-box.
I thought this to be a painfully slow and
cumbersome operation. The smoke-boxes
should have drop-pipes, through which the
sparks could be dropped without the neces-
sity of any one entering the smoke-box.

  The engine then passes to the fire-track,
or ash-pit, where one fire-dropper stands on
the foot-plate and another in the pit. A
couple of grate-bars are either pulled up
by the former, or pushed up by the latter,
and through the opening in the grate thus
provided, the contents of the fire-box is
dropped into the ash-pan, from whence it
is raked into the pit.

  They don't seem to enthuse over drop or
dump-grates in that country, but they ap-
peal to me as being far more sensible than
this clumsy method, in which the grate-bars
have to be knocked out of place every trip.
It may be added that with very few excep-
tions the fire is always drawn 011 arrival.

  On completion of this performance, the
engine is taken into the “ running shed ”
to be “ stabled,” and to have the flues
cleaned out, the next item in the regular
routine which is never departed from. If
the shed is of the longitudinal type, which
is commonly used in England, with three
or four tracks running straight through it,
it become necessary to have the tubes “ run ”
or cleaned immediately, because after be-
ing placed in position another engine may
be put in front of it, rendering the operation
of tube-cleaning impracticable. If, how-
ever, the shed is round, similar to our round-
houses, the operation may be performed at
a time convenient to the “ tube-runners.”

Furbishing Up a Locomotive.

  To clean a set of flues requires from forty
to sixty minutes. I was much amused to
note that the flue-cleaner used the primitive
arrangement of a long rod with a piece of
canvas threaded into the end. I did not
see flues cleaned by compressed-air any-
where in England, although at Paddington,
on the Great Western, I did locate a system
of blowing them by steam, the latter being
furnished from a small vertical boiler.

  Next in order comes the wiping or clean-
ing of the engine. In the majority of Eng-
lish roundhouses each cleaner follows his
own engine, and gang-cleaning, such as

is universally followed in this country, is not
popular. Needless to add that this work is
performed witli scrupulous care.

  When ready for business, those engines
are things of beauty beyond dispute. Not
a single part is missed in the wiping, in-
cluding the brake-levers under the tender
and even the bottom of the ash-pan. This
is one of the time-honored institutions also,
and they would no more think of slighting
it than they would the work.

  After wiping comes the “bar-laying,”
in which operation the grates previously
knocked out to dump the fire are replaced.
This is done either by a long pair of tongs
from the outside, or by a boy who goes into
the fire-box and who, after putting them
into place, rakes off the accumulation of
ashes from the top of the brick arch.

  The “lighter-up” then throws a few
shovels of coal around the fire-box, and one
or two scoops of fire in the center, and the
locomotive is again ready for business. Qf
course there may be running repairs, such
as reducing brasses, applying packing, and
what not, which may further delay the en-
gine several hours, but what has been out-
lined is the inevitable procedure in connec-
tion with every engine which appears on the
coal-shed track. After all is finally com-
pleted it is set outside to make house-room,
exactly as in our own practise.

Some Amazing Wages.

  Labor is very poorly compensated in
English railroad shops, even when the
cheaper possibility of living is taken under
consideration. Skilled boilermakers and
machinists receive wages which in Ameri-
can money would amount to $1.68 for a
day’s work of maybe twelve hours, if it hap-
pens to be a “ running shed ” in which they
are working, and other occupations are not
nearly so well paid. In many instances,
engineers hauling the fastest express-trains
do not receive over two dollars for a round-
trip run lasting all day.

  On one occasion I came down from Glas-
gow to Carlisle on the engine of the London
West Coast Express, which is operated be-
tween the two cities jointly by the Cale-
donian and the London and Northwestern
Railways. This was a non-stop, round-
trip run from Glasgow to Carlisle, which
are 103 miles apart. The engine left Glas-
gow at 10 a.m., and returned about 7 p.m.
All the engineer received for that round-
248

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

trip was eight shillings, or $1.92, and his
fireman 4s. 6d., or $1.08.

  Imagine a man in this country running
a limited express-train 206 miles for $1.92.
On many of our roads such a run would
pay the engineer $8, while the fireman
probably gets $5.

  When that British engineer asked me
what a corresponding run would pay in my
own country I didn’t have the heart to tell
him the truth.

  Another thing, it is well to bear in mind
that engineers over there, as well as here,
are about the highest-paid skilled labor on
the railroad. If the above may be taken as
an average for their pay, and I believe it
may, as I made many inquiries along that
line, what of the minor occupations about
the “running sheds,” the “tube-runners,”
“ bar-layers,” “ lighters-up,” and so on?

  I do not believe that for unskilled labor,
that is, labor without a trade behind it, the
average pay is more than 4s. or ninety-six
cents per day.

  In “ running sheds,” where piece-work is
in vogue for wiping engines, blowing flues,
and other work which is going on all the
time, it is of course possible to make more
than this, but not a great deal more. I
mentioned in the beginning of this article
what happens to the piece-work rate as soon
as it becomes evident that big wages are
being earned.

  Engineers seem to be well content with
their pay and with their position. I have
been in many of their homes and they ap-
pear to live comfortably and enjoy life when
off duty, but I can’t understand how they
do it. The current story on this side of the
water that money will go three times as far
in England is a fallacy.

Divided into Classes.

  It is difficult to get the commonest kind
of a meal for eighteen cents. One fairly
decent is thirty-six cents, and a good one,
sixty cents. I imagine that if a railroad
man is caught away from home he buys the
eighteen-cent kind or goes without, because
he could not afford many of the others.

  These men should have more money. They
are divided into classes, and they are years
and years working up to a place in the first
class at the head of the fast express-trains.

  The through-freights, or “ goods ” trains,
are worked by second-class men, and most
of the long runs are what is called “ double

home,” although instead of doubling back,
which might be inferred from the designa-
tion, exactly the reverse is the case.

  For instance, on the Great Western Rail-
way, a train from Swindon to Exeter is
worked through to its destination, and the
crew takes rest at Exeter, returning to Swin-
don the next day on the balancing train.
The effect of this arrangement is that an
engineer and fireman must be away from
their home terminal at least three nights in
a week and must necessarily pay board, un-
less bunk-rooms are provided by the com-
pany, and I saw very few of them on Eng-
lish railroads.

  The local freights are worked by third-
class men, and are almost invariably “ single
home” jobs—that is, the men take rest at
their home station. Switch-engines are
worked by the lowest grade of engineers,
known as “turners,” or “pilotmen.”

Climbing the Ladder.

  In addition to switching, this grade does
most of the relief work, although at some
stations where the relief-men have to fre-
quently do long-distance work, third-class
men are employed. Relief work is of course
most irregular, and is provided for the pur-
pose of keeping the hours of the trainmen
within reasonable limits when trains are
running late, owing to fog, congested .state
of the road, or other causes.

  It struck me as being a long trip from a
fireman’s berth to that of a first-class en-
gineer. The firemen generally rise from
engine-cleaners, and pass through all of
the grades enumerated above, before getting
hold of the throttle of a switch-engine. On
some of the roads, the men firing the im-
portant trains are runners themselves, who
have been tempted to give up hauling a
freight-train for the shorter passenger hours,
even though the pay is less for firing than
for running.

  The actual running skill required to get
the fast British trains over the road on time,
did not impress me as being nearly so great
as that of the men who handled the De
Glehn compounds hauling the Paris-Ca-
lais boat-train on the French Northern Rail-
way. In the first place, the locomotives are
in perfect trim when delivered by the “ run-
ning sheds,” the road-bed is perfection, and
the block-signaling system is the finest in
the world.

In the majority of instances the engines

are of the two-cylinder simple-expansion
type, exactly as they are here, although a
great many of them are built with their
cylinders inside the frames and driving
a cranked main-axle, instead of being out-
side and driving the wheel through a crank-
pin. Compound engines are no longer popu-
lar in England, and since the retirement of
the late Mr. Webb, from the London and
Northwestern Railway, they have practi-
cally disappeared from that system.

   Consequently in the cab there is no be-
wildering complexity of detail, of which I
told you in connection with that wonderful
De Glehn engine, and which almost re-
quires a specially made man to get out of
it what it can give.

  These English cab interiors are quite
simple. Although, of course, somewhat dif-
ferently arranged than ours in accordance
with varying practise, the basic features are
the same, and you would have little trouble
in identifying them after a little study.
They are generally arranged to be handled
from the left side.

   The throttle, or “ regulator,” shoves down
in opening instead of pulling out, and the
reverse-gear generally - operates through a
screw-wheel. If the reverse-lever is used,
it has some supplementary device to assist
in throwing it over. They think that the
“ Johnson bar ” in our practise is too strenu-
ous a detail to cope with, and in many in-
stances which I can recall, I don't know but
that they are right.

   English locomotives are not disfigured
on the outside by pipes as ours are, as they
have their injectors and check-valves on the
back-head of the boiler in the cab. They
also use sight-feed lubricators, air-sanders,
and are about equally divided between the
Westinghouse automatic and the Eames
vacuum brake. They do not have bells,
head-lights or pilots, such devices being en-
tirely superfluous in view of the fact that
nothing can by any possibility get through
the thick edges which line the track on
either side.

In the Cab of the Northern Mail.

  I rode on the engine of the midnight
Northern Mail from the gloomy Euston Sta-
tion in London to Crewe, and I also rode
that of the famous West Coast Scotch Ex-
press, but I believe the former was the most
interesting experience. The train consisted
of thirteen mail “vans,” the contents of

which must be in Glasgow and Edinburgh
by late breakfast time, and those two cities
are 400 miles away.

  When we finally got under way with much
discordant clanking of safety-chains and
banging over switch-points, I knew enough
about railroading to appreciate that this
engine had a job cut out for her if she was
to get that three hundred tons of weight be-
hind her over the 158 miles to Crewe in only
three hours.

  It was dark as Erubus as we slipped
through the interminable suburbs of the
“city of appalling vastness.” There was
no moon, and as the worthy and prosperous
merchants who reside thereabouts retire
early, few lights other than the signal-
system illuminated our path. Nevertheless,
this energetic Precursor plunged valiantly
into the gloom, and with every revolution
of her big seventy-eight-inch drivers settled
down to a more businesslike stride.

  In less than twenty miles, however, I was
completely disillusioned in regard to the
oft-claimed easy-riding qualities of engines
in the land of beef and ale. This one cut
the most remarkable capers of any on which
I have ever ridden. Sometimes she would
lurch to the right, and instead of recover-
ing herself promptly, would apparently tear
off about three miles before again assuming
an even keel, and then the performance
would be repeated on the left side. Oc-
casionally this would be varied by an up
and down, or rocking-horse effect, which
created the impression that she was trying
to climb over something.

Not an Easy Rider.

  Finally, during a pleasing interval where
we appeared to skim easily through space,
with no rail-contact whatever, I ventured
to inquire of the principal gentleman in
charge the cause of such extraordinary gy-
rations.

  “ She hasn't got enough behind to hold
her down, sir,” he answered. “That
blawsted mail in the vans don’t weigh much,
ye know, and she hasn’t got enough to hold
her steady. She’ll cut up worse than that
going through ’Ampton ’Eath, sir.”

  I suppose we went through ’Ampton
’Eath, but I didn’t see it. There was no
seat on the fireman’s side of the cab which
I was occupying, and in trying to avoid
interfering with him, dodging hot injector-
pipes, and striving to keep from falling off
250

altogether in the presence of that peculiar
jump-effect, kept me in a perpetual dance
which would easily have put the efforts of
the Moki Indians to shame.

  Finally the driver beckoned me to cross
to his side, and indicated a nook wherein
I might stow myself behind the little shelf
on which lie sat. Several times subsequent-
ly 011 the run, I might add, I was constrained
to throw both arms around that ample
British waist in the manner of the lady who
became the bride of young Lochinvar, but
matters finally adjusted themselves.

  We stopped at Rugby and took on five
more mail-cars, and after that she steadied
down considerably. The lack of weight in
the train may have had something to do
with that weird motion, but I am rather
inclined to the opinion that it largely re-
sulted from the absence of equalizers on the
engine. They believe in hanging their clri-
ving-springs independently of one another,
a foolish practise, which if it were not for
the absolutely perfect track, would prevent
any one from living on the foot-plate of the
engine when at high speed.

  The run into Crewe was a wild dash of
about sixty miles in sixty-five minutes. On
that liome-stretch this thoroughly efficient
engine afforded a grand exhibition of what
machinery will do when it is right. The ad-
ditional cars taken on at Rugby did not oc-
casion her the slightest discomfort. There
were times when the speed reached easily
seventy-five miles per hour; an exhilarating
pace through the soft air of that English
summer night.

  Never once did the pointer on the steain-
gage vary five pounds from London to the
end of the run, and she burned a surpris-
ingly small amount of coal. One injector,
working constantly, but throttled about half
way down on water, kept the boiler fully
supplied. The engineer watched this feature
with unusual care, and was very clever in
maintaining the water in the glass to practi-
cally the same level from start to finish.

  With this exception there was nothing
unusual in his work, because these clever
engines do not require unusual ability to
keep them moving. The experience of that
trip brought it home to me conclusively that
English locomotive designers aim at a ma-
chine which will produce results when
operated with a minimum of intelligence.

  This is exactly the opposite of the ideas
prevailing across the channel, where, al-
though they put the stuff in the engine.

the engineer has to certainly work his points
to get it out.

  Maybe the English plan is the best after
all, despite my enthusiastic endorsement of
the De Glehn compound in a preceding
article. At high-speed the engineer is fully
occupied in watching the signals and the
water. Probably it would be just as well
not to bother him with the control of in-
dependent cut-off gears, variable exhausts,
receiver-control valves, and what not.

  I noticed particulauly that this English
engineer never took his eyes off the road
for a moment, not even when replying to
the few brief questions which I asked him,
whereas my friend in France was so con-
stantly occupied with adjustments and re-
adjustments of his controlling-gear that he
scarcely saw where he was going.

  The men in the cab on this mail-run
called every signal to one another in a dis-
tinct 'tone. The engineer would indicate
the color, and the fireman would affirm it,
or vice versa. Going into Crewe, where there
is an intricate interlocking system, the fire-
man gave his undivided attention to the
various semaphores, designating them by
letters.

  “All right on R.” “All right on X,"’
and so on went their calls. It was quite
evident that they were carefully trained to
keep a good lookout at all times; a feature
which has unfortunately not been well de-
veloped on French railroads.

  The heavy thinking is done by very few
men, and they are enormously compensated.
F. M. Webb, chief mechanical engineer, or
locomotive superintendent, of the North-
western, received for a salary £7,000, or
$35,000 per year. They are willing to pay
well a man who can think for his entire
department.

  It is practically unknown for a subordi-
nate official, not to mention the vast rank
and file, to take the initiative. The features
of personality and individuality which en-
dow American railroading with such a pic-
turesque aspect are entirely lacking in Great
Britain, because the men through the abso-
lutely inflexible system of organization must
be largely automatons.

  The general scheme is also a wonderful
example of absolute subordination, a sub-
ordination so complete that individual ef-
fort is seriously hindered, if not altogether
checked. The men are not naturally self-
assertive, as in this country, and could not
be, in the face of the prevailing systems.

out the cab-window and
sourly watched Brooks, the head brakeman,
line up the switch and give him a sign to
pull in on the siding.

  “Now we go into the hole here for that
special, which also means that we’ll prob-
ably be stuck for No. 1,” he growled, jerk-
ing open the throttle with a few more select
railroad expressions, while the 1646 picked
up the slack and slowly dragged the long,
heavy train in on the siding, leaving the
main line clear for the coming train.

  Baldy finished oiling around, and was
soon back on his seat-box.

“ I had a premonition that something

like this was due to happen just because I
wanted to be home early to-day,” he ex-
plained to Brooks, who was standing in the
gangway.

  “ Here I was aiming to attend the auc-
tion and buy those two lots adjoining mine,
and now I lose the chance to make a good
investment with the few dollars I’ve sweat-
ed and slaved for on this pike.”

  “ That sure is hard luck,” admitted
Brooks. “ I know the lots. They are a
good buy. But, say, why don’t you wire
the wife to go and put in a bid for you?
She knows what you intend to pay for them,
and might get them as cheap as you could.”

  “ I can see there is no hope for a man

My wife is one of the finest women in the
world, but she has as much right around
an auction as you'd have around a Sunday-
school.

  “But, speaking of premonitions, did
either one of you ever have a feeling that
something was going to happen while you
were out on the road, and then find that
it really did?” asked Baldy, reaching over
and lighting his pipe at the gage lamp.

  “No? Well, as long as we’re stuck here
for No. 1 and have half an hour to spare,
if you fellows will listen, I’ll tell you
about one I had many years ago that
changed the whole course of my life.”

  Baldy paused, and looked around to see
that his audience were in comfortable posi-
tions, and not apt to interrupt his remarks.

  “ I was just past my twenty-second birth-
day, and had a good job pulling freight out
in the Northwest, when I first meets Kate.
It was at a Saturday-night social up at
Easton, in the main hotel there.

  “The place was crowded, and I was
looking around for some one to dance with,
when Fatty Simmons waddled by with a
fine looking girl. The next time they came
by I grabbed Fatty and told him he re-
minded me of a circus where I had seen an
elephant and a Shetland pony doing a waltz
together, but some rube way - billed as a
fioor-manager butted in and told me to shut
up or get out.

  “ I never had any too much beauty, and
he was a good deal bigger fellow than I
was, so I shut up like a clam; but I kept
my eyes on the young lady, and in about
an hour I braced Fatty and asked him to
introduce me to his friend. He did it, all
right, and in a nice, neighborly way; but
she backed and filled like this old hog does
when she tries to pull a double train.

  “ Seemed to me as though she wasn’t stuck
much on meeting me or any of my friends
from the way she talked; but I used plenty
of sand, and stuck right with her until she
gave up in disgust and tried to see if she
couldn’t drive me away with sarcastic re-
marks. Finally, however, she turned real
friendly, and ended by inviting me to call
and see her at the hotel where she worked
for her uncle.

  “Faint heart never won fair lady, was
my reasoning; so I borrowed some money
from Fatty, and stayed over to accept the
invitation the next day before she was
troubled with a touch of forgetfulness.

   “ She was the one that held the switch-
 list in the lunch-counter department, and it
 worried me when I saw how she made the
 -rest of the girls get busy; for even then I
 was ready to ask her to be Mrs. Leonadis
 Knox, though I wanted to hold the switch-
 list and do some of the ordering around
 myself.

    “ I sat up on a stool and ate pigs’ feet
 at a nickel a throw until my money was
 gone, and I had to walk three miles to
 settle my stomach.

    “ When I got back to Ruckett my troubles
 commenced. I had missed my turn ‘ out,’
 and the 1 old man ’ gave me an awful call-
 ing down for not being on hand, and for
 not reporting a lot of work on the old bunch
 of scrap I was coaxing over the road at that
 time. Then, when I did report work, the
 crowd in the roundhouse overlooked it, and
 I had engine failures almost ever)' day.

   “ I- dreamed of Kate by night and I
 thought of her by day, while my fireman
 cussed and swore as he tried to fire and
 watch both sides for signals. The train-
 men got into a habit of throwing rocks and
 chunks of coal against the side of the cab,
 and some of them got fresh and slammed
 me with their wireless signals instead of
 the engine.

   “Matters went from bad to worse, and
 the old man called me in on the carpet and
 politely" but sarcastically informed me that
 I would either have to get over my crazy
 spell and marry, or look for a new job.

    “ ‘ I’m perfectly willing to be tied up for
 keeps,’ says I to him; ‘ but the young lady
 appears to be deaf, dumb, and blind when-
 ever I try to tell her about the new schedule
 I want to map out for her.’

    “ ‘ You’re dippy in the dome-,’ insinuated
 the old man, who was a whole lot married
 himself, if we could judge by the reception
 he received at home after a late session with
 the gang. ‘ A woman would sooner sit and
 listen to that kind of foolishness than to go
 to a swell cafe with a millionaire and eat
 shrimp salad and ice-cream.’

    “ It is always darkest just before dawn,
 according to some book of- rules; and I
 guess it’s right, for I had made at least ten
 trips to Easton without telling my tale of wo
 when, one day, Kate told me that she was
 going down to Woodland for a month’s visit
 to some friends. Woodland was at the other
 end of the division, and I would have plen-
 ty of time to see her. for I laid over there
 every third day.
BALDY KNOX’S PREMONITION.

  “ I put in all my spare time and a lot of
the company’s planning where and how I’d
pop the question and what I’d say, but the
month passed before I knew it, and I
stopped in on the last day of Kate’s visit,
determined to do or die. It makes me swear
when I think of it. I hadn’t been there five
minutes when the call-boy comes up and
calls me for an 4 extra, soon as ready.’

  44 Of course, I had to go. Kate walked
out to the gate with me, while, conversa-
tionally, I slipped and slid around like an
engine trying to pull through an inch of

  “From then on I attended strictly to rail-
roading, and we pulled into Oakland just
in time to run into one of those wind and
rain storms that-hit that part of the country
as regular as clockwork, and do their level
best to wash out the road-bed and throw
trees and telegraph-poles across the track.

  “ As we were coming through the upper
end of town I suddenly caught sight of
somebody out on the track with a lantern
swinging us down like a windmill. Think-
ing that the rails were blocked, I shot on
the air and stopped, but when the fireman,

soft soap, while she stood there with a teas-
ing smile and informed me that she intend-
ed to go up into Canada soon and keep
house for a brother who was lonesome and
needed her badly. I wanted to tell her
that I needed her more than all the brothers
in the world, but my tongue failed.

  411 never could remember how I told her
good-by, or how I reached the roundhouse.
We pulled out of town, all right; but the
first idea 1 got that we were not making
regular time was about six miles down the
road, when Seward, the conductor, comes
over the top of the train and asks me to
open her up a little, so that a farmer back
in the caboose can get to Ruckett before his
car-load of eggs hatches out.

Seward, and I got down and went ahead,
we did some tall cussing. A rube whose
hen-house had been blown over by the gale
had stopped us to keep the train from kill-
ing some of his chickens which were out on
the right-of-way running in all directions.

  41 We were some mad, I can tell you, and
we gave that fellow a tongue lashing he
probably remembered for some time.

  “The wires were down in jig time, and
the time-card badly twisted. We waited over
an hour, until No. 9, which was following
us, pulled in, and then the wire on the east
end came to life, and we got orders to run
as second No. 9 to Ruckett.

  44 First 9 had orders to meet No. 4 at
Auburn, forty miles west of Oakland, but

thought he would, and muttered:

' Oh, pshaw! Baldy, I know you can
make the time, but a feeling has hold
of me that I can't seem to shake off.
Somewhere up that pike,’ and he
pointed up the track with a scared
look on his face, ‘ I can see some kind
of a mix, and the thoughts of it are
worrying me more than I can tell
you,’ and, shaking his head slowly, he
walked back toward the caboose.

  “First No. 9 pulled out and went
kiting up the road, with Stover, the
engineer, shaking his fist at me. I
didn’t blame him much. Palmer was
down in a sag where he always let ’em
ramble to make time in getting to the
top of the hill, and slowing down to
let our flagman off would make him
lose a few minutes more. We fol-
lowed ’em right out, and the excite-
ment of getting started after Stover
knocked the nervous feeling out of me
until we were a few miles up the road.

  “ The road from Oakland to Ruck-
ett was about the cussedest and crook-
edest line that any half-witted sur-
veyor ever laid out. About sixty miles
on an air-line, I’d call it, while the
rails run for over ninety miles through
the roughest kind of country.

  “ Up a hill and down the other side
all the way, with the caboose still coming
down one side while the engine was poking
her nose up' the next one. Following up
and down the teeth of a saw is about the
nearest description I can think of.

  “Lake was the first station out of Oak-
land where a night office could be found,
and the thought of trouble worried me so
that I began to hope the wires would be
working by the time we reached there, and
tile operator would have the red light
against us. I eased off on the throttle
when we hit the lower end of town and only
too willing to stop, but the green light was
shining bravely in the semaphore over the
little shanty. I whistled twice for the board,
hoping to scare the operator into thinking
he had made a mistake, but the green still
loomed up like a headlight, and the oper-
ator only gave me a contemptuous stare as
we passed.

  “ Right out of Lake we hit a sleep down-
grade, and in all of my thirty years of life
on an engine I've never had a stronger no-
tion of quitting than I did right then and
there. Whether it was my morbid thoughts

no mention was made of us on account of
the order being put out before the wires
went down. Seward ordered the hind
brakeman to go out on first No. 9 and hold
No. 4 at Palmer, eight miles east of Au-
burn, in case we couldn’t make the time.

  “ I had seen all kinds of flagging in my
six years of railroading at that time; but
when Seward went back after the brake-
man, something sent a shiver of doubt over
me. I knew it was the proper thing to do.
but cold, clammy chills kept chasing up
and down my back.

  “ The fireman on the passenger was put-
ting out his green flags and lighting his
markers, and I was busy lighting the head-
light, when Seward came back to the en-
gine and told me to hike right out after
them and do the best I could. He stood
gazing off up the track, and I could see
something was worrying him, too.

  “•What’s eating you, Seward?’ I blus-
tered, in an attempt to get rid of my nerv-
ous feeling. ‘ Don’t vou think we will be
able to make the time? ’

  “Seward rose to the bait, just as I

or not, I don’t know; but somewhere in the
misty road ahead I could see a mixed-up
jumble of cars and an engine toppled off to
one side.

  “ I could see people moving around and
the steam arising from the wrecked engine
just as plain as I could see the front end
of the engine I was on. Every little fea-
ture was so distinct that I almost fell out
the cab-window as I felt myself leaning
forward to peer around the end of a car
to catch the number of the engine.

  “ I pulled myself together with a few
choice remarks to myself that explained
how many different kinds of a fool I was.
The next curve we hit I looked back as
usual to see if we had all the train, and
was just in time to see a fusee thrown off
the caboose.

  “ That settled it. It was easy enough to
see that the fireman was scared stiff — I
could hardly get him to stay in the cab at
all—I knew I was so rattled that I wanted
to get off the engine and throw up the job—
the bunch back on the caboose were troubled
with softening of the brain similar to my
complaint, or they wouldn’t be tossing off
fusees for a stop still six miles away. I
was still studying the matter over when we
spotted a faint light just as
we hit a straight stretch of
track about three miles
from Palmer. At first I
thought it was the embers
of a burning tree; but I
wasn’t taking any chances
that night, so I slammed on
the air and pinches ’em
down to five miles an hour
or less.

  “The fireman and I were
watching the light.

   “ When it c h a n g e d to
green we both gave a yell.

I stopped the string with a
jerk and whistled out a
flag. I looked back and
saw the flagman going back
and Seward coming up to-
ward the engine.

  “ I watched the light
flicker as it came slowly up
the track, and I might as
well tell the truth and say
I was a whole lot scared.

I’m not naturally a coward,
but things were a whole
lot mixed up that night,

I RAN FORWARD

and I wasn’t sure of anything but the fact
that every lunkhead on the train, myself
included, was expecting something unusual
to happen. Whatever it was, it looked to
me as though it was right on schedule time
and coming up the track to meet us. The
fireman was down on the step with a torch
held over his head, Seward’s lantern could
be seen bobbing along over the train, and
the hind man was hiking back up the track
with his red light. That was the only time
in my life that I ever envied a brakeman
his job.

  “ Seward came up and asked the fireman
what the trouble was, and I could hear his
snort of surprise when he looked up the
track. I crawled down where they were,
and we went into an excited discussion as
to why and what it was. Seward was of the
opinion that it was my place to walk down
the track and meet it, but I told him the
book of rules ordered me to stay with the
engine. Then we both agreed that the fire-
man should go, but the fireman didn’t see
it that way at all.

the fireman began to move back toward the
train. I was standing by the pilot-beam
with a hammer and monkey-wrench in my
hands. I knew the tools would be no pro-
tection against a ghost—but I had to have
something to hold on to. The light was
now a blur of white, similar to the way a
white barn looks in a dusky twilight, and
flashes of red and green light would be seen.

  “ Seward and the fireman had played tag
until they were two cars behind the engine.

  “ A cold, clammy perspiration was break-
ing out all over me, and I wanted to run
back with Seward, but was afraid to leave
the engine. I tried to lay the hammer down
on the pilot to take a chew of tobacco, and
was so nervous the hammer tapped away on
the iron like the sounder in a despatcher’s
office.

  “ The ghost was now just in the circle of
light thrown by the headlight. I picked up
the hammer, and was about to hurl it at
the specter when the spook suddenly let out
a series of cries with my name in each call.
I was nervous enough before, but when that
white thing began calling, ‘Lonny! Lonny!
Help! Help! ’ you can bet your pay-check
I was half crazy, and only weakness kept
me from running. Then it suddenly
dawned on me that it was a woman, and the
voice sounded like Kate’s. I ran forward
and caught her in my arms ju*t as she fell.

  “ It was Kate. Kate, with her hair hang-
ing down her back, her white dress covered
with dirt and marked with blood-stains from
gashes in her hands. How she came to be
there, or what the trouble was, did not enter
my mind. All I could think of was the
story I had tried to tell her so often, and
my voice started out like a phonograph with
the regulator broken.

  “ Seward came running up, and had to
grab me by the shoulder and shake hard be-
fore I could set the brakes on my tongue;
but I had already received my answer in the
way that Kate clung to me and sobbed out
her story. After I had left she had hurried
to the station and taken first No. 9 for
home, passing us at Oakland.

  “ Just outside of Palmer 9 had hit some-
thing. The crash was terrific. Several
trainmen had been killed, and no one re-
membered to flag. She had grabbed one of
the tail-lights and started back to meet us.
The light had two green sides and one red
one, which gave the flashes of both colors
as she changed the lamp from hand to hand.
We put her in the caboose and pulled on
into Palmer.

  “ That’s exactly just how I popped the
question and won my wife; but why we
were all so badly scared that night is
something that I’ve been trying to figure
out ever since.”

Questions
Answered
for
Men

DESCRIBE methods of taking the port-open-
ings and squaring the valves with the Young
valve-gear, which is so similar to the Wal-
schaert gear.

(2)	How are valves squared with the Baker-
Pilliod valve-gear?

(3)	Suppose the valve-travel on one side of an
engine was more than on the other side, how
would this affect the cut-off when the reverse-
lever was near the center of the quadrant?—T.

J. M., Havre, Montana.

(1)	Since the Young valve-gear can be driven
equally well by either the Walschaert or the Steph-
enson motions, any familiarity with the setting
of either motion will suffice in this case. In order
to obtain the port-openings, remove the valve-
chamber heads, whereupon the valves can be plain-
ly seen. The adjustment of any valve-motion, so
far as mere squareness is concerned, is dependent
upon the equal travel or motion nf the valve on
either side of a certain middle line, which must
necessarily be the center line of the exhaust-port.
Therefore, in the Young gear, simply mark the
valvc-stcm as the admission-port begins to open,
just as you would with any other gear. The idea
is to get marks on the valvc-stcm from which to
work, and these once obtained, the subsequent
procedure becomes easy.

(2)	The Baker-Pilliod valve-gear when prop-
erly constructed and adjusted to the locomotive,
passes outside of the pale of the constant con-

5 RR	257

 sideration of the engineer or mechanic. While
 liable, of course, to a certain amount of wear and
 inaccuracy, it is not subject to those erratic varia-
 tions so peculiar to some forms of valve-gearing.
 Generally speaking, the eccentric-rod is the only
 part that may occasion a renewal of adjustment, as
 the wear of the bearings at the main-crank or in
 the main driving-boxes may cause a slight varia-
 tion in point of length of the eccentric-rod.

   The gear reach-rod and eccentric-arm, as well
 as the valve-rod, are all fitted with means for ad-
 justment in regard to length, so that the equaliza-
 tion of the travel of the valve can be readily ef-
 fected in the original assembling of the parts.
 The amount of lead, or opening of the valve at the
 beginning of the stroke, can be increased or di-
 minished by lengthening or shortening the lower
 arm of the bell-crank.

   It will be readily appreciated that by lengthen-
 ing the arm of the bell-crank attached to the valve-
 rod connection, an increase in the length of the
 valve-stroke will be made, and this increase will
 be added to the amount of valve-opening at the
 end of the piston-stroke. A corresponding de-
 crease will occur in the case of shortening the
 bell-crank arm.

   These organic changes are seldom required, and
 it is questionable whether in the instance of a
 change in the amount of valve-opening being
 necessary it would not be advisable to make a
258

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

change in the combination-lever. By shortening
or lengthening this lever, the stroke of the valve
will be affected in a lesser degree.

  In brief, assuming that the design of the valve-
gearing is correct, the adjustment of the parts is
a matter comparatively easy of accomplishment,
and the contrivance, when once adjusted, has the
rare quality of retaining that degree of accuracy
which approaches as near perfection as can be
expected in the strenuous aggregation of diverse
forces which have their being in locomotive service.

  We might add for your information, that the
original Baker-Pilliod valve-gear, to' which your
question no doubt refers, has now been consider-
ably modified and improved, and many slight de-
fects in the old gear have been successfully elimi-
nated. In its new form it has recently been ap-
plied to several high-speed locomotives of the
Central Railroad of New Jersey, and other roads
have spoken quite highly of it in high-speed
service.

  (3) Under the conditions which you mention,
the steam will follow the piston farther on the
side with the longest valve-travel, irrespective of
the position of the reverse-lever, except that the
discrepancy will probably be more in evidence
with the lever closer to the end of the quadrant.
If the error is sufficiently great, it will cause the
valves to beat very much out of square, and it
should be corrected by raising the side of the
valve-motion which swings the longest; that is.
of course, after the travel has been equalized on
both sides. This adjustment may be made either
by shortening the link-hanger or by putting a liner
of proper thickness under the rocker-box of the
long side. It is difficult to give any rule for the
exact amount which the hanger should be short-
ened, or the rocker-box raised, as they are opera-
tions in which past experience proves the best
teacher. It is said that one-sixteenth alteration
in the hanger means a difference of one inch in
the cut-off, but it would be better to prove it for
yourself.

  As the proper answers to your various questions
require unusual space, we are holding Nos. 4 to 7,
inclusive, until the next issue.

WHAT other roads in addition to the New
York Central, the Pennsylvania, and the
Baltimore and Ohio run their trains by
block-signals?

  (2)	When trains are run by block-signals,
does the despatcher control the road as he would
with train-orders?

  (3)	What roads use Prairie type locomotives
to any extent?—G. C. B., Clinton, Iowa.

  (1)	There are very few roads to-day on which
the block-system is not employed in one of its
varied forms — automatic, controlled manual,
staff, or telegraph block. The latter is presumed
to be least advanced of modern signaling, and is
about the least in evidence among the different
systems. If you are particularly interested in
what has been done and what remains to be ac-

complished in block-signaling, you can obtain a
great array of statistics by addressing the secre-
tary of the Interstate Commerce Commission,
Washington, D. C.

  (2)	Yes, the train-despatcher is always in evi-
dence, no matter whether block-signals are present
or not. About all the latter do is to help him out
in his work, but there can be no relaxation of the
eternal vigilance which has become the slogan of
successful and safe railroad operation.

  (3)	The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe,
Take Shore and Michigan Southern; Chicago,
Burlington and Quincy; Northern Pacific, Great
Northern, and the Wabash railroads seem to favor
engines of the Prairie type.

at present. It extends from Salt Lake City, Utah,
to San Francisco, California, about 950 miles.
The master-mechanic of this road is T. M,

there are no actually new railroads under way,
but many surveys have been completed for ex-
tensions to existing lines, and track-laying is be-

however, are of sufficient scope to necessitate any
recent appointments to existing organizations.

ARE car-loads of freight routed via rail and
lakes, transferred at Buffalo; or, are the
cars themselves ferried across the lakes?

  (2)	When was the first railroad opened be-
tween Baltimore and Philadelphia, and what was
its name?

  (3)	When a train is being helped by a pusher-
engine how is a sudden stop made?

  (4t Did you ever publish an article on the
freight-claim department?—J. L. C., Baltimore.

  (1)	The Pere Marquette car-ferry is across
Lake Michigan, and handles much freight in that
direction without unloading. At Buffalo, the
freight is generally transferred, although we be-
lieve that there is a car-ferry in operation between
Lewiston and Toronto.

  (2)	The Philadelphia, Wilmington and Balti-
more Railroad was completed in 183S, but the
Susquehanna River was not bridged until 1862.
Previous to that time the road was operated in
two sections: from Baltimore to Havre de Grace,
and between Port Deposit and Philadelphia. The
Baltimore and Port Deposit Railroad, which was
the primary link in the through line to Philadel-
phia, was finished to Havre de Grace in 1837, and
formally opened on July 6 of that year. - Sleeping-
cars were operated on the Baltimore-Philadelphia

line as early as 1838. They were so constructed
that the seats used in day-travel could be converted
into two or three tiers of comfortable berths. In
addition to these, the company adopted, in 1847,
reclining-chair cars for its trains running at nights.
A few years ago the name of the road was
changed to the Philadelphia, Baltimore and Wash-
ington Railroad, and it is included in the opera-
tion of the Pennsylvania Railroad system.

HOW is a switch worked so that when the car
approaches within about three feet of it
it is automatically thrown? It is located
on a steep grade, one track continuing on straight
and the other turning off at an angle.—C. McK.,
Pittsburgh.

  For light steam or dummy roads, electric roads,
or wherever the rolling stock can use heavy curves,
automatic switches can be arranged at turn-out
points to be thrown by the locomotive itself. The
point-rail, as ordinarily arranged in these devices,
is held by a housed spring in about the center of
a cross-tie at the point. This spring cloges the
switch after each wheel-flange passes by, the ac-
tion being similar to that of the hinge-rail of a
spring rail-frog. Not many of these are in use;
in fact, you will have to make quite a search to
find any mention of them in standard works on
tracks. We are unable to give any information
in regard to the switch which you describe, as
it is a locally contrived affair which those using
will no doubt explain to you.

  (1)	The Mikado type has a two-wheel truck,
eight connected driving-wheels, and a trailer;
hence, 2-8-2, according to Whyte’s classification,
which has been adopted in this country for loco-

  (5)	How long is the railroad-bridge across
Salt Lake in Utah?—F. B. S., Monessen, Penn-

  (1)	The “ 700” engines on the Baltimore and
Ohio were originally of the 8-wheel American
type (4-4-0), with short fire-boxes. They were
all sizes, however, and there is some variation in
the driving-wheel diameters. It is recalled that
those numbered from 752 to 775 had a 69-incli
wheel, while it was very much lower under the
796 and others, but 68 inches would about repre-
sent the 700 class. There is a difference also in
the 1300 class in this regard. The first of these,
numbered from 1300 to about 1307, were built in
1S92. They were assigned for the heavy-grade
work on the Baltimore and Ohio, between Keyser

and Grafton. West Virginia, and had a 66-incli
wheel. The next few engines of the 1300 class,
which are all 10-wheels (4-6-0), had 72-inch
drivers. The 78-inch drivers begin about with
engine 1320 and run up to 1336. These latter
engines were employed for many years in the fast-
trains service between Washington and Phila-
delphia. Some of them were originally compound-
engines, but since then simple cylinders have been
applied, and many of the rebuilt engines are still
in that service. The 2100 class (4-6-2) all have
74-inch driving-wheels.

   (2)	Track-troughs for scooping water while

to build. It sweeps away 43.77 miles, eliminates
3,919 degrees of curvature, and 1,515 vertical
feet of grade, cuts down the running-time of the
fastest train fully two hours, and, through its
practically gradeless route, increases the tonnage
movable per horse-power almost beyond power to
calculate. The total length of the cut-off, from
Ogden, Utah, to Lucin, Nevada, is 102.91 miles,
while the former route around the head of the

so far as possible the requirements of the future.
The area of the station and yard is 28 acres, and
in this there are 16 miles of track. The storage-
tracks alone will hold 386 cars. The length of
the 21 standing-tracks at the station is 21,500
feet. The station building is 7S4 feet long and
430 feet wide. The average height above the
street is 69 feet, while the maximum is 153 feet.
To light the building requires 500 arc, and 20,000

      B., and others. New York City.—We do not
know of any concern shipping railroad
men to South America. As we have often said be-
fore, we cannot too strongly advise against a rail-
road man giving up a good job in this country to

experience. It is our opinion that you will then
give up the idea.

GIVE methods for obtaining degrees of curves.
—B. E. B., Ralston, Nebraska.

   The simplest way of describing a railroad curve
is by giving, the length of the radius, i. e., the
distance from the center to the outside of the
circle, or one-half the diameter. The shorter the
radius the sharper the curve. The length of the
radius is usually stated in feet. English engineers
often state the radius in chains (1 chain = 66
feet). The length of the radius of a railroad
curve is measured to the center of the track.

   Civil engineers designate railroad curves by de-
 grees, using the sign ® for degrees and 1 for
 minutes, there being 60 minutes in one degree.
 The exact length of radius, which, with an angle
 of one degree has a chord of 100 feet, is found to
 be 5729.65, feet. For the sake of convenience.
 5,730 is generally taken as the radius of a one-
 degree curve. If the angle at the point of the
 “ V ” is two degrees and the sides are prolonged
 until 100 feet apart, the length of each side is
 (almost exactly) one-half as long as when the
 angle is one degree, or J/> of 5,730—2.S65.

  For a three-degree curve, the radius is one-
third of 5,730, and so on. For perfect exactness,
the length of 100 feet should be measured, not
along a straight line connecting the ends of the
“ V,” but along the line of the circle of which the
sides of the “ V’’ are radii; i. c., the arc should
be used and not the chord.
BY THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN.

261

    The difference, however, is so slight, for any
  curves ordinarily used on main lines of standard-
  gage railroads, as to be ignored in practise. For
  extremely sharp curves, of say 100 feet radius or
  less, it is usual to express the curve by feet radius
  rather than by degrees. A very simple method of
  finding degree of curvature without mathematical
  calculations, is to run out 62 feet of a steel tape,
  and stretch it between two points against the in-
  side rail on the curve. Then measure from the
  exact center of the tape, the 31 foot mark, to the
  edge of the inside rail, and this distance in inches
  ■ represents the degree of curvature.

    You will have to make our other question re-
  garding “ expansion-plugs" between rails more
  explicit before we can attempt an answer.

HOW dofife a locomotive work?—F. E. C.,
Toledo, Ohio.

    We cannot reply to this as briefly as you have
  propounded the question, and we are somewhat
  at a loss how to answer you at all. We don't
  know how much elementary knowledge you pos-
  sess in regard to a locomotive. However, we will
  do the best we can.

    The steam-locomotive consists of a boiler and
  engine, mounted on a frame which is supported
  on wheels, the latter being turned by the engine.
  The boiler contains water, and has a fire-box,
  forming part of it. in which fuel is burned to
  supply heat to the water and convert ii into steam.
  The steam passes through a valve, called a throt-
  tle-valve, thence through pipes to the steam-
  chysls; from which valves, operated by a con-
  nection from the main-shaft or axle, automatic-
  ally admit it alternately to each end of the cyl-
  inders, and exhaust it therefrom into the atmos-
  ^phere through the exhaust-pipe and stack.

   The expansive force of the steam moves the
 pistons, piston-rods, and cross-heads back and
 forth, and as the cross-head moves in guides, and
 has one end of the main-rod connected to it at the

wrist-pin, while the other end of the main-rod is
connected to the crank-pin on the driving-wheel,
the reciprocating motion of the piston is thereby
changed into the rotary motion of the driving-
wheels. This description could, of course, be elabo-
rated in detail to fill a dozen magazines the size
of this, but the above may suffice to give you an
idea. You might read to advantage “ How a Loco-
motive Boiler Works,” and “ The Inside History
of a Locomotive,” which appeared in The Rail-
road Man’s Magazine, September and October
1907, respectively.

1HAYE argued that locomotive driving-wheels
arc cast and have a steel tire; and that the
freight-car wheels are made of cast iron. Is
this right? 1 would like to know whether there
is any wood-fiber under locomotive-tires, and if
there is a wood-fiber driver in existence.—G. P.,
New York City.

  You are right in both contentions. Locomo-
tive driving-wheels may be of cast iron or cast
steel, the latter being now in more general use.
Both have a steel tire which is bored somewhat
smaller than the wheel, and then heated to secure
the expansion to get it on. The contraction when
cold ordinarily serves to hold it, but in many
cases additional safeguards are employed, such as
tire-retaining rings ancl set-screws passing through
the wheel-rim between the spokes and into the
tire.

  Wrought-iron wheels for locomotives have been
used in England, and, no doubt, many may be
found there yet. Their construction is decidedly
interesting in view of the fact that it requires
many sections welded together to form a wheel,
and the completed job represents about the highest
development of the blacksmith's art. Freight-car
wheels in this country are always of cast iron,
without tires, but the tread is chilled or hardened.
Wood-fiber is not used as you suggest.

  The Baldwin Locomotive Works has turned out
close to 60 engines in a single week. Even then,
probably, the capacity of the plant was not fully
tested.

HAS the Pennsylvania Railroad any engines
of the Pacific type larger than the 2115

  (2)	Which engine do you consider the speed-
iest of the two types, the American (4-4-0) or
the Atlantic (4-4-2)? Equal size drivers, cylin-
ders, etc.—H. C. V., Pittsburgh.

  (1)	The Baltimore and Ohio engine 2115, of
the 4-6-2, or Pacific type, weighs 229,500 pounds,
while the heaviest Pennsylvania of the same type
has a total weight of 272,500 pounds. The Penn-
sylvania engine is also some 33,000 pounds heavier
on drivers. The tractive effort of the Baltimore
and Ohio engine, however, is in excess of this
monster, and under even conditions it should
prove as efficient.

American, or 4-4-0 type, that is, a 4-wheel lead-
ing-truck, and 4 connected drivers with no trailer.
The addition to this wheel arrangement of a
single rear-truck, behind the drivers, converts the
American into the Atlantic, or 4-4-2 type. Al-
though there should be very little difference, if
any, in speed under the equal conditions which
you mention, it would be in favor of the Atlantic
type, as the small rear or trailing-truck permits
the fire-box to be greatly widened over the 4-4-0.
Consequently, with larger grate area and heating
surface, there would be more assurance of con-
tinuous high-steam pressure, which is a most im-
portant factor in the consideration of high loco-
motive speeds. It might be added that the At-
lantic type is recognized as the high-speed engine
in both this and foreign countries where the load
behind the tender is in keeping with its capacity.

  In regard to the other question in your letter,
the comparison between Baltimore and Ohio 2115
and Baltimore and Ohio 1441 and 1451; although
we have the completed dimension figures on 2115,
we regret very much that they are not at hand at
this writing for the 1441. These tabular com-
parisons which you request are always very in-
teresting, and it is our intention to give them in
that form whenever wanted. If it will be of any
value to you, however, without the tabulated data,
we can say there is little comparison possible
between the two engines mentioned and the big
Pacific 2115. They are Atlantics (4-4-2), and
are much lighter than the latter. We will publish
the dimension-table^next month, and you may
draw your own conclusions. You need not apolo-
gize for your interesting letters, as we are glad to
hear from you at any time. The harder the nut
you give us to crack the better we like it. If we
don't know ourselves we happen to be so fortu-
nately fixed that we can soon get in touch with
some one who does.

  (1)	The success of a trip over a division de-
pends very much on how the' start is made. A
fireman with an interest in his work should reach
the engine soon enough before starting-time to
have the fire in the condition most favorable to
making steam for the start. A hard and fast line
cannot be recommended, because the conditions
under which the start is made must influence to
a great extent the kind of fire that must be on the
grates. A heavy, hard-pulling train starting upon
an ascending grade through the street of a town
and long yards, will call for a fire different from
that which is necessary when the train is light,
and easy grades are met at the start without yards
and streets that demand the fireman’s attention
to signals. At all events, when the train is ready
to start there should be a glowing fire on the grates
of a depth sufficient to keep up steam until after
the reverse-lever has been notched back and the
train worked into speed.

  (2)	The good fireman maintains the fire in a
condition to suit die work which the engine has
to do. At parts of the road where the grades
materially increase the work to be done, he makes
the fire heavier to suit the circumstances. This
is done gradually and not by pitching a heavy
charge into the fire-box at one time. This system
of steady firing keeps the temperature of the boiler
as even as possible, and has the double result of
being easy on the boiler and using the fuel to the
best advantage. The fire should be maintained
nearly level and the coal supplied so that the sides
and corners of the fire-box are well filled, for
there the liability to drawing air is most imminent.
BY THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN.

263

With this system closefy followed, (here should
be no difficulty in keeping up a steady head of
steam.

  (3)	When a hole appears in the fire it should
be promptly located and filled, either by throwing
lump-coal into it or by leveling the fire to cover
it. It is, of course, apparent that the presence
of a hole concentrates the draft largely in that
quarter and has a most detrimental effect on the
combustion which should be going on uniformly
all over the grate-bars.

  (4)	The blower should be used principally to
carry off the smoke, which has a tendency to trail
when the engine is shut off. It can best be pre-
vented by refraining from putting in fresh coal for
a few moments before the throttle is closed. Other
uses for the blower will from time to time suggest
themselves to any observant fireman. The blower
should not be left on any longer around stations
than is absolutely necessary. In addition to the
discomfort occasioned by its noise, it will blow
away considerable steam at the pops.

  (5)	When approaching a stopping-place, the
fireman should be careful to have a sufficiently
heavy fire prepared as a preliminary, so that he
will not have to commence firing until the start is
made. If this has been neglected, however, it is
better to throw in a fresh supply of coal while the
engine is standing at the station. The common
practise of throwing open the door and com-
mencing to fire as soon as the throttle is opened
is very hard on the fire-boxes, because the cold
air drawn through the door strikes the fire-box
sheets and tubes, contracting the metal and tend-
ing to produce leakages. Firing just as a train is
pulling out of a station is bad for another reason.
At that time, the fireman should be assisting the
engineer in looking out for the signals.

  (6)	It depends entirely on the conditions of
the road and run. If other grades are to be sur-
mounted, care must be taken that the fire does
not burn down too low for the hard pull to come.
This is a point where your experience will form
a better guide than anything we can say here.

          Clifford Tells a Story and Love Finds
          a Way To Unite Three Happy Hearts.

CHAPTER XVI.
Love’s Demands.

GENUINE acknowledgment of
love is never, lost on a sin-
cere woman. Elaine Aldyce
felt in the innermost re-
cesses of her heart that
George Clifford meant every
word that he had uttered on the deck of the
Titan.

  There was something in his tone and
manner that precluded any possibility of
doubt. George Clifford loved her. Of that
there was no gainsaying.

  The question that rankled in her heart
was whether or not she loved him. Love,
to her, was the purest and holiest condition
.that a united man and woman could know.
It should exist as strong in the one as in
the other. There should be no doubts. The
woman should not only be sure of the man,
but sure of his love.

  The man should not only be the lover and
protector of the woman, but know that she
has found in him the ideal of her fancy—
for it is on fancy as much as character and
will that a woman builds her love.

  Then, too, it was for life—life so far as
she would know it. She recalled the words
of her dear dead mother—a woman who was
a wife and a mother in every sense of that
holy combination. Her mother had said:
“When you marry, my daughter, be sure
that you love—be sure that you love. That
is the only basis on which a girl should
marry.”

  All this, and a thousand and one more
thoughts, flashed through Elaine’s mind
as she tore herself from George Clifford’s

arms and ran like a startled deer to her
stateroom.

  One or two of the belated passengers saw
her and noticed the strange look on her face
as she passed them, but they simply sur-
mised another case of seasickness and an
overcome lady hastening to the confines of
her stateroom.

  Once inside, she hastily removed her hat
and coat. As the great tears welled to her
eyes and blinded them, she threw herself on
her bed and wept.

  For a long time her sobbing might have
been heard by any one passing her door.
She seemed to be able to do naught but cry.
Then the tears gave way to thoughts—
thoughts and thoughts and still more
thoughts that would not down came crowd-
ing into her brain.

  This was the first time in her life that a
man had proposed to her. It came as a
shock to J:he girl—for her life had been lived
outside of such idea. When it does come to
such a girl it is a matter of the most serious
import. It affects her whole life.

  Sleep soon calmed the troubled girl—
sleep without dreams or qualms—and when
she awoke the stream of sunlight that illu-
mined her room made her sit up and mar-
vel. She arose and looked in the glass at
her red and swollen eyes.

  “What a sight!” she said, womanlike,
and then she set about her toilet, for she must
appear on deck soon and—oh, how would
she tell May Pierce!

  There came a soft knock at the door.

  Elaine opened it cautiously. A white-
capped stewardess stood outside.

  “Miss Aldyce,” she said, “Mr. Clifford
wishes te-know if you will take breakfast
with him and Miss Pierce in the restaurant.”

  The three fellow travelers had been ac-
customed to take their meals together in the
regular saloon, and an invitation to the res-
taurant was a little out of the ordinary.
Many of the modern ocean liners have an
a la carte restaurant in conjunction with
the regular dining-saloon, where passengers
may go at will at any hour of the day or
night.

  Elaine hesitated a moment. She could
not quite comprehend why George Clifford
should have sent such an invitation.

  “ Oh, I don’t think—I really don’t think
that I will take breakfast this morning,” she
said hesitatingly. “ Tell Mr. Clifford that
I shall not take breakfast this morning. I
will meet him and Miss Pierce later for
luncheon.”

  The stewardess departed, and Elaine
turned to make herself presentable. But in
a little while she was interrupted by the tele-
phone in her stateroom.

  She placed the receiver to her ear. The
musical tone of George Clifford’s voice
greeted her.

  “ Do accept my invitation—Elaine.”

  He hesitated before speaking her name.

  She did not reply.

  “ Elaine,” he repeated lower, “ don’t you
hear me ? ”

   “ Please don’t,” she said.

  “Won’t you accept my invitation?” he
asked.

  “What for?” she asked—and she knew
not why she should make so foolish a re-
mark.

  “ Breakfast in the restaurant,” he said.
“ I want you to come at once.”

  “ Commanding—already! ” she answered
as her voice broke into a ripple of laughter.

  Clifford would have given worlds if he
could have taken her into his arms at that
moment.

  “ Why won’t the regular saloon do ? ” she
asked.

  “ Do! ” said George, with some emphasis.
“ It has been closed for an hour. You must
remember that you have been sleeping over-
time to-day. Miss Pierce and I have been
pacing the deck, waiting for you. If you
don’t come soon, I’ll devour the anchor-
chains. I’m as hungry as a starved wolf.”

  “ I didn’t think that I would take break-
fast this morning,” said the girl.

  “Nonsense,” replied Clifford. “You
must come. We will wait fifteen minutes
for you. Meantime I will go to the steward
and order. Besides, Elaine, the English

coast is on our bow, and by the time that
breakfast is over it will be in splendid view.
Now, Elaine, don’t be foolish. Come as I

wish.”

  There was something in his voice that
seemed to assure Elaine that she should go.

  Heretofore she had been immune to such
pleading. Nobody could make her do any-
thing against her wishes. Now she felt that
it was her desire—nay, her duty—to say that
she would do what he so earnestly requested.
Some inner motive that had never before
manifested itself in her being seemed to be
saying, “Yes, yes, yes!” and ere she was
aware of it she had said “ Yes ” so clearly
and audibly that there could be no mistaking
her meaning.

  “Good! ’’ Clifford’s voice had the ring of
real delight. “Miss Pierce and I will
meet you at the entrance to the main sa-
loon. Don’t be long. Think of my ter-
rible hunger.”

  Elaine’s fifteen minutes grew into twenty
and even thirty before she did put in an ap-
pearance.

  She had dressed with lightning-like
rapidity, but when the final moment came
for her to leave her stateroom and face the
man who the night before had asked her to
be his wife the strain was a little too much.

  Just how many times she tried to open
the door and step into the passage she could
not tell. For moments she sat, trying to
muster her courage. She knew that George
would be calling her again—and, then, his
appetite! She should have some considera-
tion for that!

  George Clifford was on the verge of start-
ing to telephone a second time, when he and
May Pierce chanced to glance up the wide
staircase that led down to the main saloon.
They looked just in time to see Elaine—a
queen in her simple stateliness—hesitating
at the top step.

  Clifford thought she had never looked so
glorious before. She was attired in a pretty
morning gown; a jaunty hat was set nat-
tily on her well-combed hair; she seemed to
be the allegory of womanly perfection.

  She turned her head away for a moment,
and then started down the stairs. Then her
eyes caught those of George Clifford, and her
face lit up with a smile that was a radiant
beam of glory.

  Clifford responded with a reassuring
smile that dispelled her fears as the morning
sun dispels the shadows.

  She knew that awful danger—the danger
2GG

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

of meeting him face to face—was over. His
smile set her at ease.

  He arose and held out his hand. She took
it, and looked straight into his face; but, as
he pressed her hand with all the warmth of
heartfelt assurance, she blushed just the
daintiest crimson and turned away.

  “Miss Pierce and I are starved to deadi,”
said Clifford. “You wait with her a min-
ute, and I will see if breakfast is ready.”
He darted into the restaurant. The girls
were left alone for a moment. Keen is the
perception of woman—aye, keener and more
penetrating than that of man. Although
Clifford had not divulged to May Pierce—
either by look or word or sign—even the
slightest hint of the understanding that had
arisen between Elaine and him, its truth
flashed into her mind.

  As Clifford dashed to the restaurant, May
took her friend’s hand.

  “ What a beautiful morning! ” said
Elaine.

  But two and two and four and four and
eight and eight had been dashing through
May Pierce’s brain, and each addition was
just what she anticipated it would be. She
didn’t heed the time-worn remark about the
weather, but, looking Elaine straight in the
eye, she said:

  “Elaine—Elaine—I think I know why
you are so late this morning.”

  “ Why, May, dear—”

  “Oh, Elaine, may I—” She drew close
to her chum and whispered with every atom
of sincerity:

  “ I congratulate you.”

  Elaine tried to brush away a tear. There
was no use denying. May was a woman,
and therefore she knew. Had she been a
man, Elaine would have answered. But
“ you can’t fool a woman,” and no one knows
that fact better than a woman.

  Most of the passengers were on deck at
the time, peering into the clear offing where
the sharp outline of old England’s coast was
growing more perceptible with each revolu-
tion of the boat’s propellers. The few who
were below at the time, and happened to see
two pretty young women in each other’s
arms, hugging and patting and kissing,
might have been a bit surprised; but they
were no more surprised than George Clifford
when he returned to escort them to the res-
taurant.

  He knew, the moment he saw them, that
the cat was out of the bag. At heart he was
not sorry, for it would divert the conversa-

tion to the subject that was foremost in his
mind—and, too, it was evidence that Elaine
had taken him seriously.

   “ I congratulate you, too,” said May, of-
fering Clifford her hand. “ I congratulate
you. You have got the very best girl in all
the world! ”

   “ Oh, I haven’t accepted him yet! ” Elaine
said almost aloud, and then looked around,
fearing that some one had heard her.

  “ Oh, but I—” Clifford hesitated.

  “ A woman always has the privilege of
changing her mind,” said Elaine.

  But there was something in her smile and
in the look that came into her eyes that
made him understand that she wouldn’t.

  No matter how pleasant a trip at sea
may be, no matter how jolly the journey,
or how fine the weather, the sight of land is
always welcome. The vast ocean, as ob-
served from shore, fills one with awe. Its
power and majesty are difficult to compre-
hend, and frequently the observer looks at
it with a touch of fear. But the sight of land
from the sea is an entirely different matter.

  One looks upon it as an old friend. It
seems to hold out some welcoming, cheering
hope, and as it grows from a dim, darkened
outline—as the ship approaches—until it
takes the more visible form of mountains
and valleys, with cities nestling here and
there, it seems to assure us that we belong to
it, and not to the vast stretches of water that
surround it.

  Something of this sort stirred the heart
of Elaine. When the trio went up to the
hurricane deck, after the rather elaborate
breakfast which Clifford had ordered and
which partly served as a feast to celebrate
the engagement—although Elaine said that
she would not as yet give her consent—
the green cliffs of the British mainland were
plainly to be seen.

  The passengers were all on deck now.
Those who thought that they knew were
pointing out spots of interest. V

  The big boat had the currents and the
tide in her favor. As the land loomed
larger, she seemed to move faster. Before
the day was more than three hours past the
noon, the Titan was inside the harbor.

  Elaine had stood on one side of George
Clifford and May on the other. Every new
thing that came to their view caused them
all the joy of the traveler who is making
his journey for the first time.

   Finally the Titan was ready for the dock.
THROUGH BY SUNRISE.

267

She was slowly nosing into the little harbor
studded with all manner of craft. More
busy than all the rest were the puffing tugs
that were to see the liner safe alongside her
wharf.

  “We had better go down now and finish
packing,” said May, breaking the silence.

  She darted off, leaving George and
Elaine alone.

   “ Isn’t it glorious, Elaine ? ” said the man.

  “Glorious! Yes, it is very glorious and
wonderful; and I am so happy. I had
almost forgotten the real quest of our jour-
ney,” Elaine said with some feeling.

  “ I want you to tell me something before
we land,” said George, leaning close to her.

  He slipped her hand into his and waited.

  “ I want you to say ‘Yes,’ now—before
we go ashore. Just look up into my eves
and say ‘ Yes.’”

  Another moment passed. She did not
take her hand from his. He was so close
to her that she -seemed to be leaning against
him for support.

  Then, all of a sudden she turned her
wonderful face up to his. Her eyes mir-
rored the glory of life. Her lips parted.
She silentlv muttered so he could just barely
hear: “Yes.”

  A shudder ran through her body. The
man, whose wife by that word she had
promised to be, squeezed her hand with all
the assurance that the situation afforded.

  They hurried to their staterooms, for
there was little time left for the final
packing.

  When they appeared on deck again, they
had all their traveling-bags with them.
England being a free - trade country, the
traveler is not molested by inquisitive cus-
toms’ agents. All that one need do is to
go ashore with his trunks.

  The only obstacle to his landing is the
numberless porters and carriers. These
men are ever ready with open palms for
tips, but they will work with a will once
they receive the price of a drink.

  Elaine and May stood aside and admired
the clever manner and the swiftness with
which George despatched their luggage.

  In a few moments they were aboard a
train bound for London. There they spent
the night. In the morning, when they
looked out of the windows of the little hotel
near the Inns of Court—that historic sec-
tion of old London devotedly loved by its
corps of barristers—a dense fog enveloped
everything.

  One must really experience a London fog
to understand its density. It will settle over
the city for days. During its stay, it is
impossible for one to see three feet ahead
of him.

  Many of the stores are closed. The jew-
elry establishments put up their heavy steel
or iron shutters to prevent robbery. The
cabmen — on whom the burden of traffic
depends—are obliged to lead their horses.
They lead the animal by the bridle with
one hand, and in the other they carry a
torch—the flames of which prevent them
from colliding with other vehicles.

  The fog kept them indoors for three
days. It was declared to be the densest
that London had known in years. On the
morning of the fourth day it raised suffi-
ciently to allow them to proceed to Euston
Station without hindrance. From Euston
Station they took the express to Devon.

CHAPTER XVII.
In the Fog.

T~\URING the three days that Clifford
and the girls were held prisoners by
the fog of old London, they passed the time
telling stories. Both Elaine and May were
particularly fond of tales about dogs, and
they were not slow in letting George under-
stand that a good dog story would please
them more than anything else. So George
agreed, and I know that you will want to
hear the story that he related about Cobs
before we journey on with our friends to
Devon. This is just as he told it:

  “How can we do it?” Mrs. Lawrie
asked.

  “ It’s rough on him—and us,” replied
Jack Lawrie, tracing the pattern of the car-
pet with a restless boot-toe, “ but—it’s—got
to be, I suppose. Just like parting with
one of ourselves, isn’t it? Cobs is—”

   Cobs, himself, prevented the finishing of
the sentence. Hearing his name, he had
leaped out of the hall window-sill, from
which point of vantage he had been watch-
ing his chum, Fifine, the French poodle,
who lived next door, trying to catch spar-
rows on the lawn. Cobs grinned broadly
and chuckled with every muscle of his
body when the sparrows dodged the poodle’s
rushes and chirped contemptuously from the
maple boughs.

Resting his chin on his master’s knee,
Cobs looked up with topaz eyes that were
268

THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.

limpid wells brimming with loyalty. His
stump of a tail with “measured beat and
slow” declared his affection for his master.

  “Good old chap,” said Jack, looking
down into the honest eyes of the dog.

  With a sigh of satisfaction and an ac-
celeration of the tail signals, Cobs removed
his chin and crossed the room to pay his
devoirs to his mistress. Receiving from
her a hearty patting and some loving words,
he waited until his gentlemanly instincts
told him that it was proper to take his
departure for the hall window.

   A silence fell 011 the young couple.

  “After all, Bea,” said Jack, “it’s only
for a time, you knows Chusmann is a
very decent sort. He loves dogs, too. Cobs
is sure to have plenty of grub, which he
mightn’t get for the present if he stuck
to us.”

  “ I know, dear,” quavered the little
woman. “It isn’t that I think that Cobs
won’t be treated kindly or be well taken
care of. But—it’s the parting with him.
I’m sure that he’ll be just as miserable
without us as we’ll be without him."

  Jack rose and took the girl in his arms
and stopped the quivering of her lips with
a touch of his own.

  “ Of course, of course,” he said sooth-
ingly, “we’ll all of us feel this—breaking
up of the family, most awfully. But don't
forget, Bea. that it's only for a time. Why,
the very moment we get that snug mite of
a flat not far from Riverside Park, so that
Cobs can chevy sparrows and fish for sticks
to his heart’s content, he'll join us again.”
“ Are you sure that Chusmann will give
him up when we want him? ”

  “Well, he’s consented to sign an agree-
ment to the effect that as soon as we’ve paid
him what we owe him, plus the amount of
Cobs’s board-bill, Cobs himself is to be re-
turned to us in good condition.”

  Bea nodded a rather dreary approval of
the arrangement.

  “ Cobs is worth in the open market to-
day—” began Jack.

  “Market?” said Mrs. Lawrie, her big
eyes wide with vague fear.

  “ You blessed innocent,” laughed her
husband, “ I believe that you think of a
market in connection with saws and cleav-
ers and gory butchers' blocks. No, I don't
intend that Cobs shall grace a pot-roast,
which, I believe, is Aleutian Islandese for
dog-served-in-every-style. ’ ’

   “ Don’t, Jack.”

  “All right, dear. But as I was about
to say, I could sell Cobs to any fancier for
at least a couple of hundred dollars. Chus-
mann admits this. We owe him nearly fifty
dollars. So you see he’s 'got lots of se-
curity for his debt. And, Bea, the bully
old fellow whispered to me, just as I was
leaving: ‘ My frent, Meester Laweree, ef
you vant any meats more, alretty, take 'em'.
Ve’ll sharge 'em up der dog against. You
hoongry don't go, s'long dis store opens is,
yes? My regarts the leetle frau to and
compliments mit this, the bag in!”

  “ So that's where the chicken came
from?” said Bea, with a rippling laugh.

   “ Yes. ”

  “ Why didn't you tell me before? I was
horribly afraid that our troubles had driven
you to desperation—and our neighbor’s
roosts.”

   “ I'd raid them soon enough, if I thought
you needed a fricassee.”

  “Silly!” replied the wife, -snuggling
close to him. “Are you never going to
get over that kind of nonsense?”

  “Never,” said Jack stoutly—and hus-
band and wife straightway forgot their
troubles in remembering the things that
love had wrought for them.

  For three generations the firm had been
Lawrie & Son, importers of fiber. The con-
cern was the biggest in the business, and
the canniness of McKenzie Lawrie, the
founder, seemed to pass, with other assets,
from heir to heir. It was an unwritten
but stanchly honored law that the eldest
son of the head of the firm should, at birth,
be made a full-fledged partner, his share of
the profits being duly placed to his credit
in the care of a regularly appointed
guardian.

  When this son was of an age to begin his
life-work, he took up his burdens of the
business as a matter of preordination.
And this routine had stood for four gen-
erations, Jack being the last link in the
chain of the Lawrie traditions.

   Long before his son had left college, Mr.
Lawrie, with the fatuity of a stubborn
father, had planned a matrimonial alliance
for Jack, which would mean the ending of
an ancient business feud between Lawrie &
Son, and its only rival of note, Closely,
Bardon & Hollister. As a matter of fact,
there wasn’t a Bardon or a Hollister any
more, but there was a Closely, and he was
legions in himself. Closely had an only
daughter. Bethida was a trifle passe, per-

haps, but she looked pretty well at dinner
. if the candle shades were of the right color
and sufficiently opaque. She was square-
shouldered, rode to hounds, and was a
member of several women’s clubs. But
Closely was rich. He limped with a su-
perb gout and possessed a nose of the hue
and dimensions of a beet-root. He wasn’t
averse to an honorable peace with Lawrie,
if it didn’t mean an appearance of defeat
and a lessening of revenue.

  Lawrie had sounded Closely about the
welding of business interests, by means of
a union of Jack and Bethida, and Closely
jumped—metaphorically, of course—at the
idea. Then followed discussions and con-
ventions, and at length it was agreed that
the interests of the two firms should be
pooled on the day of Jack’s engagement to
Bethida, to the utter confusion and over-
throw of all rival fiber concerns, great or
small.

  Jack, on the completion of his college
course, was promptly shipped to Europe,
and told to remain there for at least two
years.

  “ I am going to make you travel, my
boy,” said Mr. Lawrie, “so that you may
find out how deuced little you know. Of
course, you will make an ass of yourself,
but don’t be more kinds of an ass than you
can help. You’ll get a liberal monthly
allowance, but not a penny more. If you
■fall into traps, especially those that are
baited with petticoats, you will have to
wriggle out of them as best you can.
Don’t look to me for any assistance.”

  Jack departed, followed his father’s in-
structions to the best of his ability, and
returned to the land of his birth freighted
with a fair knowledge of the world in gen-
eral and Paris in particular.

  He plunged into business, and at once
gave evidence that he was fitted to play the
secondary role in the cast of Lawrie & Son.
After a time, Mr. Lawrie senior bethought
himself that affairs were ripe for the intro-
duction of Miss Closely. Jack met the girl,
and was a trifle disgusted, but yet more
amused, at her mannish fads. Miss Close-
ly, having in mind her approaching thirties,
made up to Jack as best she knew how. But
the young fellow, in his wildest flights
of fancy, never dreamed that Miss Closely,
who had been taken into her father’s con-
fidence, looked upon him as a prospective
husband.

  Of course, he never suspected that his

father had taken the liberty of mapping out
his matrimonial career.

   So a year passed. The husband of Jack’s
only sister died suddenly, and the widow
and her two children became members of
the Lawrie mansion on Madison Avenue.
The girls were respectively six and eight
years ol age. Elinor, the eldest, was very
delicate. It was decided to entrust the pre-
liminary education of the girls to a nursery
governess, and Beatrice Tolliver obtained
the position. It may be that way down in
the tough old heart of Mr. Lawrie there
was a touch of compunction for Beatrice,
whose father had died after the going up
of his firm, which was put out of business
by Lawrie & Son’s cornering operation.

   Miss Tolliver was a wildfiower kind of a
girl, with eyes of vivid violet and a per-
sonality that exuded the delicate sweetness
of an evening primrose. Jack promptly
fell in love with her, and after months of
quiet and persistent wooing, she at length
acknowledged that she had just as promptly
fallen in love with him.

  Of the storm in the Lawrie household
when Jack told his father of his feelings
for the girl, of the threats, promises, and
entreaties with which Mr. Lawrie sought
to shake his son’s determination to make
Beatrice his wife, of the final expulsion of
Jack from the firm, plus his two thousand
five hundred dollars, and minus his bril-
liant prospects, and of the amazement that
filled the fiber world when, on the day of
Jack’s marriage, the sign over the offices on
Water Street was altered from Lawrie &
Son to Lawrie & Company, this history
need not deal in detail.

  After a rather prolonged honeymoon.
Jack obtained a position as buyer with a
rival of his father, rented a little house in
New Lyons, a residential city on the Sound,
furnished it prettily, and began to taste
the delights of the spring-time of matri-
mony. It was about this time that Cobs
came to lie one of the family.

   Meantime the unexpected was brewing in
the caldron of fate. Lawrie and Closely
had more meetings.

  “ Why should we let that condemned
young fool of yours stand in the way of
consolidation as we intended ? ” growled
Closely.

  “Why, indeed,” acquiesced the other.
Then came the fiber combine, which bred
many failures, killed other combinations,
and caused trouble in general.
270

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

   Jack’s turn to feel a touch of one of the
tentacles of the octopus came in due course.

  “ Boss wants to see you in his private
office, Mr. Lawrie,’’ said the office-boy one
day.

  “Jack,” began the “old man” hesita-
tingly, “ I've got rather unpleasant news for
you.”

  “Yes?” replied Jack, wondering if his
father was ill.

  “The fact is—oh! hang it, boy, I’ll be
frank with you. Old Closely has insisted
on your discharge, and—we can’t afford to
disregard his wishes. We’ve been threat-
ened with reprisals if we don’t get rid of
you. Closely knows that you know so
much about the inside business of the com-
bine that he’s afraid -we will take advan-
tage of it. And I think you’ll find that he
lias blacklisted you throughout the trade!”

  Jack’s mouth and eyes looked dangerous.

   “ If it weren’t for. dad,” he muttered, “ I
certainly would put an incidental spoke in
Closely’s wheel. But—I can't as things
are.”

  “You know what I think of you, per-
sonally, Jack,” his boss went on. “Yet
how can I afford to buck the combine?
Count on me as a friend and draw on the
cashier for a month ahead.”

  Jack broke the ‘idings very gently to
Bea that night, Cobs listening meanwhile in
his favorite pose—his chin on his master’s
knee, and Bea, to the intense surprise of
her husband, instead of crying, “ Oh, dear,
what will become of us?” or bursting into
tears, came to him with flushed cheeks and
shining eyes, and, putting her arms around
his neck, said:

  “What do we care, dear! My clever,
brave old boy, you can do just whatever
you set your mind on. I’m only too glad
that you're out of that stuffy office. So
there! ”

  The prediction that he was blacklisted
in the trade proved to be true. All his old
friends were cordial—but nothing more.
Some were frank, others tried to spare his
feelings, but all were as a unit in refusing
him employment. Then he turned to other
trades only to find that he was rated as
a sort of unskilled laborer, and would be
compensated as such.

  Next he tried to make use of the techni-
cal knowledge he had acquired at college,
and discovered that he would have to begin
at the foot of the ladder, which he couldn't
afford to do. He sought a position as

“coach,” but found the field overcrowded.
He experimented with subscription books
and life insurance. Each of these efforts—
which in all covered nearly a twelvemonth
—brought returns, but of a microscopic
sort.

  All through those trying days the little
wife was a bloom of cheerfulness and com-
fort. Finally the day arrived when, cast-
ing up accounts, he found that he had a
bank balance of seventy-three dollars, owed
the New Lyons tradespeople about eighty
dollars. Another month’s rent would soon
be due, and he had no employment.

  Jack’s sister, acting under her physician’s
advice, had journeyed to the south of France
for an indefinite period. So the elder Law-
rie was alone in the big house on Madison
Avenue. Closely, disregarding his doctor^
orders, had celebrated the successful con-
summation of a big deal with a dinner where
the wines outnumbered the courses. The
next morning he was found by his valet a
purple carcass, the scarlet of his nose defy-
ing the pallid touch of death.

  Loneliness and trouble wrought a miracu-
lous change in the nature of Lawrie senior,
and one day he walked into the office of
Jack’s ex-employer.

  “ Ever hear anything of that precious
young rascal of mine?”

  “Np,” said the other, “can’t say I do.
Stay, though, Silsbee, I remember, saw him
at the Grand Central depot about a month
ago. Said he looked a trifle peaked. Said
he was living at New Lyons.”

  “ Umph! ” grunted Lawrie senior, and
walked out of the office. The other man
raised his eyebrows, took some meditative
whiffs of his cigar, and muttering,
“Shouldn’t wonder,” began to paw and
finger and pull apart a lot of stuff that
looked like a tangle of dirty hair.

  Lawrie senior was speeding toward New
Lyons.

  “Looking peaked, is he? Serves him
right, confound him. I'll just take a look
at the quarters the young fools have. Tum-
bledown cottage, or a cheap flat, I'll war-
rant. Hope he’s realizing what a fool he’s
been. Wonder if they have a baby. Of
course they have. People who can't keep
themselves always try to have a family
so as to add to their troubles. If it’s a
boy, wonder if it looks like Jack.”

  The train drew into the station. A
guarded inquiry at the post-office of the
little town put Mr. Lawrie in possession of
THROUGH BY SUNRISE.

271

Jack’s address. But he didn’t go there
direct.

  “They’ll be loafing about their piazza,
if they have one, and if they happen to see
me they’ll think I’m here to hoist the white
flag,” he meditated, and with the assistance
of a voluble small boy, made his way to
the sea front, determined to wait until dusk
before inspecting the home of his son.

  On the beach was a small board-walk
lined with benches. On one of these Mr.
Lawrie sat down, noticing mechanically that
the only other occupant was a fat, rosy in-
dividual who was smoking a cigar with the
aid of a huge meerschaum holder of unmis-
takable Teutonic manufacture. A band
played softly from a point on the rocks,
the sands were dotted with couples and
family groups, and the unruffled surface of
the Sound was flecked by specks of snowy
canvas.

  Mr. Lawrie had been sitting there for
fifteen minutes or so, thinking many things
and feeling the emphasis of his loneliness
by reason of the companionship of those
around him, when he was startled by some-
thing cold and clammy being insinuated
into the palm of his hand.

  Looking down he saw Cobs—Cobs, with
a kindly light in his eye, and a cordial,
if not effusive, wag of his stump of a tail.
Seeing that he was recognized, Cobs once
more put his nose trustingly into the hand
of the fiber magnate, sniffed meditatively,
and again beamed a welcome of a very
sincere sort.

  The fat, rosy one on the bench burst into
unctuous laughter.

  “Veil, veil,” said he, “Cobs wants frents
to make yet. Cobs not often hands shakes
like dat oonless he would be chumps, yes.”
“ Does he belong to you ? ”

  “Ach, no. I myself wish dat he vas
mine. He lives his peeples vitli—Meester
Lawrie and Meesus Lawrie. Fine peoples,
yes. See dem dere on the sand—der leetle
frau mit the blue dress. Ach, der nicest
peeples as vas. But—”

  “But what?”

  “ Veil, I t’inks me dey vas pretty hard up.
Dey owes me money, but I don’t mind, no.
Dey goes to live in New York soon alrettv.
Cobs he stay mit me ven dey goes.”

  “Why do you take charge of Cobs?”

  “ Oh, chust arrangements, frents be-
tween. Dat’s all. Cobs, he like New
Lyons better as New York, yes.” And
Chusmann wheezed laboriously.

  But Mr. Lawrie, accustomed to draw in-
ferences from hints, guessed the situation
on the instant, and he felt almost angry
with himself because he experienced no
satisfaction in learning that Jack was suf-
fering for his alleged disobedience.. So he
looked long and longingly at the young
couple on the sands. He saw how the girl
unconsciously leaned against her husband
and how the latter as unconsciously sup-
ported her, and, seeing, felt something
within him soften, melt, and vanish.

  Then, with a parting pat for Cobs, who
had been snuggling confidingly against his
leg all this time, and a friendly nod to
Chusmann, Mr. Lawrie, with the loneliness
tugging more strangely than ever at his
heart-strings, made his way back to the
village.

  The Lawrie cottage stood in one of the
parks of New Lyons wherein each house
is separated by a lawn and there are shade-
trees in abundance.

  The roads in the park are of the ser-
pentine sort, so that a landscape effect is
obtained within the compass of a small
area.

  Opposite the cottage is a wooded slope, on
the crest of which stands the house of the
rich man of the town. From a picturesque,
standpoint, the scheme of New Lyons i.‘
admirable, but its police force is of an un-
certain quantity, and the town council is
economical in the matter of street-lights.
The town is one of the halting stations of
the migratory tramp.

  The Lawrie family had just finished their
meager supper. The dishes all being
washed and things generally tidied up, they
were comfortably seated in their little den,
when Cobs came to his feet with a bound.
Giving tongue to his battle-cry, lie made
a rush for the street door, at which he
scratched frantically.

  “ Something up for sure,” remarked
Jack, as he opened the door. The dog.
with a fierce growl, bounded over the
piazza railing to the lawn below, and made
for a. writhing heap in the roadway. Jack
followed, but before he could overtake the
dog, the heap resolved itself into two men,
one of whom rose, only to fall prone again,
while the other was striking desperately at
Cobs, who was clinging like a leech to his
wrist.

  Cobs was too skilled a warrior to allow
himself to be finally vanquished on ac-
count of a preliminary advantage, and so
272

lie suddenly loosed his hold. At once the
man turned and ran. This was what Cobs
wanted. Before the biped had gone a
couple of yards, the quadruped, with a long
antelopelike leap, had fastened his fangs
in the back of the man's neck. Shrieking
with pain and terror, he fell backwards,
the hot breath and low growls of his cap-
tor playing on his face.

  “ Hold him, Cobs! ” shouted Jack. “ I'll
be there in a moment!” Cobs replied gut-
turally that he would, sinking his teeth a
trifle deeper as he did so.

  Bea, peering anxiously from thfe ver-
anda, heard her husband call:

  “ Bring a lamp! ”

  Bea obeyed. The young people saw with
amazement, consternation, anJ pity that the
man who had risen and fallen again was
Jack’s father—insensible, dust-covered, and
blood-stained.

  “ I'll get him into the house at once,”
said Jack. “You telephone for Dr. Jar-
kins and get the spare bed ready.”

  “What about the other man?” asked
Bea.

  “ Dr. Cobs is attending to him, all right.
But I'll see to him presently.” Taking his
father in his arms, Jack carried him very
tenderly into the house which he had never
expected to see him enter.

  It was two days later, and Mr. Lawrie,
weak and shakv, but rapidly recovering
from the assault upon him, was lying in
lied telling Jack and Bea of his adventure.
Incidentally he held the hands of his son
and daughter-in-law, and his eyes sought
their faces hungrily.

  “Dear old dad,” said Jack, “so you
reallv wanted to see where we were camped
out?”

  Mr. Lawrie nodded. “Yes,” he said,
“and—and—Jack, you didn’t have the
shades down in the room in which you were
sitting.”

 “No?”

  “No, and so, after I'd seen you and
Bea, as I then did, if that scoundrel hadn’t
given me a tap on the head at that moment,
I—think—I—should have asked you for a
night’s lodging.”

  Jack squeezed his father’s hand con-
vulsively.

  “ Where is our footpad, by the way,”
asked Mrs. Lawrie.

  “ In the hospital—as a prisoner. Cobs
mauled him badly. The man turns out to
lie a hold-up who’s very much wanted by

the police. Cobs had a narrow squeak for
his life, too, for the man was trying to
get at him with a knife. He couldn’t, as
Cobs had sense enough to grab him by
the nape of the neck.”

  “God bless Cobs!” said Mr. Lawrie
fervently. “ If it hadn't been for him I
mightn’t have been here with you. Bea,
my girl, I don't blame Jack a bit. I was
a stubborn, old—”

  Bea deliberately placed a rosy palm over
his mouth. “ You're talking far too much,
Now, try and have a good long nap while
Jack and I get up a nice little dinner for
you.”

  Mr. Lawrie smiled drowsily and con-
tentedly. “ All right,” he said, with a
yawn, “and, Jack, I'll have that sign—
made—over into Lawrie—and Son. Bea,
would you like me to buy you—this cottage
for—a—wedding present ? Good dog, good
dog, good Cobs, good—”

CHAPTER XVIII.
Reunited for Life.

T TNCLE Tom and Billee and the house-
hold marveled at the three strangers
who appeared at the lodge gates one after-
noon.

  A more glorious sunshine had never been
seen on the coast, as Devon was popularly
known. It seemed as if a day of peculiar
brightness had been specially created for
the arrival of Elaine and her friends.

  Sunshine does so much to bring gladness
into our lives, and when Uncle Tom clasped
Elaine to his breast and Billee—now a
grown girl just budding into the delight of
her early years of understanding—greeted
her with all the affection of a daughter
welcoming her mother, George Clifford and
May Pierce stood aside and let the willing—^
tears come to their eyes.

  “ Billee,” said Elaine, motioning to Clif-
ford, “ I have brought home your father.”
The man and the little girl looked at
each other quizzically for a second. It
only took the second for the man to see—
to know. The child was less sure. She
had lived so long an orphan that it was
difficult for her to understand that the
tall, handsome gentleman, beaming on her
with a kindly face, was really one of the
lost parents that she had loved as myths.

George Clifford approached the little
girl. Getting down on one knee, he held

273

out his arms to her. The instinct of the
child for its parent—the wonderful instinct
inculcated by Heaven never to die—told
little Billee that her life would no longer
be devoid of the dearest attraction that a
child can know.

  She rushed into her father's arms, and
the kisses that he showered on her face and
neck, the tears that dimmed his eyes and
the words of endearment that he uttered,
assured her that he was really her father,
and that his heart was filled with love and
devotion.

  And Clifford knew that the little girl
was his own. One by one her features
slowly unfolded before his eyes; little by
little Uncle Tom told his story of the
coming of Billee into his possession.

  And on that day father and daughter
were united in life.

  The following morning, George Clifford
took his little daughter for a walk through
the vast flower -gardens of her foster-
parents' home.

  When they were finally seated under a
"reat oak, planning all manner of wonder-
ful plans for the future, he said to her:

  “ Billee, dear, I have found a new mother
for you. I want you to be very kind and
sweet to her, for she loves you dearly—and
she is one of the loveliest beings that
Heaven ever created.”

(The

   “ Daddy, I am so happy. Do tell me—
who? ”

   “ Elaine,” he said. “ Elaine, who brought
 me to you—who found you for me! Elaine
 who brought the song of the nightingale to
 America and told me (hat my little girl was
 still alive!”

   “ I'm so happy, dear daddy,” said Billee,
 throwing her arms around his neck. “Isn’t
 she just the sweetest, dearest Elaine?”

   A few days later the marriage was sol-
 emnized in the little chapel on Uncle Tom’s
 estate. Billee Clifford was the bridesmaid
 and Uncle Tom was the best man, and May
 Pierce was a maid of honor with a great
 bunch of roses.

   She thanked Heaven that such happiness
 could come to man and woman and a little
 child.

   For some weeks they lingered at beauti-
 ful Devon before returning to New York.
 And every evening Mr. and Mrs. Clifford
 and Billee sat in the groves surrounding
 that old English home, and listened to the
 song of the nightingales.

   “Isn't it wonderful, my darling?” said
 George.

   “ Wonderful, oh, so wonderful—so won-
derful,” answered Elaine.

   “ And the night before you came,” said
 little Billee, “ it seemed as if they didn't
 get through singing until sunrise.”

 OLD ENGINEER HONORED.

The Erie Railroad’s Reward to Harvey Springstead for the Careful and
Intelligent Management of His Engine.

Ql'ITE a sensation was sprung on the Erie
employees and patrons when engine 970
recently appeared, looking as if it had just come
out of the bandbox; the number had been trans-
ferred - from under the cab-windows to the
sand-box, and the name of its engineer, Harvey
Springstead. appeared in big gilt letters on the
cab.

  Xo one had seen an engine 011 the New York
Division bearing a man’s name since the en-
gineers built the “ Daniel Willard " for the Chi-
cago Exposition, in 1900, and this graceful " G-
15" engine naturally aroused interest and curi-
osity as to what it all meant.

  The distinction was awarded for the excellent
performance, the lack of failures, and the general
good condition of the engine while under the

    6	RR

careful and intelligent management of Mr.
Springstead.

  The engine was last shopped in October, 1910,
having made over 45,000 miles since last previous
general repairs.

  Engineer Springstead started firing in 1S73,
011 the Goshen way-train, arid when “ Ed ”
Haggerty, who was his engineer, retired, in 1886,
Harvey, who had just been [Promoted to engineer,
took his place, and has been continuously in the
passenger-train service since, with a remarkably
good record.

  He started railroading when a mere boy and,
notwithstanding his long term of service, is still
far from the retiring limit, being only 53 years
of age. and looks forward to many more years
on the running-boaid.
LARRY LEFT ALONE

BY MACDUFFIE MARTIN.

   Another Odd Happening Helps To Sustain the
   Ancient Adage, “ It Isn’t All Gold that Glitters.”

ARRY was the first man of his race
and color to wander into
the forest primeval beyond
the Svvamac River. That
noble body of water was
the only route that the
Indians had followed into the cold country
north of “ fifty-three,” made famous by the
oft-repeated statement that never a law of
God or man existed there.

  Larry had been a switchman on a little
branch of the N. X. ever since he was old
enough to go out into the world and sup-
port a widowed mother. His father had
worked on the line before him, but when
he lost his life in a wreck and left abso-
lutely nothing with which to educate his
son or keep his widow in bread and meat,
Larry was obliged to look into the future
without blinking.

  It is only natural, therefore, that he
should take up the calling in which his
father had spent the best years of his life.
The division superintendent was willing to
give a helping hand. He told Larry that
he would have to begin at the beginning,
and Larry did begin at the very beginning.
On the day that we begin this chronicle of
his career, he had worked up to the position
of a switchman. ' And he was a good one.

  He was so good on the job that when he
announced his intention of quitting and
following the ill-conditioned rumors of the
Indians that were wafted down from the
North, more than one man tried to turn
him against them.

  These rumors told of wonderful deposits
of gold that existed in that faraway spot
“north of fifty-three.” They were similar
to the rumors that made men leave their
homes and seek fortunes in the Klondike.

     Larry had a mind that turned to riches
  quickly gained. Unlike his fatiier, he did
  not believe in a steady position with a
  certain increase of pay every year and a
  comfortable, humble home. He didn't want
  to be one of the great army of men who
  work for a wage.

     He had visions of owning a railroad of
  his own some day, and when the rumors of
  gold in the wilderness reached his ears, and
  he had digested them thoroughly, he said
  unto himself that he would go thither, come
  back rich—and, then, who could stop him?

     He told his ?ood mother when he start-
  ed that he wouTd come home rich within
  a year. Lest she should want for the neces-
  sary commonplaces of life during his ab-
  sence. he turned over to her all his savings
  —and they amounted to a sum that was not
  to be sneezed at. Larry was blessed with
  thrift. All men who know the value of a
  dollar are blessed with it. He took with
  him only sufficient to travel so far as the
  railroad ran—and he haggled with agents
  for second-class tickets and tourist rates
  until they were willing to grant his wishes
  out of sheer despair.

     Leaving the final terminus, of the rail-
  road. he embarked in a small steamboat up
  the Svvamac. Aboard the boat the rumors
  were thicker than the gadflies that infested
  the region in summer.

     Larry was told by the red-bearded indi-
  vidual who guided the destiny of the craft
  that the man who first penetrated the deso-
  late region would not only find gold on the
  bushes, but he would stumble over it at
  every step. The only drawback would be
  the finder’s lack of strength to bring back
  to civilization all that he could carry.

    How did the captain know? The In-
274
LARRY LEFT ALONE.

275

dians had told him. He had talked with
them time and again on the little wharf at
Fifty Hole, the most northerly point on
the Swamac where the boat stopped. And,
finally, when it did arrive there and started
down 'stream on its homeward journey,
Larry watched it with a plaintive watching
until it disappeared around a bend between
the high palisades that guarded its banks.
Then he turned to the Indians.

   The gold-fields were miles and miles far-
ther north. He would find them by fol-
lowing the Swamac some ten miles, and
then, by making an overland journey of
some five or six miles, he would save some
distance caused by a bend in the river.

  When he reached the river again, he
would find a portage. The river could be
crossed at that point in a canoe which he
would find high on the bank. Once across,
he should follow the trail—it would not be
hard to find—follow it for another five
miles or more. Then Opliir and Monte-
zuma and King Solomon's mines were his!

  Larry reached his destination. It was a
wild, desolate spot. The river was near
by; for that he was thankful. As far as
the eye could see, there were great moun-
tains that rolled upward to fields of eternal*
snow. Around him was a massive prairie,
marked hither and yon with clumps of
trees and stretches of grass, and the most
imposing effect in this wilderness was a
small, rock}- mountain—perhaps it would
be more modest to call it a hill—that jutted
out of the earth more like a peculiar monu-
ment than anything else.

  Undoubtedly, this was the storehouse of
the gold. Beyond all doubt, this was the
receptacle of -his fortune. Within it? rock-
ribbed sides rested the real thing.

  Truly, Mohammed had come to the
mountain!

  He would delve into it without further
ado, fill a scuttle or two of the precious
metal, and make his way back to Fifty
Hole. Then he would return for another
scuttle or two—and so on until he had
accumulated sufficient to fill the steamboat
when it reached Fifty Hole.

  Then he would hike back to his mother
and his native town and buy the N. X.,
and any other road that might happen to lie
on the market.

  When he ceased building his castles in
the air, it dawned upon him that he was
feeling somewhat lonesome. Of course,
there was no human habitation in sight.

  Larry was the first of his race and blood
to inhabit the place. He had brought bacon
and crackers and tea. He had also brought
matches carefully rolled in a piece of rub-
ber cloth, and a pipe and some tobacco;
but as lie gazed over the wild circumjacence,
lie realized that he had not a place to lay
his head.

  Perhaps it would be best to return to
Fifty Hole and camp there, and make the
journey to and from the mountain of gold
every day. Brilliant thought! He would
then be a commuter in the wilderness. But
as he looked at the sun just beginning to
tip the mountains in the west, he knew that
he could not make Fifty Hole again that
night.

  Near the base of the mountain of gold
he found a little space that nature had
caused between two large boulders. The
rock rose sharp and perpendicular on either
side, the floor .was covered with a fine
gravel, and the entire opening gave him
some six square feet in which to seek some
shelter.

  It lacked a roof, but that troubled him
only a little. The night was clear and
there was no sign of rain or wind. Be-
sides, it was only for one night—and surely
a man could rough it for one night when
fortune was all around him.

  He stood between the two boulders—the
entrance to his primeval home—and looked
around. What a wonderful stillness! What
a marvelous quiet! Adjusting his pack so
that it rested against the boulder, he stepped
outside.

  The twilight was just beginning to dim
the landscape. He stepped a few feet far-
ther and stopped short; just why, he could
not tell. A cold wind suddenly swept over
the prairie—the cold, peculiar wind that
seems to be born of nightfall, and is known
only in such places.

  It made him button his coat about his
throat. He listened again. He thought he
heard a sound.

  It was not an unfamiliar sound. He
cocked his head to one side to be sure, and
then started in its direction. It came from
a projection of the hill about a hundred
feet away. He walked thither to explore.

  The sound was water — water gushing
from a spring and rilling along the ground,
possibly to the Swamac. He knelt down
and drank of it. He hastened back to his
cache and returned with his tin kettle and
filled it.
276

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

  “ Good ! ” he said aloud. “ I will not
have to make a trip to the river every time
I want water.”

  That excitement over, he stood again in
the entrance of his primeval home. From
the river banks now came the croak of
strange throats, and, overhead, some strange
bird circled and uttered shrill cries. He
looked up at it and wondered why it
frightened him.

  Then he thought it was about time for
food. Gathering some dry branches, he
soon had a fire. Over the fire he placed
his frying-pan. As it warmed, he sliced a
dozen strips from the side of bacon. As
he threw the slices into the pan, they sizzled
and browned and smelled—like home!

  He placed the frying-pan on the ground.
Picking up the bacon slice by slice in his
fingers he devoured it, with crackers as a
side dish and cool spring water for wine.

  It was a rough meal—the first, indeed,
that he had ever cooked. But what mat-
tered that, when the price of a railroad or
two lay at his feet?

  In a short time it was pitch-dark. The
prairie wind was blowing up colder. Like-
wise, it was blowing with more force. It
is a wonderful wind, that wind of the north-
western plains. When it does blow, it has
all the force of a northern Titan sweeping
the world. There is 110 obstacle in its
path — nothing to block the mighty mo-
mentum that it gains as the night comes on.

  It blew right into the opening of Larry’s
primeval home. So great was its velocity,
nurtured in the northern Canadian prairies,
and increasing in volume as it came on
toward the south, that it took Larry’s side
of bacon and his frying-pan and other ob-
jects of primeval art and swept them up
through the roofless habitat into the great
unknown.

  Such slight and simple commodities as
his crackers and his Oolong tea were as the
leaves of yester year in its path. He drew
himself into the further corner of the abode.
With his legs close together, his muscles
drawn taut, and both hands holding his hat
down over his tightly closed eyes, he won-
dered if he hadn't struck the only and
original cave of the winds.

  “This is a shine dump,’’ said Larry.

  He jammed his hat down tight, for his
arms were getting numb. This change
lasted only the faintest fraction of a second.
The very instant that he dropped his hands
to his side, he felt the wind getting under

his hat, and he slammed his hands on it
with hammerlike velocity.

  Then he removed his hat and placed it
between his knees. That gave his arms a
rest. He didn't mind the breezes doing a
]o-the-poor-Indian stunt with his locks, al-
though he felt the cold pierce his scalp
with none too tender touches.

   Pie thought that he would light his pipe
and try to smoke. His attempt to fill the
bowl in that wind was a farce. In the
crass darkness, he could not tell which was
pipe and which was pouch; and ere he
knew it, the fine-cut was flying up into his
face and eyes.

  Believing that he had the bowl of the
pipe filled, he turned his face to the wall of
his abode and brought his matches from his
pocket. The first one that he struck went
out; so did the second; so did the third; so
did the fourth—and so did the fourteenth.

   At the end of this, score, he decided that
smoking was a luxury that he could not
afford—matches were too scarce. But he
resolved to have one more try. He crouched
down—down in the corner of the abode—
he drew his coat over his head and doubled
himself up into every conceivable posture
that would keep the howling wind from his
pipe.

   Then he took out another match. \\ ith
the caution of a surgeon cutting through a

    O	OO

vein, he struck it on his leg. It flickered
and flamed up. With equal caution he
thrust it into the bowl of his pipe, and
puffed. None of the old, familiar flavor
permeated his palate. He simply drew in
air. The tobacco that he had put in his
pipe—if, indeed, he had really done so—
had been carried away by the wind.

   “ This is a shine dump,” said Larry.

   He replaced his hat and jammed it tight
on his head. Bracing his back against the
back wall of his apartment, he sat down,
drawing his knees close to his chin. He
clasped his hands about his knees, and
huddled himself closer and closer together.
_ He thought that he would be comfortable
in this position. To give him credit, he
looked at it philosophically. It was only a
matter of passing the night. To be sure, he
had been a trifle foolish in leaving Fifty
Hole that day without knowing more about
his destination, but in the morning he
would return to Fifty Hole and arrange for
the proper covering to give him shelter un-
til he had dug sufficient from the mountain
of gold to satisfy his cravings.
LARRY LEFT ALONE.

  Compounds and cross-bars, but it was
cold! Colder, indeed, than he had ever
felt even in that northern territory of the
United States where he had lived since
boyhood.

  He felt his hands getting more numb and
still more numb. He removed them from
about his knees and thrust them into his
pockets. Ah, that felt good! That was—

  Presto! His hat blew off! It was lifted
from his head with such marvelous sud-
denness* that it seemed as if some magic
wand, not the wind, were responsible for its
departure.

  “This is a shine dump,” said Larry.

  He took his handkerchief from his pock-
et and tied it under his chin. That, at
least, would protect his head from the ter-
rible cold. Then he huddled up closer and
closed his eyes. Perhaps he might fall
asleep. Perhaps the guarding Providence
would temper the wind to his shorn and
unsheltered seclusion, and let him have a
little peace.

  He closed his eyes. He closed them so
tightly that he clenched his teeth instinc-
tively—and there he sat, and still sat, won-
dering just how many hours still remained
until the dawn. In truth, he had been
there but an hour since darkness. It seemed
like an eternity.

  Finally there came a lull in the wind.
Larry knew this because the seemingly in-
cessant and unmodulating noise that it
made as it coursed through the trees and
over the wastes had somewhat abated.

  Inside his primeval abode there was more
quiet. Outside, the wind seemed to be ta-
king a more spasmodic velocity. Every lit-
tle while it would cause a terrific rustling
among the trees, and then it would die away
as if intent on spending itself with brag
and bluster.

  “That was some blow,” said Larry.

  He stretched himself out on the hard
floor. With one arm for a pillow, he was
ready for rest. His bones ached, and his
brain buzzed with the night noises that
would not cease, but he began to doze.

   Sleep is not recreation; it is re-creation.
If ever a man needed to be re-created, Larry
did that night. Sleep came to him and
wound him in her tender, satisfying arms.

  Some moments passed.

  Touched by the peculiar instinct that
presages fear, he awoke. He sat straight
up, with every faculty alert. It was still
as dark as Stygian desolation; but.it was

calmer, and there was only the faintest
breeze astir.

  Faint though it was, it brought to his
nostrils the most peculiar odor that ever
greeted his sense of smell. It reminded
him of the animal tent of a circus. He
sniffed—and then he sniffed some more.

  There was a rustling on the gravel out-
side—a rustling -as if some animal were
passing to and iro.

  Larry's heart-beats were as audible as the
regular striking of a clock. His breath
came in short gasps. He could feel his
face quiver with fear.

  Suddenly, as if flashed from a cannon,
two green eyes appeared at the opening of
the abode.

  Larry surmised that they were eyes, for
they moved now and then; and, also, the
thing or beast or demon was panting as a
dog will pant when out of breath.

  At first he thought that it was a dog;
but when it suddenly filled the night with
the most raucous combination of half bark
and half yelp, Larry concluded that it
wasn't. Evidently tired of this mode of
noise-making, it barked with slow, gut-
tural, soul-piercing profundity, and wound
up with a wail so dismal that it smote Lar-
ry to the core.

  A coyote had scented him out—but it
might have been a polar bear or a moun-
tain-lion or a Baltimore oriole, so far as
he knew.

  Brushing his hand over the ground, he
encountered a stone. He raised his arm,
and let it fly directly at the glowing eyes.
Whatever accomplishments Larry may have
lacked, he was a game lad.

  He realized that his adversary had him
cornered, and he was ready to show fight.-
The stone was*evidently well aimed. He
heard it strike something with a thud and
fall to the ground.

  The coyote emitted one dismal cry and
fled. It went on its way bellowing and
yelping and howling with intermittent
pauses; and from the rapidly diminishing
volume of its cry, Larry realized that it
had lost no time in getting beyond his
reach.

  “ This is a shine dump,” said Larry.

  He arose and stepped outside the abode.
The peculiar silence of the dead of night
now brooded over all. The wind storm had
abated; the trickle of the water was ap-
parent once more; the plaintive boom of a
night bird was heard across the distance,
27S

and, overhead, the golden stars glistened in
a spray of splendor.

  Larry walked to and fro, for the chill
was still in the air. So bright was the
light of the stars that the entrance to his
abode was plainly visible, and, indeed, it
was easy to read the time of night on his
watch. It was only a little after eleven
o’clock.

  Oh, the long, lonesome night that
stretched before him! How in the name of
Heaven was he going to live through it?
Would the light of day ever come again?

  He sat on the ground. He tied the hand-
kerchief tighter around his throat. He got
on his feet, and made his way to the rill
of water. He stooped and drank. When
he started to rise again his foot slippecf,
and he would have got a good wetting if
he had not broken his fall by catching a
twig. As it was, one leg was wet nearly
to the knee. It made him feel uncomfort-
able.	___

  He entered his abode again determined
to sleep. Despite the saturated trouser-leg
and the bitter cold and the disgruntled
thoughts that were whirling through his
brain, he again took a recumbent position
on the ground and closed his eyes.

  In a little while he was fast asleep.

  Two or three times he awoke and stretched
his numbed body. Then he fell into a
deeper sleep, from which he did not awake
until the sun was fairly high in the heav-
ens, penetrating his body with its warm and
comforting rays.

  This felt so very good that he decided to
lie there a little longer, and get warmed
through and through. The leg that had
received the wetting was a trifle stiff, so he
thought he would rub it a little.

  As he reached down, his hand encoun-
tered close to his body as queer an object
as ever blocked his -sense of touch. It was
a warm, leathery, moist, pulsating sort of a
thing.

  Larry squeezed it—he squeezed it rather
hard. It emitted a hissing sound, and Lar-
ry felt it spring from his grasp something
after the manner of a hawser running
through a pulley.

  The acrobatic avidity displayed by Larry
as he got on his feet could never be told in
words. He had just time to see a huge
rattlesnake make an “ S ’’-like exit through
the entrance of his abode and lose itself in
a crevice in the rocks.

  Larry was thoroughly frightened. He

wondered if he were bitten. It is an old
trick of rattlers at night—and he dyl-not
know it—to coil up close to a’man sleeping
on the plains. The warmth of the- human
body is most pleasing to this poisonous spe-
cies of reptile. It has never been known
to harm a man whose body has afforded a
night's shelter. But Larry did not know
that.

  He drew his lips tightly together, and
felt real fear filling his throat. When he
could utter a sound again, he simply said:

  “This is a shine dump.”

  One resolution was quickly established
in his mind. Gold or no gold—Monte-
zuma or no mazuma—that was no place for
a white man to sleep. Money was all very
well in its way, but if it could only be
mined in the wilderness; at the risk of a
reptile’s fangs, then a job on the section-
gang, at a dollar per, were paradise enow!

. At any rate, he would go back to Fifty
Hole and—get breakfast. There was no
great hurry in commencing the actual work
of prospecting, and a day or so spent in
Fifty Hole would give him a chance to re-
cuperate his peace of mind and get another
hat.

  He began to retrace his footsteps, and
ere nightfall he was again within the shel-
tering confines of the outpost.

  That night, after a good dinner-and a
drop or two of frontier rum, he wandered
into a place that bore the name “Angels’
Rest.”

  Three or four frontier outcast?—trappers
who were awaiting the opening of their sea-
son—induced him to “ sit in ” a poker
game.

  It lasted until well into the night. When
Larry arose from the table he,was minus
his spare cash, his watch, his coat and vest,
and his prospector’s outfit.

  The keeper of the place let him sleep on
the dilapidated billiard-table because he
hadn’t the price of a bed. When he awoke
in the morning and sauntered down the
only thoroughfare he was good and “ sore,”
and he had a taste in his mouth that was
of the “dark brown” variety mixed with a
little lemon.

  Soon he found himself at the river's
bank. There the gladdest sight that had
met his eyes since he left home was before
him. Tied to her primitive dock was the
boat that had conveyed him up the Swa-
mac. Her red-bearded captain was lean-
ing against one of the bitts. Larry could
LARRY LEFT ALONE.

279

have punched his smiling, know-it-all coun-
tenance—but he needed a friend.

  “Back so soon?” asked the captain.
“When do you start for—for home?”
was Larry’s answer.

  “Two o’clock. Going along?”

  “ If I have to hang on to the rudder.”
The skipper smiled grimly. “ Cleaned
you out in a night, eh ? ”

  “ I haven’t got a cent—if that's what you
want to know,” said Larry.

  “ I'll take you as far as I go,” said the
skipper. “I'd hate to see a man stranded
in these diggin’s. Take a hand at leadin’
that freight there. That will help pay for
your transportation.”

  Some few nights after, Larry’s good
mother was startled by a familiar knock
at her cottage door. It came just as she
was in the midst of telling a few old friends

of Larry's departure, and of the possibility
of his great riches.

  She looked at her guests with startled
countenance and rushed to the door. She
swung it open and shrieked in dismay.
Was it Larry or Larry’s ghost? She would
have fallen, but he caught her in his arms.

  “ It’s only me, ma,” he said, as he/kissed
her.

  Larry soon explained why his coat didn’t
fit; why he was wearing a cap two sizes
too large for him; why he was covered with
soot and oil, and looked, generally, as if he
had been used to mop up a roundhouse.

  “What can I do for you, my boy,” said
his mother. “ Oh, what can I do for you—
I’m so glad that you are home!”

  “ Cook me a plate of ham and eggs, ma,”
said Larry, “ and sit down and watch me
eat ’em.”

RAPID RAILROAD-BRIDGE REPAIRING.

WHEN the Lackawanna Railroad wanted a
new draw in its bridge across the Hacken-
sack River, New Jersey, a trifle in steel 195 feet
long and 31 feet wide between centers of trusses,
weighing 600 tons, it was built on the river-bank
parallel to the stream. When finished it was lifted
on jacks, swung around on its pivot at right
angles to the river and moved out on two boats
90 feet long. 29 feet wide, and 8 feet deep.

  Similar boats were run under the old draw, so
that when the tide rose the old was lifted up and
floated off. while the new one was floated into
its place and lowered to position by the fall of
the tide. This operation took ten hours, but it
was done on a Sunday, when traffic was at its
lowest ebb. The drawbridge across the Passaic
was replaced in the same way, April 21, 1901,
in twelve hours.

  On August 11, 1889. Master Carpenter W. K.
Heard, of the Pennsylvania Railroad, with one
hundred men, moved Mill Creek bridge, a struc-
ture 258 feet long, with trusses 10 feet deep and
25 feet apart, weighing 250 tons, 45 feet sidewise
to get it out of the way of the stone arch that was
to replace it in twelve minutes by the watch.

  The Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul planned
to rebuild the wooden truss-bridge across Grand
River, three miles south of Chillicothc, Missouri,
when it got around to it. The structure consisting
of a pile-approach 1,070 feet long, and_four spans
of 138 feet, each resting on piic-piers, was to be
rebuilt piecemeal, the trusses first, in 1895, and
then the piers were to be replaced with masonry.

  IJut the trusses went bad so suddenly that
action had to be taken sooner than was planned.
When false work was put up for erecting the iron,
the river rose anti piled a line of driftwood four

to twelve feet deep and extending up stream 700
feet against the bridge, moving the piers so they
had to be replaced in a hurry.

  After the water had subsided and the drift
had been cleared away, the iron trusses were
erected on the old wooden piers while the new
mas§nry-piers were being put down from twenty-
nine to thirty feet from the old. The four spans
of iron, weighing a total of 714.489 pounds, which
were placed temporarily on the old piers, were
all up November 19, 1S95, while the piers were not
finished until January IS, 1896.

  Girders were put in, reaching from the old
piers to the new, on top of which rollers with
flanges were placed beneath the bottom chords
of '.the new trusses. Then a six-part block and
tackle was fastened to the safety-struts in the
end of the first span, a locomotive was hitched
to the other end of the tackle, and then, with a
conductor and brakeman to pass signals, and
bridgemen to watch the tackle and attend to the
rollers, that heavy span was dragged endwise
thirty feel to its new position as easily as a train-
crew could have spotted a car at an elevator:
Time, six minutes.

  Eight carpenters put in a temporary track as
fast as the gap opened'up, so that traffic might not
be interrupted.

  Then, when a suitable interval between trains
arrived, span number two was dragged in place.
It took nearly seven days of jockeying between
trains to get the job done, but the longest time
consumed in moving any one of the spans was
nineteen minutes.

  Preparations added about an hour ro the mov-
ing time. No passenger-train was delayed, and
the longest delay of a freight was ten minutes.

 A Frontier Man-Hunt

BY R. M . WEST.

THE remarkable schemes that will come into a man's head while he is trying*
to evade his pursuers often puzzle the most scientific minds. These are
not the exact words, but they represent the real sentiment of a famous
French detective, one of the most noted sleuths of his day.

    This story of Jack Malone, a private in the United States army, is based
on truth. It is, perhaps, one of the most remarkable stories of a real man-
hunt ever recorded. For nearly two weeks. Malone evaded his pursuers who
had him hemmed in on all sides. During the hunt, he even talked and walked
with some of them.

Running Down an Army Desperado Whose Nimble Body and Keen Brain
Were More Than a Match for the Scores of Men
Who Were Pursuing Him.

HEN I first saw Fort
Leavenworth, it was not
the fine military head-
quarters it is to-day.
My first glimpse was
in June, 1866, when
the little side-wheeler, New Ella, tied up to
the old rickety wharf to unload about three
hundred raw recruits, of whom I was one.

  We were assigned to the Second Cavalry,
U. S. A., then scattered all along the fron-
tier, trying to check the murderous raids of
the Indians.

  The barracks were little, low-roofed, din-
gy buildings, not at all suited to shelter the
many troops coming in every day. The
fort was poorly laid out. To-day, with its
fine barracks, hospital buildings, officers’
quarters, and the beautiful drives. Fort
Leavenworth is a splendid place to see.

  Across the Missouri River, as I remember,
a dense' woods ran close into the bank.
There was a bridge in course of construc-
tion across the river, its approaches on the
Kansas side being just at the southern end
of the fort. On the Missouri side there was
low marshy land and a place called Slab
City, consisting of three houses and a saw-

28

mill owned and run by the Reymond
brothers.

  In those days there was a class of people
called" river-traders, who depended for their
living 011 the money picked up from people
along the banks of the river. Near Fort
Leavenworth, these traders were very numer-
ous. Their stores were supposed to be
stocked with what the men from the fort
would be most apt to demand.

  The trading buildings were not built 011
the ground, but were afloat on the river.
First there would be a long, wide, flat-bot-
tomed boat, from fifty to seventy feet in
length and fort)’ feet wide; then a house
built on this, with just place enough left on
the ends and sides to work the paddles that
kept the boat guided in its drifting down
stream.

  Nearly all of those trading-boats were
called “gunboats.” Those tied up near the
fort were all loaded with liquors and just
enough little knickknacks to make a show.
The owners did not dare to tie up on the
Kansas side very near the fort, but 011 the
Missouri side they were safe. The traders
were desperadoes and outlaws—many df
whom had a price 011 their heads.
282

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

  One big. ugly fellow named Jack Dim-
ming had what was known as the ‘worst den
on the river. When a neighborhood got too
hot for him lie would let go his lines at night
and drop down the river to some other mili-
tary camp or railroad outfit. Jack Dim-
ming had been as far up stream as Fort
Benton, and had been dropping down and
down until he was tied up about half a mile
below Fort Leavenworth 011 the Missouri
side.

Aboard a “ Gunboat.”

  Dimming had everything on his beat that
was calculated to draw a reckless man.
There was a dance on board every night.
Many a time I have heard the mad music of
the horns and fiddles and the laughter of
whisky-crazed men and women across the
long space of water, while I stood on guard.

  Dimming had four or five fellow despera-
does with him. every sheriff knew that he
would have to get the drop on Dimming, as
he would not be taken alive.

  The soldiers at the fort were forbidden
to “go over the Rhine” as it was called, but
they went just the same. Jack Malone, one
of the privates, seemed to be very friendly
with Dimming. He was on Dimming’s boat
every spare moment he could get. By de-
grees he began to go there on time that was
not his. He would neglect roll-call and
duty.

  First, his commander called him up and
talked to him; next, he was punished, but
all to no purpose. He would take any risk
to get away.

   Still, his commanding officer hesitated to
be severe. One reason why Malone was so
leniently dealt with was the fact that he was
a veteran and had been a faithful man.
Finally, severe discipline was meted out to
him. He was ordered to carry a heavy log
on his shoulder four hours on and two off
during twenty-four hours.

Malone Makes a Promise.

  Even this did not stop him, and lie was
swung up by the wrists for ten hours. While
undergoing this terrible punishment Gene-
ral Buell, the commander of the fort, stop-
ped and asked Malone what he had done
to cause such punishment.

  It was an old saying in the army that
the soldier’s answer was, “nothin'.” so that
a soldier’s crime is known as “nothin’.”

  This time. Jack told the simple truth.

He seemed to be sorry as well as ashamed
of his conduct, and the general.admonished
him and secured his promise that he would
stay away from the “gunboat.”

  When Malone made this promise, the
general ordered him cut down. He then
gave orders that Malone be immediately re-
ported if he disobeyed.

  One morning, Private Malone was re-
ported absent and not accounted for. That
night, he did not show up at retreat or
taps. The next morning, as the men were
turning out for reveille, we saw him gli-
ding from tree to tree in his endeavor to
gain the ranks, unseen by the first sergeant.
He managed to slip into ranks, but as he
answered to his name he was told to step
to the front.

  His captain spoke a few words to him
in a low tone, then a guard was called and
Malone was sent to the guard-house. He
looked more like a fitting subject for the
hospital.

  Acting under orders from General Buell,
the provost sergeant prepared die punish-
ment which was to break him from again
visiting Jack Dimming. Malone was strip-
ped and a barrel, with a hole cut in one end
just large enough to pass down over his
head and rest on his shoulders, was put on
him. Then he was marched, under guard,
lo a large cottonwood-tree.

Left to His Thoughts.

  An opening was made in the barrel so
his wrists could be tied behind him. This
was done with a piece of rope. The rope
was thrown over a limb of the tree and
pulled until Malone was bent over almost
double. It was then made fast to the tree,
and Jack Malone was left to his thoughts.

  The day was a broiling one in July. An
old sugar-barrel had been purposely used.
This caused flies and mosquitoes to add
to the punishment.

   About an hour before first call for dress
parade General Buell walked over to the
tree.

  “ Well. 'Malone, how do you like this
kind of duty?” he remad^d.

“ Not very well, general,” he answered.

   “ Do you think it better to remain in the
fort and attend to your duty or to go over
to the gunboat?”

   “ It is better to do my duty, general.”

  “Hereafter you will do your duty like a
man ? ”
A FRONTIER MAN-HUNT.

283

  “ Yes, general.”

  “Now, Malone, do you really mean to
say that you won’t go over to the gunboat
again, if I let you down now ? ”

  “ Yes, general, I really mean that T will
never go there again.'"

  “Well, I will now let you down, but bear
in mind that should you again go there, this
day’s punishment is only a foretaste of
what you will get. You
will now go to your
quarters and get ready
for dress parade — and
let me see that you do
attend dress parade.”

  “ Oh. yes, General
Buell, you may be sure
I will be there.”

  The guard that was
over Malone and heard
him say the words, said
long afterward that he
knew that the suffering
prisoner meant no good
to General Buell. Ma-
lone staggered to his
quarters, and not long
after the bugle sounded
first call for dress pa-
rade.

  It was a fine evening,
and a large crowd had
come from the city. A
twelve - company fort,
with a good band of mu-
sic, presents quite a
lively scene at dress pa-
rade. I was out on duty
this day, and was sitting
with two others in full
view of everything that
went on.

  Just after parade was
dismissed and the com-
panies were returning to
their barracks, I saw
Malone leave the ranks,
and, with his gun at a
trail, start on a run for headquarters. In
the confusion of the breaking up of the
parade no attention was paid to the desper-
ate man.

  It struck me like a flash that he was bent
on murder. I kept my eyes on him, but
of course could do nothing in the way of
stopping him nor giving a warning shout,
for I was too far away.

  He ran like an antelope. At one place

he was compelled to lower his head in
order to break through a group of people.
He was about ten yards from General
Buell.

   Something caused that officer to stop and
turn half way around, probably the cock-
ing of Malone’s rifle. In that moment he
must have realized that his time had come.
His wife and little girl were with him.

DIMMING HAD EVERYTHING ON HIS BOAT THAT WAS CALCULATED TO
DRAW A RECKLESS MAN.

Mrs. Buell raised her hands and screamed.
Malone dropped down, on one knee, took
deliberate aim and fired. He jumped to
his feet and started on a mad run for the
woods.

  General Buell sank, his hand clasping
the bullet in his breast.

  “Some one give me a pistol, that I may
kill my assassin.” he gasped. Those were
his last words; he died in a few minutes.
284

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

  Malone had vanished in die grove over-
looking the river.

J In an instant, people were running in
every direction and officers were shouting
to the men to arm themselves and give
chase. In half an hour, except for the
guards, there was hardly a man left in the
fort.

The Hunt Begins.

  There was little doubt that Malone would
be captured at once. Although it was
nearly all woods along the bank of the
river, it was entirely free of underbrush;,
yet it was conceded that if Malone gained
the Missouri side and got into the dense
timber he would be hard to find. For this
reason, men were hurried across the river in
boats and placed at short distances along
the edge of the far bank to head him off if
he took that direction; but. strange as it
may seem, not a sign of Malone was found.

  All night diere were torches flaming in
the woods; along the railroad was a picket
line of watching men; boats were patrol-
ina the river; but when davlisht came Ma-
lone was still at large.

  Jack Dimming and his gunboat had dis-
appeared. fie had heard the news and very
discreetly dropped down the river, although
lie knew nothing of Malone’s deed until
told by some of the men giving-chase. He
did not care, however, to brave the furi-
ous people.

  It seemed very strange that Malone was
able to evade all his pursuers. It was im-
possible for him to get above the fort, for
as soon as he went out of sight in the
grove a line of guards was'strung all along
from the fort to the river bank and another
string of men along the main drive between
the fort and the city. All this made it
pretty sure that he must be still in the long
piece of woods which lay between the fort
and the city.

Escape Seemed Impossible.

  Guards were doubled and the _ police
of neighboring towns were brought into
service. It seemed that Malone must lie
caught, even if he were a rabbit. All night
the big posse hunted and all the next day
until well into the afternoon—and still
Malone was not caught. Every one was
worn out, so a strong guard was left at
points where the alarm could be given
should he be seen.

   When the first shock of excitement was
 over, the officers of the fort held a council
 with Mrs. Buell. As it became clear that
 Malone was not to be found at once, as
 was so confidently expected at first, Mrs.
 Buell caused notices to be posted that she
 would give a reward of $500 to the naan
 who captured him.

   The next day the State of Kansas offered

 SI,000 more, and to this the government
 added still $1,000. In all $2,500 was the
 reward for any one who would bring Ma-
 lone in, dead or alive.

   The heartbroken wife left for her home
 with her husband's body. As day after
 day passed and there seemed no prospect of
 arresting Malone, the excitement died out;
 but the tireless search went on.

   In the early evening of the ninth day, one
 of the soldiers named Kelly, while on* his
 way to the fort after a leave of absence,
 stepped down from the railroad track to
 get a drink of water from a spring. After
 drinking, Kelly stretched himself on the
 grass' to rest.

The Whisper in the Bushes.

   As he Jay there he heard a rustle in the
 bushes. He did not stand up but lay still,
 listening. Being off duty, he was un-
 armed.

   For a time all was still. Kelly began to
 think diat his imagination had played him
 a trick; and he settled down again when in
 a hoarse whisper he heard—“Kelly.”

   Startled, yet cool, he answered, “What
 is it? What do you want?” at the same
 time jumping to his feet It struck him
 that it was Malone, whose voice he knew
 ' well. He waited alnd listened for an-
 other call but heard nothing.

   Those who knew Malone declared that
 he would not be taken alive if he had time
 to fight. All knew him to be well armed
 and. as every man is supposed to have his
 cartridge box filled when undergoing in-
 spection on dress parade, he had plenty of
 ammunition. To accost him unarmed
 meant sudden death.

   The man at the spring, standing there
 weaponless, felt that he was standing in
 full sight of the desperate man who, from
 his pla-ce of concealment, could shoot him
 down should he deem it best for his own
 safety.

   It is not pleasant to be under the trig-
 ger—yet Kelly kept his nerve.
A FRONTIER MAN-HUNT.

285

  Again he called, “Who is it calls
me, and what is it you want?”

  No doubt Malone was hungry. He
had now been in hiding nine days and
nights, and it was hardly possible he
had eaten much.

  It is a fact that Malone from his
hiding-place saw Kelly, and his first
impulse was to trust him to name a
point of meeting, and have him bring
him something to eat; but, after call-
ing, something in Kelly’s actions
warned the outlaw that the soldier
would betray him, and lie changed his
mind.

  Kelly turned to go up the path to the
railroad. Malone was anxious to de-
stroy any idea that he may have cre-
ated in Kelly’s mind that he had called
to him. Malone did not relish the
thought of another close searching
party. He ran back while Kelly had
his back turned, and when he thought
a proper distance separated them, dis-
guised his voice and spoke in broken
German, asking “ How var vas it yet
to dot fort?”

  Kelly stopped, looked back, but see-
ing no one, said: “Mile and a half. ^
Where are you ? ”	he

  Malone replied, “ I vas up near dis
road in deni bushes. Don't you see
me yet already? Say now, vat you dink?
Me could enlist if I go oup dere? "

  Kelly now knew that Malone was talk-
ing to him, but had the presence of mind
to keep it to himself. He answered care-
lessly, “Oh, yes. I do see you now', I
think; but your coat looks so much like the
brown dirt in the bank behind you I did
not see you at first. As to joining the serv-
ice. if you are the right age, height, and so
forth, I guess' it will be no trouble to join.
Better come along with me; I am going
back to the fort now.”

  As he said this, Kelly scrambled up the
steep path to the railroad and down the
other side to the river bank. He did this
to get out of range of Malone’s gun for,
as he told it afterward, he could “feel
Jack’s eyes on him.”

  Hearing no more of Malone. Kelly made
good time to the fort and reported all to
his first sergeant. He was then taken to
the officer of the day to whom he related
his story.

  All was excitement again. A large squad
of men were ordered down on the double-

VVAS ORDERED TO CARRY A HEAVY LOG ON HIS
SHOULDER FOUR HOURS ON AND TWO OFF.

quick to the cottonwood spring, but be-
fore they arrived there it was dark.

  A big culvert ran under the railroad em-
bankment near the spring, through which
ran a small creek that followed a gully
from the big hills behind the fort. Along
this gully was very thick brush, in which,
though it had been pretty well explored
before, Malone was possibly lurking.

  But there was no Malone. All was dark
and silent as ever. All through the night
the other guards lay waiting in the wet
grass along each side of this gully.

Roach’s Silent Comrade.

  About one hour before daylight. Sergeant
Roach, while patroling near the river was
hailed by another guard in a whisper, say-
ing, “Is there any sign of Malone yet?”

  “No,” he answered. .

  Then the two kept on down the gully
until, coming to a picket post, they were
challenged for the countersign. The word
was given by the sergeant, the other man
standing near enough to catch it.
286

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

  While the sergeant stood talking to the
man on picket the stranger muttered some
excuse, then kept on down the gully toward
the river. As he passed on, the picket
said to Roach : “ Who is that man ? ”
“Don't know; too dark to see his face,”
replied Roach.

  “Wasn’t he with you? I swear there
is something up! Did you notice he did
not speak and kept in the background?”

  “ And the voice! ” added Roach. “ When
he spoke he seemed to smother his words.”
“Halt, there! Halt!” they both shouted,
but got no answer.

   Listening, they could distinctly hear the
hurrying footsteps going down the creek.

  “ If I was not 011 post here I would try
to overtake that njan again,” said the
picket, “ for I believe that one minute ago
Jack Malone stood right there.”

  “My God!” exclaimed Roach, “if that
is so, I have been walking with him and
I helped him to get out of the trap!”
“Go!” interrupted the picket. “Hurry!
Maybe you are not too late yet.”

  Sergeant Roach started to run, plunging
along so that when he was challenged by
the next picket, and not hearing the call
the .first time, he was nearly fired on.

MALONE DROPPED DOWN ON ONE KNEE, TOOK DELIBERATE
AIM, AND FIRED.

  On coming up and giving the counter-
sign, he panted, “Have you seen any one?
Which way did he go?”

  Yes,” said the otiier picket, “one of the
boys went by a minute ago, heading toward
the river.”

  “Did he give the countersign?”

  “ Of course he did, or 1 would not let
him pass.”

  Sergeant Roach hurried on after his late
companion, and soon encountered the last
picket between himself and the river. Con-
sulting him, Roach found that the mysteri-
ous man had been there and gone on to the
river.

  “What did he say to you?” asked
Roach.

  “ Said he had special orders to take a
post on the bank of the river further down
toward the city,” said the picket.

On a Real Scent.

  The mysterious man had told Roach a
different story, and there was now no^ioubt
that he was Jack Malone.

  The two soldiers went to the railroad
track, it being but a short distance from
the last picket’s post.

  As they listened
they could hear the
patter of feet up the
track—the man was
running.

  So sure were they
that it was the as-
sassin that they
shouted. Not getting
any response, they
fired up the track.

  This alarmed the
searching party in
the neighbor-
liood. Many rushed
to join Roach and
the picket. Roach
followed the fleeing
man, firing as he
went. Others fol-
lowed, but Malone
must have slipped
down the dump and
hid in the bushes be-
tween the railroad
and the river and let
Sergeant Roach pass
him. Once more he
had disappeared.
A FRONTIER MAN-HUNT.

  Fires were built all
along the bank of the
river; the alarm reached
the fort and all turned
out; the grove was full
of men! Day soon
dawned, and men with
guns could b& seen ev-
erywhere. The excite-
ment was intense. If
a shot was heard, all
would rush to the spot.

This state - of affairs
lasted until nine o’clock
in the morning.

  At this time, the
railroad bridge across
the Missouri River near
the fort was in course
of construction. One of
the iron piers on the
Kansas side near the
fort, about two hun-
dred feet from shore,
had fallen, ancl a big
bell-boat, the “ Subma-
rine No. 14,” was
anchored in the stream,
working on the fallen
pier. The crew on this
boat were on the cabin
deck watching the sol-
diers on shore. An old fisherman named
Williams was sitting in his skiff drifting
down the stream watching his lines.

The Voice in the Darkness.

  Not being in the man-hunt, I was by
the wrecked pier walking along the rail-
road. I accosted two young men standing
near a rowboat that belonged to another
wrecking vessel that was anchored in the
middle of the river.

  These two men, members of the wreck-
ing crew, had brought their captain ashore
and were waiting until he should get ready
to go aboard again. Seeing that I was a
soldier, they hailed me and wanted a de-
scription of Malone. They said that three
nights running, a man had called to them
for some one to come ashore and row him
over the river.	.

  I talked with the men for some time and
made up my mind that Malone was the
man who had been calling to them in the
night.

TAPPED HIS SPENCER CARBINE SIGNIFI-
CANTLY AND SHOOK HIS FINGER AT ME.

                   As I looked up the
river, I saw the old fel-
low, "Williams, sitting
in his fishing boat drop-
ping down with the cur-
rent, his lines out for
fish. It was reported
that he had seen Ma-
lone drown while try-
ing to swim the river.

  I made up my mind
to ask him about it. I
walked along to get
nearer and beckoned to
him to pull into the
shore. He dfd not no-
tice me. He seemed to
be looking intently down
the stream. I looked in
the direction of his eyes.

  There was Jack Ma-
lone.

  For a moment I could
not believe my eyes.
Yet there he was,
crouched under a little
bush.

 When he saw me
looking at him, he put
his fingers to his lips,
then tapped his Spen-

•	cer carbine significantly
and shook his finger at me in a threatening
manner.

  Being a cavalryman, I have always had
great admiration for the Spencer carbine,
but just then my respect for the one in
Jack Malone’s hands was something pro-
found. I was on my way to the city on
a twenty-four hour pass, and so I was
unarmed.

  To make a move toward the desperate
man against such odds would have been
suicide. I did just what Malone wanted
me to—“ nothin’.”

  I looked at Malone and Malone looked
at me. As he sat watching me and, also,
keeping an eye on old Williams, I noticed
that he was dressed differently than when
he ran by me out of the fort.

  At that time, he wore a dress coat and
cap; he now had on a common fatigue
blouse and a campaign hat. The brass
buttons were gone from the blouse. Across
his knees, instead of the long infantry
needle-gun with which he had killed Gen-
eral Buell, he had a Spencer carbine.
288

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

  When the old fisherman came down op-
posite' him. Malone spoke in a low, quick
voice, telling him to pull in and ferry him
over the river. This was part of the old
man’s business, but he declined on account
of his fish lines, saying he would lose
them. Malone said:

   “ I will give you two dollars for the job,
and vou can easily overtake vour fishing
lines.-”

Jumps into the Boat.

  The lines were attached to - air-tight
cans. Malone’s offer had the desired ef-
fect. Letting go the lines, Williams guided
his boat inshore, little knowing the awful
character of the passenger he was about to
take on board.

  As the stern of the skiff grated on the
sand, Malone stood up, stretched his
cramped legs, stepped in and quyekly seat-
ed himself in the stern. He ordered the
old man to pull for the bell-boat. His idea
was this: If he could get the big boat be-
tween himself and the shore he was leav-
ing. his' chances of escape would be very
much better.

  Being out of range of the Spencer car-
bine, I started up the river-bank. As I
gained the railroad. I saw the grove full
of armed soldiers, some running, others
peeking into and under every bush and
possible hiding-place.

  It was evident that some one besides my-
self had seen the hunted man and given the
alarm. At this moment some one yelled:
“There he is! There he is!”

  Malone, in full view and range, was
crouched up double in the boat. In one
hand he held the carbine, with the muz-
zle within ten inches of the poor old fish-
erman’s heart; with the other, he was
-leering the boat so as to put the wreck-
ing vessel between him and the men 011 the
bank.

  Volley after volley burst out from the
bank, but the boat in spire of all went on
untouched.

  One of the officers yelled. “ Silence! ”
Then he shouted to Williams:

  “Old man, that fellow in your boat is
Tack Malone who killed General Buell!
Turn your skiff inshore! We do not wish
to kill you! If you do not. you must
take j’our chances!”

  All this time Malone said to the fisher-
man :

  “ The first move you make toward the
Kansas shore, I will blow the heart out of
you! ”

  The old man was as white as chalk. He
was scared so bad that he could hardly
hold the oars. He knew it was sure death
to disobey the desperate man in the boat,
yet at any instant both of them would
probably be riddled from the shore. But
of the two, Malone’s carbine was the most
dangerous, so he kept on rowing.

  It was pitiful to see that feeble old man
tugging at the oars. The agony on his face
could be seen plainly by the 'crew of the
bell-boat, whose captain, Joe Snodgrass,
ordered to stand out of danger from the
shower of bullets.

  The water near the skiff was in a bubble
from the bullets. Every moment it was
expected that the men in the skiff would be
shot to pieces, but on they went.

  The officers swore at the soldiers, and
declared that they were not trying to hit
the murderer. They grabbed the muskets
from the soldiers’ hands, ordered men to
stand while they rested die guns on their
shoulders for a better aim.

  Then they hit the skiff and all arouifd
it. They even brought a trickle of blood
down the old rower’s ghastly face, but the
boat went 011 as if it were armor-clad.

Between Two Fires.

  The soldiers were now frantic.. Some
ran up-stream to the boat-house to procure
more boats, while others fired faster than
ever.

  The skiff was now in the swift current
made by the anchored bell-boat. It swung
down and around the stern of the big
craft, then passed behind it, out of sight
and range.

  With others not in the chase, I scram-
bled to the top of the pier of the bridge.
There I had a complete view of the other
side of the river and of the skiff and its
two passengers. Malone must have had a
charmed life. Although not over two hun-
dred yards away when the firing began, he
had succeeded in getting the bell-boat be-
tween him and the shore without his
being hit.

  Malone now allowed the old man to take
it more easy. From their movements, it
could be seen that he was undecided just
which way to steer—up or down the river
or make a landing.
A FRONTIER MAN-HUNT.

289

  Big timber and safety were just ahead;
but between him and it were four men,
sawmill hands from Slab City.

  They had heard the firing; they had been
watching the chase and knew their man
and the reward on his head. But Malone
was well armed, a good shot, cool and des-
perate. Death was behind him, and the
four sawmill hands were nothing to him.
Malone had just defied a regiment; but now
only three men cared to close with him.

At the Water’s Edge.

  These men were the two Reymond broth-
ers, who owned the sawmill at Slab City,
and one of their employees. They ran to
the shore, and then walked along so as to
meet Malone when his boat landed.

  The fugitive made an attempt to land
but some move by the three men made him
change his mind, and he steered the boat
so as to get a range on them without being
in danger of hitting old man Williams.

  Even in his own deadly peril, Malone
had no wish to see the old man hurt. He
sought to keep him
out of danger as much
as possible, yet he
would have killed him
instantly himself if
it had been neces-
sary to aid his es-
cape. For one mo-
ment the frightened
fisherman stopped
rowing, but Malone
raised the carbine and
ordered him ahead.

  As the boat neared
the bank, the Rey-
monds spoke words
of encouragement to
Malone which threw
him off his guard.

  The hunted man
stood up to leave the
skiff. One of the Rey-
monds suddenly
whipped out a hidden
revolver and fired.

  He was not more
than fifteen or twenty
feet from Malone, and
t[ie bullet went true.

  Malone swayed un-
steadily for several
moments, and tried to

   7	R R

raise the carbine, but toppled over back-
ward.

  The Reymonds fired again, rushed into
the water, grabbed the boat and struck the
fallen man in the head with a revolver as
he made a last attempt to rise.

  Malone lay still. They lifted him—one
by the feet, the other under the armpits—
and carried him onto the bank.

  One of the Reymond brothers turned to
the old fisherman and shook his hand.
Except a bullet tear along the left side of

his face, the ugly scar of which he carried
to his grave, the exhausted old man was
unharmed. The Reymonds then hoisted the
limp man on their shoulders and started
on a dog-trot up the river-bank until they
reached the railroad depot opposite the
fort. Then they put their prisoner into a
skiff, to avoid all the other bpats, and
placed him in the hospital.

Jack Malone’s Last Hours.

  Malone was dumped on the floor, the hos-
pital steward made a hasty examination
and found two bullet wounds, one through
the left lung and one in the neck. Either
would prove fatal. A bad cut on the top
of his head showed where the butt of the
revolver had landed.

  The Reymond brothers hurried over to
the adjutant’s office for their money.

  The post doctor seeing the wounded
prisoner on the hospital floor said. “Take
this carrion out of my office! ”

  Malone looked up at the doctor and with
a bitter smile said something so low that
he was not understood.

  They took him to the guard-house. There
the dying man was placed on a board bunk
and to his old comrades who crowded
around him he told some astonishing things.

  Without betraying any one he made it
clear that all the rumors about his being
seen in and around the fort on nights after
the tragedy were correct. It was in this
way that he changed his gun and clothes.
He even had been into his own barrack-
room and secured an undershirt and a
change of socks from his bunk.

  To do this it was not necessary to pass a
guard as the posts were not very close to-
gether, yet for a man who had a price on his
head for killing a LTnited States general,
who was being hunted by hundreds of
men, to go into the very heart of the fort,
not once but three times, and even to his

own bunk and out again, seems more than
passing strange!

  His hiding place during the day was a
little hole between two big stones in the
woods not over half a mile below the fort.
Afterward, we visited it. At first sight,
it did not seem possible that a man could
conceal himself in so small a place; but the
stone had a sharp shelf and Malone, by-
lying at full length, could slide in so as
to be entirely concealed. There he could
sleep quite comfortable, while the whole
country hunted him.

Wanted a Second Victim.

  At two different times, Malone joined in
the chase with the others, when by l>ring
still he would have been captured.

  But lie could not get a boat to cross the
river in-the night, and he could not swim.

  When asked why he did not make great-
er efforts to get away in the darkness of the
night, he answered that he did not care to
live with a price on his head. It was gath-
ered from what he said, that his intention
was to kill another officer in the fort before
being taken, then, to show himself and get
killed by resisting arrest, as he would not
be taken alive and stand for trial and exe-
cution.

  Although he did not give the name of the
second officer he wanted to kill, it was sup-'
posed from his dying talk in the guard-
house, that it was the doctor who insulted
him while lie was lying wounded on the
floor and who refused to aid him in his
agony under the tree.

  He regretted killing General Buell and

PORTABLE ELECTRIC STATION.

TO send a heavy electric current over a long
distance requires a heavy wire; and copper
costs money. Power companies therefore distribute
current over large areas by transmitting it at high
voltage, but low current to points where needed,
and then change it to low voltage in what are
called “ sub-stations,” after which it goes out over
other wires to customers. An interesting portable

sub-station built by the Westinghouse company
is now in operation on the lines of the Fort
Wayne and Wabash Valley Traction Company,
the whole equipment being contained in an all-
steel car forty feet long. Whenever curreiu is
needed in construction-work, the car is sent out
and connection made to a high voltage-line instead
of the trolley-wire.—Popular Electricity.
THE ALCOHOL ANNIHILATOR

BY AUGUSTUS WITTFELD.

         Carlock Bjones, Detective, Does Some Inventing
         as Well as Sleuthing, with the Customary Results.

S chronicler of the remarkable
achievements of Carlock
Bjones, the talented de-
tective of the Pole-to-
Pole Railway, I am con-
scious that the public will
not stand for any flirting with the God-
dess of Fiction, neither will it tolerate
any wildly improbable tales of impossible
adventure.

  Consequently, as historian of the great
detective, I am compelled to omit many
tilings which I know to be true but which
the public, through its ignorance of crime,
would stigmatize as fiction-faking, and
consign me to the oblivion which seems
to be the limbo of the too-truthful or too-
accurate biographer. *

  Rather than offend by overestimating the
public’s credulity, I will eliminate all
seemingly impossible adventures from
these chronicles, but shall reserve the right
of making them as forceful as is consist-
ent with a reputation for veracity.

  The following, which I have compiled
from data in my note-book, exhibits the
great detective in a new light.

  I pushed the button of Carlock’s an-
nunciator at one-thirty, and again pushed
it impatiently at one-thirty-and-a-quarter.
At one-thirty-sixteen Carlock’s voice
floated down the tube:	,

  “Ah, Watchem, come up.”

  In my astonishment, I swallowed my
impatience, and taking the lift, I was soon
in Carlock’s apartments. I found him
leaning over a table in the center of his
chemical laboratory.

  “Ah, Watchem,” he said, “you are in
a hurry. What train are you thinking of
taking to the Muttonhead race-track?”
With difficulty I caught my breath,

which his sudden question had knocked
completely out of me.

  “ How do you know that I am going to
the race-track ? ” I gasped.

  “ Dead easy,” he replied. “ I know you
are in a hurry by the way you pushed the
button. You are never in a hurry unless
you are seeking pleasure. Your only form
of pleasure seems to be in picking the
horses that can run away with your money.
Consequently, you are bound for Mutton-
head Bay.”

  “ Marvelous,” I commented. “ Per-
haps you can tell me what horse I have
picked.”

  “With a brain like yours, Watchem,”
he replied, “you are incapable of picking
anything but a loser. Now, if you want
to put your money on a winner, I would
advise that you invest it in this remark-
able discovery I have just made. Take it
from me, it’s got the hundred-to-one shots
looking like the discard in a poker game.”
“What is the nature of this great dis-
covery, Carlock ? ” I asked.

  “Watchem,” he replied, “ you have
often scoffed at my assertion that some
day I would make a discovery which
would astound the scientific world and
make the achievements^ of the master
minds of chemistry look like two bits and
a nickel. As you pushed the annunciator-
button, I had just brought to a success-
ful termination the work 011 which I have
been engaged. In a short time the scien-
tific world will be endeavoring to grasp
the full significance of my discgvery.”
“What have you discovered, Carlock?”
I asked.

  “Watchem,” he replied, “I have dis-
covered a compound which possesses the
most remarkable property known, or rather

unknown, to chemistry. I have blazed a
way along an unthought path. While the
reputed master minds of science have
groped for the perfection of illusive ideas,
I have pursued my researches along this
one line. To you, Watchem, shall belong
the proud honor of being the first to know
of my discovery.

  “ Of course, as my biographer, the
honor is rightly yours. Nevertheless, it is
an honor of which you should be proud.
When, in future years, the world pays a
tardy debt of recognition to my genius,
and you, Watchem, are reaping your re-
ward in the royalties which your ‘ Chron-
icles ’ will bring, the world at large will
remember the great Carlock Bjones for
his unparalled work in criminology, but
the scientific world will remember him
and reverence his name for this one great
discovery.”

  “ Carlock,” I appealed, “ can’t you stop
throwing confetti at yourself sufficiently
long to put an end to the suspense I am
suffering and tell me what you have dis-
covered ? ”

  “ I have discovered,” said Carlock im-
pressively, “ a compound which possesses
the most remarkable attraction or affinity
for alcohol.”

  “Great guns! Carlock,” I commented,
“ you don’t have to hunt for anything like
that in a chemical laboratory. Why, I
just turned down an alcoholic affinity who
tried to work me for the medium where-
with to consummate a union of the ele-
ments.”

  “Seriously, Watchem,” said Carlock,
“this discovery is something phenomenal.
Its magnitude overwhelms me. When I
think of the possibilities of this discovery
in a perfected state, I realize that I have
something which will revolutionize life.”

  “How does the substance work?” I
asked, interrupting Carlock’s rhapsody in
“I major; no flats.”

  “Let me demonstrate to you,” replied
Carlock, holding up a wide-mouthed,
glass-stoppered bottle. “This jar contains
a white powder, as you can see. Place the
jar in the same room with a botde or ves-
sel containing alcohol, either absolute or
diluted to the limit, and uncork both bot-
tles. In less time than it takes to tell the
alcohol will have entirely disappeared.”

  “Say, Carlock,” I protested, “I’m not
from Saint Looey, but, all the same, I’d
appreciate an ocular demonstration.”

  “That is what I propose giving you,”
he replied.

  He took a bottle of alcohol and poured
four ounces into a graduate. Replacing
the cork in the bottle, he next poured the
alcohol into a small earthen dish or cap-
sule. Then he placed the jar containing
the powder on the scales and weighed it.

  “ Exactly two pounds, including the
stopper,” he announced. “When I re-
move the stopper from the jar, I shall place
it on the scales with the jar so that the
weight will remain unchanged. Are you
ready for the demonstration?”

  “ I am,” I replied. “ Proceed with your
mysteries.”

  “Keep your eye on the alcohol,” in-
structed Carlock, deftly removing the
stopper and placing it on the scales.

  I watched the alcohol closely. Almost
immediately it seemed to grow less in vol-
ume. In less than a minute, I was gazing
at the empty capsule.

  “What has become of it?” I asked.
“What’s the trick?”

  “No trick at all,” replied Carlock.
“You will note that the weight of the pow-
der and jar remains the same. The pow-
der attracts the alcohol but does not absorb
it, otherwise its weight would be increased
by four ounces.”

  “But what has become of it?” I per-
sisted.

  “ It has been destroyed. Dissipated into
the atmosphere,” replied Carlock.

  “But what’s the use?” I asked. “I
don’t see the utility of a substance which
destroys but does not produce. It seems
to me that you have a gnld-bri^k on your
hands.”

  “Not necessarily,” replied Carlock.
“Even as it stands, there is a diversity of
uses to which it might be put. Carried
to the point of the perfection I have in
mind, this substance could be taken into
the fields and with appropriate apparatus
I could extract the alcohol directly from
the growing grain and store it in con-
tainers.

  “To your unscientific mind this may
sound like an idle boast, but you have only
to look at the achievements of recent years
to realize that seeming impossibilities are
being accomplished daily. In a very few
years, Carlock Bjones’s Alcohol Extractor
will be recognized by science and hold an
established place in the world.

  “ And Carlock Bjones will be posing as
THE ALCOHOL

ANNIHILATOR.

a rival to Petroleum V. Rockefeller and
trying to devise ways and means to get rid
of his ill-gotten gains.

  “ And you, Watchem, as my biographer,
will be investing in a biograph machine to
keep up with the pace.”

  “ Say, Carlock,” I said, suddenly struck
with an idea, “ how would you like to try
a novel experiment with your great dis-
covery?”

  “ What kind of experiment ? ” he asked.

  “ I’ll hunt up that ‘ souse ’ I spoke of
a while ago,” I replied. “ If I find him,
I’ll bring him up here and we will test
your wonderful discovery and see whether
it will relieve him of his jag. If it is a
success you could open up an office and do
a big business unloading the victims of con-
viviality.”

  “Watchem,” said Carlock, “once in a
decade or so, that brain of yours does pro-
duce an original thought. Go and find
the subject and we will make the experi-
ment in the interest of science.”

  I left Carlock’s apartments and had no
difficulty locating the “souse,” and pre-
vailing on him to accompany me to his
doom. When I ushered him into Car-
lock’s apartments his condition was so
obvious that the great detective refrained
from making any of his deductions.

  “What kind of a joint is this?” asked
the “souse.” “Got anything to drink?”

  Carlock opened a cupboard and took
from it a bottle of whisky and glasses.
He placed them on the table and invited
the victim to offer up a sacrifice on the
altar of Bacchus. The “souse” filled his
glass and sighed because there was no more
room for filling. Carlock and I poured
out homeopathic doses and we did the
tipplers’ trio.

  “Pretty slick stuff,” said the “souse”
insinuatingly.

  “ Yes,” said Carlock, placing the alcohol
annihilator on the table. “Have an-
other?”

  “ I don’t care if I do,” replied the
“souse.”	—

  He poured himself another drink as Car-
lock removed the stopper from the jar.
By the time he raised the glass to his lips,
Carlock’s alcohol magnet had taken all the
stiffness out of it, and a puzzled expression
crossed his face as he gulped it down.

  “What kind of a temperance beverage is
this you’re ringing in on me?” he asked.

  “It’s out of the same bottle as the other

drink,” answered Carlock. “ Is there any-
thing the matter with it?”

  “Is there anything the matter with it?”
repeated the “souse.” “Why, that stuff
has lost its nationality—it’s neither Scotch,
Irish, Bourbon, nor plain American. I
didn’t come up here to be made a guy of,”
and he lapsed into silence.

  Carlock and I watched him with interest,
awaiting evidence of the efficiency of the
Alcohol Annihilator. Presently he . began
to lose his bloated, alcoholic appearance
and his bleary eyes became brighter.

  As the alcohol was drawn from his satu-
rated system and brain, he seemed to un-
dergo a metamorphosis. In less than five
minutes, the “souse,” who had entered
rum-soaked, sodden and maudlin, sat be-
fore us a perfect specimen of manhood.

   “ How in the blazes did I get rid of that
beautiful bun I was carrying?” he asked.

  “ I had not noticed that you were carry-
ing any bakery product,” said Carlock.

  “ Sure, I was,” he replied. “ Maybe you
thought it was a load of peaches or that
I was full of prunes. The fact is, I was
burdened with a most beautiful jag—
‘ j-a-g jag. Synonyms: souse, pickled,
bun, skate. Where is it? Who’s got it?”
“My dear fellow,” said Carlock, “per-
haps you have mislaid or spilled it. If
you had it when you entered, you should
have it now. Neither Watchem or myself
has any use for" a second-hand jag, I as-
sure you. If you must persist in drink-
ing, you should study Professor Boozem’s
‘ How to Take Care of a Jag When You
Get One.’ It is my opinion that you are
a novice in the art; a rank amateur.”
The ex-tank looked at Carlock as though
he half believed him. Then, looking at the
jar of Alcohol Annihilator suspiciously,
picked up his hat and departed.

  “ Say, Carlock,” I remarked when we
were alone, “ that was the slickest thing I
ever witnessed. You’ve got the temperance
reformers beat to a fringe. The way you
robbed that poor inebriate of his rightful
jag was a shame. Why don’t you use your
great discovery for the redemption of such
cases and give up the idea of using it for
production of alcohol ? ”

  “Watchem,” replied Carlock, “you are
not a scientist, consequently you cannot
appreciate the lure of an idea. To a scien-
tist, the conception of an idea is the birth
of a new existence.

  “No, Watchem, I cannot renounce what
294

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

is to me an alluring proposition. I would
be glad to use it as you suggest, but that
would necessitate, letting the scientific world
into my secret and the time is not yet ripe
for a move of that kind.”

  I backed toward the door, knowing that
when Carlock waxed monologuistic it was
me for the maddening crowd.

  “ I’ll see you in the morning,” I called
as I dodged out of the door. “ I’m off.”

  I reached Muttonhead race-track in time
for the last event. By a juggling of the
fates, I won fifty dollars. I had intended
putting a fiver on “ India Rubber,” and
when I rushed up to the bookmaker I
thought I would save time by talking short-
hand, so I asked for a ticket on “ Rubber.”
The bookie pushed the ticket toward me.
Parting with my money, I pocketed the
pasteboard and rushed over to see the race.

  As I squeezed into a point of vantage,
the horses started. I had no trouble in
locating “ India Rubber ” who, to my dis-
gust, was trailing along as if he were
made of lead. After the race, the crowd
was yelling for “Rubberneck.”

  I took the ticket from my pocket, in-
tending to destroy all evidence of my fool-
ishness, when I discovered that fate and a
blundering bookmaker had done what tal-
ent and brains could not accomplish. I
had staked my money on “ India Rubber,”
but I held a ticket for “ Rubberneck,” the
winner—a ten-to-one shot.

  I cashed in and joyously returned to
the Metropolis. The next morning, when
I stopped at Carlock’s apartments to tell
him the good news, I found everything in
confusion. The place had been burglar-
ized the night before, and Carlock’s man
had found him insensible in the laboratory.
He had put him to bed, and a doctor found
that he was suffering from shock.

  He had been struck on the head with
some blunt implement.

  His wonderful vitality stood him in good
stead, and he quickly recovered. Later,
when I spoke to him of his great discovery,
I was astonished to learn that all recol-
lection of it had faded from his mind, and
strange to relate, he showed absolutely no
interest in it.

  The jar containing the Annihilator had
been carried off by the burglars, and it
was impossible to reproduce the compound.

  As Carlock’s biographer, it was up to
me to try and discover how and by whom
he had been robbed of his wonderful dis-

covery, and knowing the futility of pro-
ceeding alone, I tried to enlist Carlock’s
interest in the matter.

  “Watchem,” he said, “I may, as you
suggest, have discovered a compound which
possessed die remarkable properties you
claim, but as it has disappeared and all
recollection of it has faded from my mind,
why should I waste time to recover it?

  “ The chemical and scientific work in
which I indulge is performed with the one
end in view: bioadening my knowledge
and making my mind more acute for the
problems of my profession.

   “For instance, the Alcohol Annihilator,
as you term it, would be of absolutely no
assistance in helping me deduce the fact
that you are in the stock-market.”

   “ How in the world- do you know that ? ”
“ Very simple,” answered Carlock. “ The
elbow of the left sleeve of your coat is
worn shiny. That can indicate but one
thing; you have been using the telephone a
great deal. As your duties do not require
that you use the gabby-gab machine, we
must search for the cause of such activity.

   “Frequent calls on the telephone indi-
cate an anxious mind. Anxiety about any-
thing is due to the fact that there are ever-
changing conditions present. This condi-
tion we have in the stock-market. The
fact that you no longer keep posted on cur-
rent events, but can name the earnings,
dividends, and parboiled value of all rail-
road and industrial stocks, can indicate but
one thing. Furthermore, from the condi-
tion of your newspaper, which is covered
with pencil memoranda, any one can see
that you figure on margins.”

   “ As you can tell these things so easily,
Carlock,” I commented, “perhaps you can
name the stock I am carrying.”

   “ That,” replied Carlock, “ is a cinch.
You bought for a rise. Consequently, you
thought you would pick out a sure thing.
You are carrying 1 Compressed Yeast,
common.’”

   “ Carlock,” I commented, “ there is no
use trying to deceive you. If ‘ Compressed
Yeast ’ acts as it should I’ll buy an auto-
mobile.”

   I walked over to the ticker, which stood
in a corner of Carlock's office. Looking
at the tape, I was astounded. “ Com-
pressed Yeast” had just broken ten points.

   “ Carlock,” I gasped, “ for once you are
wrong in your deductions. I am not on
the stock-market.”
 Grit of the Eagle-Eye

BY ARNO DOSCH.

WHEN a railroader speaks of sand, he doesn't always mean the kind that
an engine carries in her dome back of the smoke-stack. There is another
kind of grit than that which the eagle-eye shoots under the wheels to
keep them from slipping, and many followers of the iron trail have a supply of it
that never gives out, no.matter how bad the rails or how steep the grade. The
men Mr. Dosch writes about didn't do any sliding. They stuck to what they,
considered their duty with the grip of sanded steel. Are they heroes? Read
about them and judge for yourself. At any rate, you’ll admit that their stories
are well worth repeating.

Joe Johnson’s Last Words.—A Pilot Pick-Up.—How a Train Crew That
Wouldn’t Quit Met Death in a Dynamite Wreck
in Pennsylvania.

that Joe Johnson had telegraphed in the
very face of death, and when the last letter
was clipped in half each shivered as if he
had felt the blow that had fallen.

  It was late, and the operator at Quakake,
the station next below, had leaned back to
read after turning Tom Beckert and the
late freight loose all the way to Ringtown.
When Johnson’s last word startled him in-
to a full realization of what was happening,
he jumped to his feet and ran out on the
platform. All he saw down the track were
the tail lights of the freight.

  With that gone there was no other help
for an hour. He returned to his instrument.
There was only one thing left to do, and
that was to catch the freight. He quickly
put his message on the wire:

  “ Operator Girard Manor catch freight
and send it back to Lofty to help Johnson.”
In the few minutes that followed every
operator on the division sat over the soul-
less, metallic companion of his solitude
and waited with limp lingers.

  A halting jumble of dots and dashes
finally broke the silence of the wire. It
came like the voice of a half-conscious man
and spelled out the words painfully.

295

being—”

  “ Hey, drop that key! Drop
it, I say!”

  The words snapped out like
pistol-shots and an extra
punch from the muzzle of the
revolver against Joe Johnson’s stomach ac-
centuated each one of them.

  “ Hands off, I tell you! I mean
business! ”

  In the desperado’s voice was that cutting
note men have who steel themselves to
murder. His fingers worked on the trig-
ger in a way that made Johnson wince, but
the operator only raised his hand, as if he
were warning a child to keep away.

  The action was cool and authoritative
and his assailant drew back instinctively.
It was but a moment, but it gave the opera-
tor time to finish his message.

  “—robbed.”

  Then the butt end of the revolver swung
down viciously over the back of his neck
and his body slumped across the desk in
the corner of the little depot at Lofty 011
die Philadelphia and Reading.

  In nearly every other station and in every
tower on the division the operators knew
296

THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.

  “ Robbers gone—jumped Beckert’s engine
—he doesn’t know what’s up—feeling bet-
ter—never mind me—catch robbers.”

  Girard Manor failed to answer all calls
for the next ten minutes and all knew the
operator was on the track with his lantern
waiting for Beckert.

  When the train stopped the two desper-
adoes were standing in the gangway talking
to the engineer like any other two men who
might have climbed aboard and made them-
selves at home. Their eyes were fixed on
him keenly, however, and as he caught sight
of the operator’s lantern, one of them quick-
ly asked: “What’s the matter?”

   “ Nothing,” replied Beckert, undisturbed.
“ Orders, that’s all.”

  “ Oh, that’s all right,” whispered the
other, as the speed slackened, “ I .guess he
does that at all stations.”

   The first robber was satisfied at the ex-
planation, but the suspicions of both were
immediately aroused when a paper flashed
to the cab window. Beckert, reaching
down, was even more surprised than they
when he looked into the excited face of the
operator who passed the flimsy to him with
the one word, “ Orders.”

         Reading the Warning. .

   Holding the paper close to the gage-lamp,
he scanned it carefully. He read:

   “ Be careful as you read this. Don’t look
surprised. You’re being closely watched.
You have aboard two desperadoes who al-
most killed operator at Lofty.”

  Four gimlet eyes peered over Beckert’s
shoulder, but he showed no signs of being
disturbed and as one of the robbers stepped
quickly toward him, he carelessly twirled
the message out of the window.

  The gimlet eyes turned sharply toward
the vanishing paper and a hand reached out
quickly as if to seize it.

  “ What was that ? ” asked the huskier of
the two, who afterward gave his name as
George Snyder.

  “ Order giving me a clear track.”

  His voice was dry and cracked and the
words rasped out suspiciously, but he de-
liberately turned his back on the robbers
and went about his business. It took nerve
to do it, but he did not dare let them see
his face. He could hear them whispering
even above the roar of the train and he
did not know at what minute he would re-
ceive a blow on the head.

  •

   They passed through Brandonville and
 Krebs without a stop and approached Ring-
 town. Beyond that point Beckert had no
 orders, and yet, if he stopped, he knew the
 robbers would escape, as they could easily
 overpower the operator and himself.

A Fight on the Foot-Plate.

   As the station hove into view he saw a
 lantern beside the track and made out the
 figure of the operator. He felt sure the
 orders were to go through, so he hardly
 slackened his speed. He leaned far out of
 the cab-window, and pulled himself back
 again holding a paper in his hand. This
 time he knew the robbers would be ready to
 read the message as soon as he opened it,
 but he managed to stoop forward and make
 out:

“Run for Catawissa. Sheriff waiting.”

   A rough jerk on the arm brought him to
 his feet and the outlaw named Snyder
 scowled down into his face.

   “ Give that to me,” he snarled, but Beck-
 ert swung around, and just as the revolver
 flashed in his face let the message drop
 from the window.

   “ Stop the train,” roared Snyder.

   Beckert glanced quickly to his fireman
 for help only to discover that he also was
 looking down the barrel of a revolver.
 Then, with that same dogged courage that
 prompted Joe Johnson, he put his hand to
 the throttle, and instead of obeying the ban-
 dit’s harsh order, flung it wide open.
 Knocking up Snyder’s arm. he hurled him
 off his feet to the floor and went down on
 top of him. As he sprawled across the other
 man’s body the second robber fell over
 them both, while into the pile leaped the
 fireman like a football player in a
 scrimmage.

Into the Trap.

   The revolvers fell out of reach, and while
 the struggle for them was still on the freight
 tore through Rerick's, Beaver Valley, and on
 to Mainville, within four miles of Cata-
 wissa, without a whistle to announce its
 passage. Each operator, catching a quick
 silhouette of the fight as the engine went
 tearing by, wired on ahead his version of
 how the combat stood. To them it was
 more thrilling than any story they had ever
 read and each report left them in greater
 suspense dian the one before.

At Catawissa, the sheriff and his depu-
GRIT OF THE EAGLE-EYE.

297

ties were strung out along the track ready
to make a flying leap for the train if
necessary.

  When less than a mile from the station
Beckert let Snyder slip from his hands.
The desperado reached for the throttle and
closed it, too wary by this time to chance
passing through another town.

  He did not know enough to use the air,
however, and the engine did not slacken
its speed until within a hundred yards of
the station. Snyder jumped. He stumbled
and rolled over and over, coming to a dead
stop only when the sheriff flung his weight
upon him. At the same moment two depu-
ties swung aboard and nailed his com-
panion.

Saving a Two-Year-Old.

   This is one of the stories they tell on the
Reading, and there are many others as
good, each with its accompaniment of ex-
citing details. When the gang in the round-
house begins to tell them off, you are free
to believe as much or as little as you please,
but for the story of Terrance Cummings,
two years old and an obstructer of traffic,
anj' one will vouch.

  It happened on a branch of the Jersey
Central in eastern Pennsylvania, but it is
hard for any one to keep the Reading
and the Jersey Central distinctly separated
except the auditors of the two companies.
The two lines switch back and forth into
each other so often, some of the men hardly
know which road is paying their wages.

  Cal Kimberley, however, was not wor-
rying about this or any other matter as he
came twisting down the upper Susquehanna
one day about six years ago with a light
passenger-train behind. As he rounded a
curve, he suddenly saw a little child sit-
ting on the track hardly three hundred feet
ahead. It was a down grade and Kimber-
ley knew he could not bring the train to a
stop before he struck the baby who sat
clapping his hands and playing as uncon-
cernedly as if he w-ere in his own back yard.

  A cold chill ran through Kimberley.
Throwing on the air quick as a flash, he
slipped out of the cab onto the running-
board and m?de his way forward to the
pilot. He did not know what he was go-
ing to do, but he had some wild notion of
leaping out as the speed slackened and seiz-
ing the child quickly in his arms.

Even before he reached the pilot, he knew

he would not be able to do this and keep
ahead of the engine. The train was not
slowing down quickly enough.

  Then to Cal Kimberley there came a sud-
den idea. One which added another daring
feat to the list of those which had already
been accomplished by nervy trainmen.

  Twisting one leg about the socket of the
signal flag, he swung down head first,
grasping the cow-catcher with one hand,
while with the other he reached down quick-
ly as the train was ab<3ut to pass over the
baby and lifted him out of danger.

  It was not all over, however. The train
was still moving and Kimberley, hardly
able to hold himseli up, encountered a diffi-
culty he had not anticipated. Mr. Ter-
rance Cummings, two years old, was wroth
at being disturbed.

  He had not asked to be moved, and to
be hoisted up in that unexpected manner
ruffled his feelings. He squirmed and
twisted and kicked until Kimberley thought
his arm would break.

  “Woo-ow,” screamed Terrance with an-
other well-aimed kick, and Kimberley, at
the very end of his endurance, suddenly felt
his foot slip. As he lurched forward, how-
ever, he gave a shove, flung Terrance into
the ditc^i and rolled over beside him.

The Dynamite Wreck.

  If you want to get them to talking on
the Jersey Central ask about the bad night
they gave the town of Ashley, Pennsylvania.

  Ashley is a quiet little village and never
got badly excited but once, but it hasn’t got
over that yet. You will hear the old-timer
there still saying:

  “ I was winding the kitchen clock. I
remember that because I carried that in-
fernal clock all over town with me the rest
of the night and didn’t know I had it.”

  “ What was it ? ” you ask, “ an earth-
quake ? ”

  On the Jersey Central that night has not
been forgotten, and plenty of the boys can
still tell you about John Rheig, who stuck
by his post and lost his life.

  Frank McLaughlin was the first to real-
ize what was coming. They had hardly
struck the grade below Mauch Chunk, when
he felt the slack in the cars and realized
that the brakes were not holding. It was
ten years ago, before the general use of
air, and there was none on his train. All
at once it struck McLaughlin what car he
298

was standing on, and jumping as if he
had set his bare feet on a red-hot stove, he
gingerly made his way forward, setting
brakes as he ran.

Riding with Death.

  “Sulfur and fire I don’t mind,” he said
to himself, “ but that way of going to
perdition is a little too sudden for me.”

  He dropped down on the tender and
made his way into the cab.

  “What you doing to us to-night, John?”
he asked the engineer.

  “We’re sliding, that’s all I know,” an-
swered Rheig] “ and we’ll never stop her
on this grade. Maybe we’ll pile up a car
or two in the yard at Ashley, but it won’t
do much harm.”

  “Won’t, eh?” Frank asked. “Do you
know what’s in that first box car there ? ”

  “ No. What ? ”

  “ Dynamite.”

  Then Rheig began to take a new interest
in the slack, and every time the couplings
pounded he held his breath. In a minute
Mike Bird, die rear brakeman, came run-
ning over the top with the same message, v
but McLaughlin, starting back over the
tops, waved him off.

  They ran for miles, couplings pounding
at every jump, and it seemed to Frank Mc-
Laughlin as if that dynamite car would
be shaken to pieces. Its brakes were the
worst of all, and he took the most of the
ride with the sound of the jolting boxes of
explosive right under his feet.

  Down the mountain they came, brakes
shrieking, whistles blowing, bells ringing,
and the dynamite banging around ready at
any instant to blow the whole train into
the next county. For a second time it got
to be too much for McLaughlin and he came
down over that latent volcano white as a
sheet.

“Listen to it rattling, John,” he cried.

“ Cut and run for it. We’re dead ones if
we stay.”

  “No, you don’t,” Rheig shouted in an-
swer. “ Just leave it to me. I’m getting on
to her curves and I’ll have her going like
a lamb before we hit Ashley. If they only
knew down there what we’re bringing them,
they’d give us the right of way straight in-
to Jersey City.”

  Though Rheig made light of the situa-
tion, he fully realized the danger he was
running. The grade dipped just below and

in a minute they were plunging down the
mountain harder than ever and he thought
he heard the dynamite boxes himself. Be-
low there was a short level stretch and then
Ashley.

  “ Get back over there and make for die
caboose,” he yelled into McLaughlin’s ear.
The brakeman started back, but not for the

caboose.

  He was no coward, and he decided he
could stick it out if Rheig could.

  The lights were out in Ashley, except
around the depot. Two engines were
slowly churning along the main line un-
conscious of the imminent catastrophe.
Rheig suspected their presence and tried
to give warning to the men in their cabs,
but the roaring death was on them all in
an instant.

What Ashley Saw.

  The rest of the story is Ashley’s. The
town was in its first sleep when Rheig,
still struggling to control the runaway train,
plunged through the yards and crashed into
the engines, knocking them both from the
track.

  Then came the explosion.

  Woof! Boom! Letters the size of this
page would not express what that ex-
plosion meant to Ashley. The jar that
followed shook the whole town out of bed
amid a rain of crashing glass as every win-
dow went to pieces. Even in Pittston, three
miles away, the people made for the street
in a panic.

  The air was still reverberating from the
shock when Ashley’s population began to
hit the street in whatever costume lay
nearest at hand, and as Rheig lay dying'
in his cab, the last thing he saw was this
motley crew of townspeople, streaking it
down the street as if their lives depended
on it.

  They fell to on the wreck just as they
were, many of them shoeless, some only
in their shirts, but they worked all night
as they were. Five engines had been blown
to pieces and everything else in range had
been knocked askew. They took Rheig to
the hospital, and found the bodies of Frank
McLaughlin and Mike Bird, who had stood
by the brakes to the end, although they
might have saved themselves by retreat-
ing to the caboose. In die morning die
rescuing party had to send for clothes to
wear home.

you for the road-bed,

 Honk says I am

  I forgot that you didn’t know about it.
I’m a bit unstrung yet. Like a fiddle after

do as we please, and
coughed up regular-

expenses.

We’ve run our lit-

"i'd WATCH THEM WHISK THE SACKS UP FROM THE DEPOT AND FOLLOW, MY
FACE ILLUMINED WITH HIGH HOPE."

What! All that traffic profit going into the
pockets of the unanointed? Hey-day and
tut-tut! It’s all right for the ordinary peo-
ple of this country to have a good time and
enjoy themselves, but money is not a matter
of sentiment; so the Transcontinental just
took a sponge and dabbed it on the map and
absorbed the P. and P., same as a book-
keeper removes a gob of ink from his ledger
with a new blotter.

  You know4 what happens when a railroad
company changes management. You don’t?
That fellow over there with the hunted look,
says he does. All right. They clean house',
don’t they? You bet me. And the old-
timers get theirs, don’t they? Some of them,
at least. They do.

  A snatch of poetry occurs to me when I
think about the affair:

   “ Ah, distinctly I remember, it was on a bleak
       December.”

  It was cool weather, even in Valhalla.
Honk, devoted soul, always alert and on

poetry now. I might as well do so before
I forget it:

  “ Each separate, dying ember wrought its
      ghost upon the floor.”

  I wasn’t seeing spooks particularly. I
was smoking an old Missouri meerschaum
pipe of tender memory, though a bit husky
as to throat and given to gutturals, and I
was reading a scientific treatise regarding
the startling adventures of one Reade and
a steam-horse.

  All unthoughtful, unsuspecting, and un-
prepared, I sat in my sock feet, poring over
my book, with the phonograph peering over
my shoulder and the little brass teakettle
purring on the stove. I was comfortable
and content. Hark! Our sounder clicks.
It is my call. I answer. It is well. I am
here. Horatius is at his post.

  Glibly come the fretful dots and dashes,
a rhythmic stream of crowding symbols. I
know that brass-pounder at the other end.
He thinks he’s a lightning-striker; but—

the job, had taken a party of capitalists on
a tour of the surrounding country—his and
my empire—in view of selling them a coun-
ty or two for the spring opening. I sat be-
fore our little cast-iron heater in the medi-
cine house and—I'll finish that snatch of
HONK AND HORACE.

Heavens! what’s this? It was gossip pure
and simple, but fraught with meaning.

  He said that the P. and P. was defunct.
We were dead and didn’t know it! At head-
quarters, everything was shot to pieces!
Rumors hissed and whined over the wires,
and dire, dismayful forebodings skulked in
the shadows! Everything was going to be
revolutionized, remodeled, renovated, and re-
constructed !

  Sweeping and drastic reforms'were to be
instituted! No more tobacco on duty! Save
the whittlings from lead-pencils and use old
envelopes for scratch-paper! Retrenchment
and economy, from John O’Groat’s to Land’s
End! A new regime, from cellar to garret!

  It didn’t take the seventh son of a sep-
temtet to foresee what would happen. I’ve
been present at some of these retrenchment
flurries before; so, in place of my rapt con-
templation of “ the ghosts of dying embers
on the floor,” I turned my attention to the
handwriting on the wall. And I’ll say this,
my suspense was not long drawn out.

  The morning motor brought a bulky
package — my package that fortune had
handed me. Fourteen mimeographed pages
of red tape, rococo, and 'raus mit 'em.

  Cut expenses and hedge was the watch-
word.

  Cultivate a light touch on the telegraph
instrument so’s not to wear off the varnish.

  Be sparing with stationery.

  Stationery cost money, and money was
scarce. All lead-pencil stubs were to be
turned in before new ones would be sup-
plied, and one typewriter ribbon was sup-
posed to last five years.

  These were among the general instruc-
tions, applicable to all. When it got down
to Valhalla specifically—ovv!

  Deeply as they must have regretted it,
Honk had been retained on the pay-roll.
In return for that favor he had been ap-
pointed a committee of one whose duties
would be to do all the work at Valhalla.
From porter "to passenger-agent, he was to
be the whole curdle.

  The medicine house would be returned
to the shops, repainted, refurbished, and re-
placed in the service where it belonged.
Then followed the incendiary list—the
names of those fired.

  It was lengthy and exhaustive. It cov-
ered the ground thoroughly, and lo! “ Ben
Adhem’s name led all the rest,” as a poet
who forgot to leave his address once said.

  I was "fired. The torpedo had been at-

tached to me and exploded. The can tied to
me proper. My time was enclosed. They
wished me well. If I starved to death, they
hoped I’d get off the Transcontinental prem-
ises first; not that they didn’t like me, but
they had other uses for the space.

  Of course, it made me sore. It makes
anybody sore to have this arson crime com-
mitted on their person. But I had quit
gnawing the woodwork and settled down to
a slow boil when Honk returned. He came
in, rubbing his hands and untroubled. His
boasted clairvoyant sense hadn’t hooked
him anything out of the charged air.

  It so happens occasionally. They said
Napoleon was caught cracking jokes on the
morning of Waterloo.

  “Well,” he said, “I nailed ’em. Four
fat rascals, with money and discernment,
signed up. They’re going to subdivide two
thousand acres of land into five and ten-
acre tracts, to be sold for five dollars down
and fifty cents a week. No interest, no
taxes, and water rights included in the pur-
chase price. First excursion second Tues-
day in March. What are you doing,
Horace? ”

   “ I’m packing up my little traps,” I said.
“ Me for the wildwood. I got my time this
morning.”

  “Wha-at!” he cried. “Show me! I’m
from Sedalia! What’d you do? Who
canned you? Ptt! Huh! I’ll let’em know
who’s boss around this dump! Where
is he? ”

  He peered out the window, scowling.

  “Keep your vest buttoned,” I advised
him, “ and glance over that. The P. and P.
has fallen into the hands of the Philip-
pines.”

  I pressed the documentary evidence into
his trembling clutch. He read the sheets
one by one, commenting betimes:

  “Thunder! Huh! Fire and pestilence!
The deuce—well, I’ll be—whoever heard
of such—huh? Aw, rats! Rotten! Curse
’em! A million maledictions on ’em! Lem-
me get to that wire”—the latter, as he fin-
ished and threw the sheets under the table.

  There was no half-heartedness about the
uproar he instigated, either. They were
gathering up broken insulators along the
right-of-way of the Transcontinental for a
week afterward, and they said they hadn’t
heard such sending at the headquarters of-
fice since the night Willie the Wizard had
the d. t’s. They thought lightning had
struck somewhere along the line.
'302	THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

  He got answers, too, right away. He got
an armload of ’em. The new management
told him the exact location of the switch
where he was to take the siding and pull
his fire. They cited him to a line of back
away back and muffle.

   They impressed it upon him that he didn’t
have a word to say, that he was known at
headquarters by a number preceded by two
ciphers, and that any say-so he might have
had formerly in the private powwows and
war conferences of the company had been

   I was still fired.

  Supper-time came and went unheeded.
Neither of us were hungry. We sat up the
rest of the night and talked it over. If the
new management of the road didn’t toss and
tumble on their downy couches, with burn-
ing ears, that night, on account of somebody
talking mean about ’em, it was through no
fault or oversight of ours. We read their
titles clear, and wished ’em bad luck to <i
finish.

  “ I don’t suppose, now, you’ve got any-
thing in view, have you?” Honk asked,
just as the dawn was breaking.

“Not just exactly,” I re-
turned. “ I guess I’ll drift

HODSE AWAY.

back East. Maybe I can get on the Postal
or the Western or a bucket-shop or some-
thing. I’ve a notion to try for a wireless
job on some steamer.”

“ I wouldn't be in any fidget.” said Honk.
“ Stick around here a while. I’ll make these
people come through as soon as their fever
dies down a little. I’d quit myself in the
morning if it wasn’t for Valhalla going to
the dogs just as we’ve got her on a firm
footing.” .

  I waited’till his explosion had spent it-
self and the blue haze had cleared.

  “ You’re right,” I said with fervor. “ I
agree with you. Man’s inhumanity to man
is the root of all evil, and birds of a feather
gather no moss; but I’m no guy to run after
’em and try to lick the mitt that soaked me.
I’m as independent as a hog on ice. I'll
see ’em in hoc sicysevipcr San Jacinto first!
I’d hate to think that was the only job there
is, anyhow! ”

  “ Ho-hum! ” sighed Honk.

  “ I’ll hang around here a day or two,” I
added. “At least, until I can get an an-

the most remote corner of the Sargasso Sea.

They mentioned that the goat industry
had been discouraged all along the line
lately, and hinted in so many words that
when any advice or suggestions as to run-
ning the road, emanating from Valhalla or
elsewhere, seemed imperative, they would
warn him a week or two in advance.

  They remembered things to say after they
had finished, and reopened the discussion.
It was some quarrel—lasted till nearly mid-
night. Honk came out of it in a cold sweat,
clear fizzled out, and all he’d accomplished
had been to exhaust himself.
HONK AND HORACE.

svver to some letters I’ll have to write. If I
didn't have to make my own living, I’d be
glad to "stay here forever and watch you
work, but I can’t do it consistently.”

  He was either too sad or too sleepy to
vouchsafe a fitting reply to this bon mot.

  That day I contributed materially to the
outgoing mail from Valhalla by launching
a couple of dozen missives. I also franked
about ninety-seven dollars’ (day rate) worth
of messages hither and yon. There seemed
to be little doing.

  One or two said they were sorry they
hadn’t known about me the week before;
there had been a hum-dinger of an opening
at So-and=So; etc. But it was filled
now, etc.

  I had one chance to sub. two weeks in a
broker’s office at some jerkwater village on
the Pumpkin Vine Route at the munificent
salary of thirty-five a month. I turned it
down arrogantly. Then I went to bed and
slept the clock around. A thousand bless-
ings on the man that first invented sleep!

  Honk tried to appear frolicsome and kit-
tenish when we foregathered at the festal
board that evening, but his quips were off
tone. Our old comrade, the phonograph,
fell off the table by some mischance, and
busted itself wide open most disastrously, so
that thereafter its chatter was stilled.

  The wintry wind yowled and mourned
around the coach, and the windows rat-
tled ; it wasn’t cold particularly, it didn’t
get very crimpy in Valhalla, but the wind
had a bleak whang to it.

  Honk mentioned several wild and inco-
herent things I might do to achieve fortune
and fame without leaving Valhalla, from
running a box-ball alley to organizing a
trust company.

  “Why don’t you start a nursery, Hor>-
ace ? ” he proposed. “ There’s a fine open-
ing here. Why, you could clean up a thou-
sand on sweet potato plants this spring. _Or
open up a pool hall. That would suit you
to a t-y-ty—•”

  That was the haphazard way his mind
was warping back and forth, like a bark-
entine with a broken rudder.

  “Why not open up a radium factory?”

I returned. “ I wouldn’t need to make but
a couple of pounds or so, and then I could
retire and buy North and Soutli America for
investments—”

  “ A mysterious and wonderfully fasci-
nating substance, Horace,” he commented
vigorously. “ You know the black sands

along the Pacific Coast are rich in pitch
blende—” and so on for an hour or two.
Honk was always set on a hair-trigger when
it came to a scientific discussion.

   Scientific discussions, poetry, grand opera,
and sociology are all right to while away
time with when you’re on your vacation up
in the Catskills or cruising in your yacht on
the dark blue Mediterranean, but When a
hearty eater like me is the next thing to
broke, in winter, and knows that nowhere
in the world is his name recorded on a pay-
roll, he is apt to lose interest in the topic
and fall to figuring, abstractedly, on how
long it is till the grass gets green again.

   “ I wonder if I could deadhead it as far
as Cleveland, on a pinch?” I said, inter-
rupting Honk in the middle of the com-
pound word, radio-activity. “ I’ve got a
brother-in-law there that runs a sausage
factory, and he’ll give me a job skinning
dogs any day I drop in on him.”

   Honk was too full for utterance.

   Within a couple of days I began to get
replies to my applications. It is surprising
how many different ways there are in the
English language by which you can turn a
man down and not hurt his feelings. The
most favored method, it seems, is placing
his application on file.

   I have applications on file in nearly every
city in Uncle Sam’s domain. Nearly all
of them are indorsed and annotated so that
I am to be given a shot at the first vacancy.
Some day I’ll be swamped with jobs when
seventy-five or a hundred positions mature
on the same day.

   The flood of mail quit coming after a few
days, but I continued to appear regularly
at the post-office. I’d watch them whisk
the sacks up from the depot and follow, my
face illumined with high hope.

   Afterward I’d return, drooping, saddened,
disconsolate. There was a certain corner
where I’d turn into the home-stretch to the
medicine house, and there my downcast
spirits would jevive and I’d look forward
brightly to die next mail again.

   One thing occurred during this dark and
gloomy chapter in our lives which I view
in retrospect most tenderly. My resources
had shrunk to one solitary, well-thumbed,
dog-eared ten-dollar bill, which I clung to
and refused to spend for even the necessaries
of life. It was the last of my summer’s
wage, and I cherished it.

   “ Loan me a small chew, old scout,” said
Honk to me one day.
304

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

   “ I haven't got a derned bit,” I confessed
for the first time in all history. “ I guess
I'll have to quit. I haven’t got no money
to buy any with just now.” Honk stifled
a sob or a chuckle or something, and turned
away without a word. Later that day I
found a whole brand-new dime slab in my
coat pocket, where he had surreptitiously
placed it. It was a thing most affecting.

  They took the medicine house away soon
afterward. We stood on the platform, shiv-
ering in the raw, wintry wind, and watched
its familiar lines fade away in the distance.
That was the mostest unkindest cut of all—
to go Shakespeare one better on superlatives.

   That night we slept on cots in the freight-
room. It was chilly and uncomfortable.
We both caught colds and rheumatism, also
neuralgia, catarrh, and influenza. We took
quinin and whisky for it—or them. I took
the quinin and Honk the whisky.

  “ I guess I’ll have to jimmy on my way,”
I said that morning. “The Transconti-
nental people don’t know- how to treat guests.
I’ll hit for Kansas City first, I reckon.”

  Honk begged me to stay on yet a little
while longer; he hated to see me go. He
said he’d stand good for my board and
lodging till spring at the Palazzo or any-
where else I’d select, but I told him I was
no moocher, and refused to be shaken.

  I might have secured a job clerking in
one of Valhalla’s enormous retail empori-
ums, maybe, but a railroad man don’t think
of things like that till it’s too late.

  It was a pathetic parting. I stood, with
all my earthly belongings in a suit-case,
and wrung Honk’s hand while the wind
whipped my legs with the tail of my last
winter’s overcoat.

  “ Write me a card every day till you get
settled,” he insisted. “ And if you need
five or ten or twenty-five, wire me. I’ll
borrow it somewhere for you. And good
luck, old boy, good luck!”

  “The same to you,” I snuffled—I had a
bad cold, you know'. .“ Remember the
Maine, and don't forget to take your medi-
cine regular. Turpentine and lard on a
flannel rag is good for sore throat,” I shout-
ed from the steps of the motor-car.

  He went ir.side the station and slammed
the door behind him.

  At Millardsville I had the good fortune
to strike Uncle George Jackson on Number
77. Uncle George would carry me to the
outer edge of eternity if every trainmaster in
the universe were aboard the same train.

    “ If I was you,” said Uncle George, after
 working his train and hearing my hard
 luck story, “if I was you, son, I’d hike for
 Fort Worth. They tell me it’s a coming
 metropolis. Booming. All kinds of work
 there, and pay you your own price.”

   “ I’d rather risk K. C. or Omaha,” I
 said, but Uncle George persisted in lauding
 the Texas village all the way. The last
 thing lie said, after he’d fixed it up for me
 with the con on the east end, was: “Good-
 by, son. Don’t forget Fort Worth.”

    Naturally, then, after a fruitless sojourn
 of a week in the river towns, during which
 I had spent my ten and pawned my suit-
 case, and hadn’t been able to connect with
 anything that had the remotest resemblance
 to a meal ticket, I turned my face toward
 " Uncle George’s Mecca.

    I dead-headed a hundred miles or so down
 the Frisco, struck a hostile crew, and went
 on my uppers. Me, that a few short months
 agone had snorted in the exuberance of my
 pride, a common Weary Waggles; hitting
 the rods and feeling within me the gnawing
 insistence of an impatient hunger.

    “What is it?” my faithful stomach kept
 asking. “Is your throat cut?”

    But for a few friendly station-agents, I
 would have gone into an early decline, so
 relentlessly does fortune rub it in when
 once she gets a good man going. And it
 was a long walk to Fort Worth, I began to
 believe.

    However, I never reached the place after
 all. One day, at the zenith of my degrada-
 tion and misery, I drilled into a homespun,
 catawampus sort of a hamlet far down in
 the Indian-infested hills of Oklahoma.

   The place was called something that
 sounded like Wakickewa. I’ve never been
 able to spell it without the official guide,
 and it isn’t worth troubling about anyhow;
 let it go Wakickewa. They said it was
 Cherokee or Blackfoot for “He dies hard,
 but we've got him.”

    It was a town of some twenty souls, a
 mule team, a sad-eyed cowr or two, and a
 drug-store where, for a dollar-fiftv, you
 could buy a bottle of “ bitters ” that would
 make you trumpet like an elephant. I'm
 not addicted to die bitters habit, but the
 incumbent of the railway station, one Arthur,
 Arturo, or Artie Birdsall, was.

    He was a lonely genius and almost crazed
 with the solitude of his vigil, so he wel-
 comed me right warmly, and I remained to
 divert him a while.
HONK AND HORACE.

  To be exact and adhere to the bare facts
without rhetorical adornment or fanciful
figures of speech, the guy was seeing blue-
eyed woggle - worms with yellow pompons
on their ears when I arrived, and they were
calling him from the despatcher’s office
with a clamorous insistence that sounded
urgent to me.

  I took the key with one hand and shooed
Arturo away with the other. He was argu-
ing with me at the time with the leg of his
office-chair. It seemed that they particu-
larly desired a wayward freight-train held
at Wakickewa for fear it couldn't pass the
up passenger some miles beyond on the
single track, which was all they happened
to have along there. And the freight in
question was then whistling for our out-
skirts.

  I manipulated the board, et cetera, and
everything went off without mishap.

  Young Birdsall recovered in a few days
and was profusely apologetic to the com-
pany, but they couldn’t see him for the
smoke, and the expected happened.

  To pad out a short story, and make a
serial of it, I got the Wakickewa station.
It paid forty-five per—a princely stipend to
me at that time. In fact, it was all clear
money except twelve dollars for board, as,

aside from bitters, there was nothing in the
village for which to spend money.

  As soon as I was comfortably ensconced
—there really wasn’t enough work on the
job to keep an insomniac awake—I sent a
hallo message to Honk, in Valhalla far
away.

  I expected a reply within the hour, but
none came. The day passed without word
from him.

  I wondered if he hadn’t gone from Val-
halla, maybe to become, like me, a wanderer
up and down the face of the earth, to die at
last ignobly and rest in the murky waters
of some darkling stream or in an unmarked
grave in the northwest corner of some back-
number cemetery.

  I conjured up all sorts of morbid con-
jectures about him, having nothing else to
do, while a couple of days worried by with-
out news of him, sick, dying, or dead.

  That Wakickewa place was a lively burg.
Phew! Very few trains bothered to stop
at all. All the freight consigned there since
the town began could have been loaded in
one twenty-four foot car; and nothing at all
had ever been shipped out.

  The southbound local slowed down and
came to a standstill one evening after I’d
been there ten days, and they began to dump

a line of trunks and packing-cases out of
the baggage-car. I wondered what travel-
ing salesman was so far gone as to alight
there by mistake, or if it was a show troupe
stranded and looking for a place from which
to start on a thousand-mile walk back to
New York.

  At that moment, a familiar form swung
from the smoker. It had a suit-case in each
hand and a smile from ear to ear.

  It was Honk, buoyant, breezy, and blithe-
some as ever! We fell into each other’s

arms.

  “ Howdy! ” he said.

Howdy! I came

as soon as I heard from you. How’s your
chewing holding out? This is a punko
place, ain’t it? But we don’t need to worry
about that, for I don’t think we’ll sojourn
here any great while.

  “ I've got a great business on foot. You
see, I brought my trunks along to save
time. This place looks malarial to me.
You're not so fat as you was, are you?”
“How’s Valhalla?” I asked.

  “Gone to the dogs,” he said. “I’ve quit
’em. The place will be gone back to bar-
barism inside of a year1—overrun with weeds
and wolves. We got away just in time.”

TRAVELING AIR-BRAKE SCHOOL.

THE Lehigh Valley Railroad has recently sent
out an air-brake instruction car in which an
expert is employed to coach its employees on the
subject of air-brakes and answer any_,questions
which they may put to him. It is intended that
this migratory school shall keep the men always
well informed on this phase of railroading opera-
tion. as the car will make periodical trips so that
they will have no excuse for getting rusty. The
instruction-car is fitted out with all the latest air-

brake equipment, both for cars and locomotives,
so that the instructor may give practical demon-
strations along with his talks. A general bulletin
conveys to the employees information as to the
time of the car’s arrival at points along the line.
If this does not result in an attendance sufficiently
large, special notifications are sent out. The in-
struction is for the men in both the transporta-
tion and shop departments, since at one time or
another they must deal with air-brakes.

IT HAD A SUIT-CASE IN EACH HAND
AND A SMILE FROM EAR TO EAR.
The Railroads’ Clearing-House
for Immigrants.

BY PETER MULLIGAN.

DID you ever try to give traveling directions to a man who could not under-
stand English and whose language you could not speak? If so. you
can readily imagine what it means to sell tickets and personally direct to
their destinations the hundreds of foreign immigrants who arrive in New York
harbor almost daily.

    This is the work the immigrant clearing-house has undertaken and which
it handles so well that few if any of the bewildered newcomers from abroad
ever manage to get lost, strayed, or stolen.

    Mr. Mulligan shows us how this organization, which operates with the
smoothness of a well-oiled machine, not only protects and guides the immi-
grants to their homes, but also carefully looks out for the interests of the rail-
roads themselves.

How Steerage Passengers of the Great European Liners Are Collected,
Tagged, Apportioned to the Railroads, and Made Ready
for the Immigrant Trains.

,IGHT hundred and fifty out of
every thousand immigrants that
formerly entered New York
harbor, stopped in the big
city at the gateway of the
new world and filtered
gradually over America. Within the past
few years, however, by the establishment
of what is known as the immigrant clear-
ing-house, the situation is reversed.

  Eight hundred out of every thousand
now never set foot in New York at all.
They are distributed by the railroads di-
rectly from the ocean steamers to every part
of the country.

  Each of the great deep-sea liners, after
its passengers have passed the health offi-
cers at Quarantine, docks and discharges
its immigrants into the Ellis Island boat
that comes alongside. Past the sky-scra-
pers of lower Manhattan, at which they
gaze with wide-eyed wonder and longing,

307

the newcomers are carried to the pinnacled
group of red brick buildings that from the
bay seem to fringe the Jersey shore.

  In, single file, with hands and heads
cumbered with bags and bundles, with
children sticking like burrs to their moth-
ers’ skirts, they soon find themselves stag-
gering up the narrow incline pouring into
the maw of Ellis Island, the vast regisistra-
tion-room where the morally, the physic-
ally, and the financially unfit are rejected.

The Eternal Question.

                           *

  “Where are you going?” is the question
put to each of them who has successfully
passed the swift and searching eyes of the
inspectors and clerks.

  Thereafter, until the immigrant has
reached his final destination—whether it
is Scranton or San Francisco—that is the
question he has to answer over and over
308

again. It begins when the clerks commence
to sort out the groups of thirty into which,
by law, the immigrants are divided on the
ship’s manifest.

  Those whose destination is New York,
and have fulfilled all the requirements,
'are allowed to pass without delay to the
ferry-boat. The remaining sixty or eighty
per cent, bound for other parts of the coun-
try, then become the railroads’ own, to
move quickly, kindly, comfortably, with
little or no friction, to their journeys’ ends.

  The machinery for this work has been
simplified until it is now able to handle
and carry away thousands of persons a day,
without confusion or delay, and at the
minimum cost to each railroad.

  Only yesterday a confused mass of alien
peoples went thronging into Manhattan,
unacquainted with customs and language,
the prey of all varieties of sharpers. To-
day a system sends each just where he
wants to go, expeditiously, pleasantly, with
his meager funds unimpaired; a separation
of individuals that under the old regula-
tion took many weeks and was accom-
panied by endless complications.

  Through long corridors and down flights
of stairs, with an inspector at every turn
to guide them, the immigrants pass. The
railroad department fills a large portion of
the lower floor of the huge station. It is
divided into two sections; one for the bag-
gage and the other for the immigrants
themselves.

Handling a Many-Tongued Host.

  Only fifteen per cent of these people,
railroad bound, and ten per cent of the
entire number of immigrants, are to make
their way to New England points. The
rest of them are to be transported to the
West and South, near and far.

  The transporting of these is the business
of the immigrant clearing-house. No more
ingenious combination of interests has ever
been planned. With the precision of an
army, the many-tongued hosts are moved
forward, their tickets examined, or tickets
provided for those who have steamship
orders, sorted into great cages of wire net-
ting, like immense aviaries, and then with
guides for each party, taken off on barges
for the great railway terminals.

  A clerical-force of not more than a doz-
en men transact all this railroad work for
the nine lines that comprise the immigrant

clearing-house. Ten to fifteen inspectors
and twenty to fifty baggage handlers, ac-
cording to the low’ or high tides of immi-
gration, make up the rest of the cohort.

  The railways that compose the immi-
grant clearing-house are with one exception
trunk lines leading westward. Whether a
man or a family is to be sent to Trenton,
New Jersey, or to Spokane, Washington, it
is all the same as a matter of detail.

  The nine lines are: the New York Cen-
tral and Hudson River Railroad, the West
Shore, the New York, Ontario and West-
ern, the Erie, the Delaware, Lackawanna
and Western, the Central Railroad of New
Jersey, the Lehigh Valley, the Pennsyl-
vania, and the Baltimore and Ohio, all
of which are members of the Trunk Line
Association.

Eager to Visit New York.

  It is at the door of the big railway
room that the question: “ Where are you
going ? ” asked of every immigrant, gains
its greatest* insistence. It is a broad door-
way, but no one passes through without
being questioned. Over its threshold files
an endless procession from all the nations
of the earth.

  One interesting circumstance is that no
small proportion of these people answer
this question with the only English words
they know: “New York.” Then follows
this dialogue, sometimes in Arabic or Fin-
nish, oftener in Italian, Yiddish, German,
Magyar, or the Lingua Franca of the
Mediterranean littoral:

  “ Show me your railroad ticket or steam-
ship order.

  “ This says you are going to Hurley,
Wisconsin. Across the room there. Give
it to the clerk there and he will give you a
ticket.”

  “But I want to go to New York.”

  “ Are you a citizen of the United States? ”
  “No. I want to go to New York.”

  “ You are ticketed for Hurley, Wiscon-
sin. You can't go to New York unless
you get an order from the chief clerk.”

  “ But I want to stop in New York and
see some friends.”

  “Jimmie,” to another railroad inspector,
“take this man up-stairs to the chief
clerk.”

  In a few minutes the immigrant is back
again. He has been unable to satisfy the
chief clerk that an exception should be
THE RAILROADS’ CLEARING-HOUSE FOR IMMIGRANTS. 309

made in his case, and that he should be
allowed to brave the dangers of New York
without some one being responsible for his
ultimate safe delivery to the railroad com-
pany.

   So far as possible it is the object of the
railway agent of the clearing-house to send
out all the passengers from each individual
ship over a single line, irrespective of the
route their tickets call for. Suppose immi-
grants from the Lucania, the Adriatic, and
the Kaiser Wilhelm all reached Ellis Island
the same day.

  The Lucania immigrants might go out
over the West Shore, the Adriatic’s over the
Pennsylvania, and the Kaiser Wilhelm’s
over the Erie. The object is to apportion
the immigrant traffic as equably as pos-
sible. On other days the other roads would
get their share one after the other, so that
by the end of the week or month each road
would have received the proportion of the
business to which it is entitled.	^

A Saving for the Railroads.

   It takes no little judgment for the clear-
ing-house agent to distribute these people
so that each road will be thoroughly satis-
fied, but the system has been so carefully
worked out tliat there is no difficulty. By
cooperation the railroads have brought the
cost of this service to a minimum, and in-
stead of each having to maintain a com-
plete equipment at Ellis Island the in-
dividual expense for each road is only about
$12.50 a day when the tide of immigra-
tion is not at its flood.

  The preferences of each immigrant is
carefully considered. If a man or family
have tickets to go west by the Pennsylvania
and the train-load from his ship is sched-
uled to tra\^l by the West Shore, he will
invariably be asked if he especially wishes
to go by the Pennsylvania, and if he de-
clares that he does that will end the., mat-
ter and he will be sent by that route with-
out the slightest effort being made to change
his desire.

  There is no hand about this rail-
road routing. The other day a swarthy
Magyar approached an inspector appeal-
ingly.

  He had been in the United States before
and spoke English. He explained that a

ship friend of his who was ticketed by the
Lehigh Valley wanted to go with him by the
D. L. and W. instead. Could it be ar-
ranged ?

   “ Certainly,” replied the inspector. “ You
can both go by the same line and by any
route you wish.” *

 Making Up an Immigrant Train.

  The object of all this system of ship-
ping simultaneously as many people as
possible by any one line is to enable that
road to make up its special immigrant
trains.

  An immigrant train is not generally sent
out with less than a hundred tickets. The
few immigrants whose travel preferences do
not coincide with the day’s schedule are
carried on the regular trains of the roads
they select.

  An immigrant train generally starts from \
its New Jersey terminal at~from six to
eight o’clock in the evening. It takes
practically all day to sort out the steamer
loads of passengers and to transfer their
heaps of baggage. The latter is quite a
complicated task, and there must be ac-
curacy and despatch to get the barges that
ply betweeen Ellis Island and the Jersey
shore loaded up at the proper time.

  From the railroad room where tickets
are sold and orders exchanged, the immi-
grant passes into the baggage-room to
identify his property, and thence into the
great room of wire cages, one for each
railroad terminal. These cages radiate
out from a common center like the spokes
of a wheel.

  Before the immigrant reaches his desig-
nated waiting place, the last before he
leaves Ellis Island, he is asked again and
again the olcl question, “Where are you
going?” and with the following, also new
to his ear:

 “ Are you hungry ? When did you eat last ?

Do you want to telegraph to any one? ”

  There is no insistence as to any of these
inquiries. The average immigrant, at just
this point, is so bewildered that he has
generally forgotten all about eating, and
may be faint from hunger, but not know
it unless he is reminded. Also the matter
of telegraphing may have quite slipped his
mind.

     This is the first of two articles on the handling of immigrants by the railroads. The second,
‘‘With the Immigrant Specials,” will appear in our April issue.

BY JOHN W. SAUNDERS.

The Thousand-and-One Nights’ Tales of the Early Days
Before the Railroads, When We Had to Fight Indians.

 CHAPTER V.

  Saving the Life of Boone.

OONESBOROUGH was one of
TgaMr those forts, or stations, erected
by the early settlers of Ken-
IwpBw/ tucky to protect themselves and
families from the incursions of
their savage foes, and was the
scene of many a thrilling and soul-stirring
incident.

  It was erected in April, 1775, by Daniel
Boone, and was located on the southern
bank of the Kentucky River. It was the
first fort built in that region, and its erec-
tion excited the fears of the Indians, who
were highly incensed at the rapid advance-
ment of the whites into their beautiful hunt-
ing grounds, which feeling was still further
increased by the British, who had forts
north of the Ohio, and offered them bribes
for every scalp or prisoner they took.

  Such being the incentives, Boonesborough
was besieged on^several occasions by the In-
dians in large parties, sometimes assisted
by their white allies.

  It.was the first birthday of American In-
dependence, July 4, 1777. The sun, which
was just peering above the eastern horizon,
gave token of a brilliant day. The birds
had laved themselves in the clear, cold rills,
and were commencing their matinal songs.

  The gate of the fort opened and two young
men came out. They made their way to the
adjoining fields to commence their daily
toil. They entertained no fear of imme-
diate danger from the proximity of Indians,
as it had been the practise to send scouts up
and down the river every week to look for
Indian “signs.”

Began in the February Railroad Man's

3io

  But a few days before the scouts had been
out. They scoured the country on both
sides, and no trail or other evidence of the
Indians had been seen. Hence these two
young men took no precaution against an
attack — not even taking their guns with
them.

  At that very moment a body of the-red-
skins was creeping silently and stealthily
through the underbrush of the adjacent
forest toward the fort.

  Totally unconscious of their peril, the
youths went on until they were within about
sixty yards of the Indians’ covert, when, as
they were about commencing their labor,
they were fired upon by at least a dozen
rifles.

  The whole scene passed under the eyes
of a young man who, for a few preceding
moments, had been leaning upon his rifle,
gazing listlessly after the two youths from
the gate of the fort, where he was awaiting
the laggard steps of two companions who
were to go out with him that morning on a
hunting excursion.

  In an instant how changed was his ap-
pearance! With body erect, his nostrils di-
lated like a war-horse in action, his hands
firmly grasping his faithful rifle, and with
his eves fixed on the spot where the smoke
was lazily rising in the morning air, he
stood, the personification of intense excite-
ment.

  The young men in the fields, who had
been uninjured by the first fire of the In-
dians, were now running for'life toward the
fort. Behind them followed a dozen
swarthy warriors, thirsting for their blood
and scalps

  They had nearly reached their goal when
a shot from the leading Indian, who had

paused to fire, brought down one of them
within seventy yards of the gate.

  Dropping his rifle, the savage sprang for-
ward with a shout of triumph, and pro-
ceeded leisurely to scalp the body. He had
presumed too much, however, on the distance
between himself and the fort, and paid the
penalty of his presumption.

  Springing his rifle to his shoulder with a
jerk, Simon Kenton—for he it was who had
been watching the scene from the gateway
—drew a bead upon the redskin, and he
tumbled over dead. Calling to his compan-
ions of the fort, who were gathering in num-
bers, he bounded forward in pursuit, re-
gardless of the superior numbers of the
enemy.

  The Indians, retreating gradually, drew
Kenton and his companions into dangerous
proximity to a large body of their fellows,
who were concealed in the thickness of the
adjacent woods.

  It must not be supposed that all this had
taken place without alarming the inmates
of the fort. When, however, Boone and
others called out by the_spund of the fire-
arms rushed to the gate, nothing was to be
seen or heard but the firing in the near-by
woods and the bodies of the young man
and Indian in the foreground.

  Ordering those around him to fellow,
Boone started for the scene of conflict, to
which he was directed by the increasing re-
ports of rifles.

  He found the Indians, as well as Kenton
and his companions, treed. The latter
might easily have been overwhelmed by
numbers, but this was not the object of the
savages.	v

  Kenton, observing a warrior aiming his
rifle at Boone’s party from behind a tree,
aimed, fired first, and killed the Indian
where he stood.

  Boone, turning to cheer on his men, dis-
covered that a body of the enemy had made
a reconnaissance between him and the fort,
and cut off his retreat.

  Quick as thought, he gave his orders,
“To the right about! Fire! Charge!”

  At them they went, one to ten. It was
fearful odds, and the whites suffered ac-
cordingly. Out of fourteen, seven were
wounded, among whom was Boone himself,
whose leg was broken by a ball from the
rifle of a stalwart warrior who rushed for-
ward to tomahawk him and secure the
scalp, a trophy which would have made him
a chief.

  He was not destined, however, to attain
the much-coveted honor. Kenton, who had
just rammed down his last ball, and who
was on the retreat, saw the danger of his
chief, met and averted it.

  There was not a second to lose; the sav-
age was already over him, and the next in-
stant would decide the fate of Kentucky’s
noblest captain.

  With the fury of an enraged tiger, and
with the seeming impetus of one of his own
bullets, he sprang forward. Not waiting
to bring his piece to the shoulder, he thrust
it full at the breast of the Indian and dis-
charged it.

  The force of the blow and the discharge
caused the savage to measure his length in
his tracks.

  Dropping his rifle, Kenton took his friend
and commander in his arms—and he was
no light load—and carried him in safety to
the fort.

  After the gates had been made fast and
everything was secure, Boone sent for Ken-
ton. and, taking him by the hand, said:
“ Well done, Simon! You have behaved
vourself like a man; indeed, you are a fine
fellow.”

  This, coming from Boone, who was nat-
urally taciturn and not much given to com-
pliment, was no faint praise. Kenton had
well earned it, however, for he had killed
three Indians with his own hands and saved
the life of his leader.

CHAPTER VI.

The Capture of Kenton.

COME months later, Kenton, who had re-
^ mained at Boone’s and Logan’s sta-
tions until idleness became irksome, deter-
mined to have another bout with the In-
dians. For this purpose he combined with
Alex Montgomery and George Clark to go
on a horse-stealing expedition.

  They reached old Chillicothe without
meeting with an)- adventure. There they
saw a drove of horses feeding in the rich
prairie, of which they secured seven, and
started on their return.

  On reaching the Ohio River, they found
it lashed into a perfect fury by a hurricane,
and the horses refused to cross.

  Here was an unlooked-for dilemma. It
was evening. They felt sure of being pur-
sued, and no time was to be lost. They
rode back to the hills, hobbled their ani-
312

mals, and then retraced their steps to see
if they were followed.

  The next day, the wind having sub-
sided. the}" caught their horses, and again
endeavored to cross the river, but with the
same result. The frightened horses would
not take to the water, and they were driven
to the alternative of parting with them.

  Selecting three of the best, they turned
the rest loose, and started for the falls of
the Ohio; but avarice whispering that they
might lead the others, they returned and
endeavored to retake them.

  This was by no means an easy task.
While busily -occupied in their endeavor,
they were surprised by a party of mounted
Indians, who had followed their trail. The
whites were separated. Kenton, hearing a
whoop in the direction of his comrades, dis-
mounted, and crept cautiously in the direc-
tion of the sound, to discover, if possible,
the force of the savages.

  Dragging himself forward on his hands
and knees, he came suddenly upon several
Indians who did not discover him at the
moment.

  Being surrounded, and considering the
boldest course the best, he took aim at the
foremost Indian, but his gun missed fire.

  He was immediately pursued. Taking
advantage of some fallen timber, he en-
deavored to elude his pursuers by dodging
them and hiding among the underbrush,
where their horses could not follow; but
they were too cunning for him, and, divi-
ding their forces, rode along on either side
of the timber.

   They began to “ beat it up ”; and as Ken-
ton was emerging at the farther end, he was
confronted by one of the savages, who threw
himself from his horse and rushed at Ken-
ton with a tomahawk.

  Kenton drew back his arm to defend him-
self with the butt of his gun. As he was
about to strike, another stalwart savage
seized him in his powerful grasp and pre-
vented the descending blow.

  Kenton was a prisoner. He yielded with
what grace he could command to superior
numbers. While they were binding him,
Alex Montgomery made his appearance
and fired at one of the Indians, but
missed his mark. He was immediately pur-
sued. In a few moments one of the In-
dians returned, shaking the bloody scalp of
his friend in Kenton’s face. Clark succeed-
ed in making his escape. Crossing the
river, he arrived in safety at Logan's station.

  That night the Indians encamped on the
banks of the river. In the morning they
prepared to return with their unfortunate
prisoner. Some little time elapsed ere they
succeeded in catching all their horses.

  At length, when they did succeed, they
determined to torment their captive in re-
turn for the trouble he had caused them.

  They selected the wildest and most rest-
ive horse of the number, and bound Kenton
to his back. A rope was first passed round
the under jaw of the horse, either end of
which was held by an Indian, and, even
with this advantage, it required the assist-
ance of others to control the vicious beast.

  Kenton was first seated on the animal's
back, with his face toward the tail and his
feet tied together under the horse. Another
rope confined his arms, and went round the
horse, drawing the prisoner down upon his
back. A third was secured around his neck,
and was fastened to the horse’s neck, and
thence extended longitudinally across his
body to the tail of the horse, where it was
secured.

  In this way he was securely fastened to
the frantic animal beyond the possibility of
escape. To be certain that he was secure,
the}- fastened another rope to his waist and
fastened it to the one which served as a
girth. Finally, they fastened a pair of moc-
casins on his hands to prevent him from de-
fending his face.

  During the time they were preparing him
for his ride, they taunted ■ him by asking
him if he wanted to steal more horses. They
danced around him, yelled and screamed,
and in every possible manner exhibited their
delight at the anticipated suffering of their
victim. With yells and “thunder shouts”
they turned the savage horse loose. He
bounded away in fright. He darted
through the woods, rearing and plunging,
and inflicting on his tortured rider count-
less wounds and blows as he dashed against
trees and rushed through the tangled brush.

  Kenton and the animal were lacerated
with thorns and briers. Finally, with wast-
ed strength and trembling limbs, the horse
returned to the spot from which he had
started.

  Kenton was suffering beyond description.
He longed for death to release him from his
torture. But the Indians were not yet sat-
isfied. They mounted other horses, and
drove the animal on which Kenton was
bound over a wide range of territory.

  When the time came that the infuriated

animal could move no more, and simply
dropped in its tracks, the trusty tomahawk
ended the white man’s misery.

CHAPTER VII.

The'Escape of Christopher Miller.

VJLT HEN General Wayne took command
of die expedition destined to act
against the Indians of the Northwest, he
was fully aware of the difficulties which
lay in his way, and the almost insurmount-
able obstacles to be overcome.

  The enemy against whom he had to con-
tend pursued a vastly different mode of war-
fare from that with whom he had recently
fought, and vigilance, subtlety, and cun-
ning were of far greater need in the com-
mander of such an expedition than the or-
thodox skill of a military chief.

  It was highly necessary to be constantly
upon the alert to prevent surprise. To guard
against the machinations of his crafty foe,
he organized several corps of spies com-
posed of some of the most efficient and ex-
perienced woodsmen and Indian hunters
which the frontiers afforded.

  The command of these companies was
given to officers distinguished for their in-
trepidity and coolness in danger. Among
others who merited and obtained this honor
was Captain William Wells, who had been
taken prisoner by the Indians while a child
and brought up under their tutelage.

  He had been engaged in the action with
St. Clair, and commanded a select body of
the enemy stationed opposite the artillery,
and did fearful execution among the men.

  Feeling assured, after that event, that the
whites would be revenged, and anticipating
their ultimate success in the contest, Cap-
tain Wells left the Indians and joined
Wayne’s army.

  His knowledge of the country, of the In-
dian language, and, above all, of their hab-
its and mode of fighting, made him a val-
uable scout.

  Among his men was one by the name of
Henry Miller, who likewise had served an
apprenticeship with the Indians, but had
escaped, leaving his younger brother, Chris-
topher—who refused to fly—in their hands.
Captain Wells’s men performed many deeds
of valor and bravery during the campaign,
which raised them high in the estimation of
the commander and excited against him the
implacable animosity of the Indians.

  On one occasion he was directed by Wayne
to bring in an Indian prisoner. Selecting a
few of his band, he started on his perilous
duty.

  Cautiously and secretly they entered the
Indian country, hoping to surprise a strag-
gling party, but met none. Searching care-
fully in the neighborhood, they came upon
a party of three Indians gathered about a
small fire, cooking venison.

   They had judiciously selected their camp,
having located it on the apex of a small
mound cleared of underbrush. It gave them
a free and uninterrupted view of the woods
around them, thus rendering it difficult to
approach without being discovered.

  Wells tried to make a clump of trees
near the base of the hill. It was a daring
move to make for it—but Wells determined
to make the attempt.

  Calling two officers—Miller and Mc-
Clellan—the three dismounted. Tying their
horses, they commenced to creep on all fours
in a zigzag direction, takiog advantage of
every inequality of ground, every shrub and
rock, to shelter and conceal their approach.

  In this manner, after much exertion, they
reached a fallen tree and for the time were
covered by its branches.

  Here they arranged their plans. One of
the Indians was on his hands and knees
blowing the fire; another was seated oppo-
site to him engaged in conversation with
the third, who was standing in front of the
fire. All appeared to be in the best spirits
in anticipation of their meal.

  It was arranged that Wells and Miller
were to shoot the two on either side of
the fire, while McClellan, who was as fleet
of foot as a deer, was to charge through the
smoke and capture the one in the center
ere he had time to recover from his first
surprise.

  Resting their rifles on the trunk of the
tree, they aimed at the hearts of their foes.
In a moment, two reports awoke the echoes
of the surrounding forest, and McClellan
was bounding at his utmost speed toward
the camp.

  Two of the red-skins fell dead, while the
third, discovering the rapid approach of
the intrepid .soldier, dropped his rifle and
fled toward the river. At the [joint where
he approached it the banks were twenty
feet in height.

   McClellan was at his heels, however, fol-
lowed by the others of the party. There
was no opportunity to double, and the In-

diari was forced to leap off into the water
below. He stuck fast in the mud, floun-
dering and trying to get out.

  McClellan, discovering his situation,
sprang upon him, threatening him with in-
stant death unless he surrendered.

  The rest of the party appearing on. the
bank above, the Indian found his escape
hopeless, and yielded himself a prisoner.
After considerable exertion Wells and Mil-
ler managed to drag McClellan and the In-
dian out of the mire.

  The Indian proved sulky, and refused to
speak. In washing the mud off him, they
discovered that he was a white man.

  The captive refused to utter a word.
Miller, thinking it might be his brother
whom he had left among the Indians, rode
up alongside him and called him by his
Indian name.

  The effect was instantaneous. The man
started, turned toward his brother and in
the Indian tongue eagerly demanded how
he came to know his name.

  Miller easily explained the mystery, and
the brothers were locked in each other’s
arms the next moment.	/

  The prisoner was Christopher Miller,
who, by one of those providential occur-
rences by which the white man seems to
be protected from danger, while the red
man is fated to extinction, had escaped in-
stant death at the hands of his own broth-
er. Had his situation in camp been dif-
ferent; had he been on either side of the
•fire, instead of in the center of the group,
his death would have been inevitable.

  After scalping the two dead Indians, the
party returned to headquarters with their
prisoner. He was ordered to the guard-
house by Wayng, who interrogated him in
regard to the intentions of the Indians. He
remained for some time sulky and reserved,
notwithstanding the efforts of Captain
Wells and his brother to induce him to
abandon the Indians and return to civilized
life. On being released unconditionally,
however, he agreed. Joining Wells’s com-
pany, he served faithfully during the rest
of the campaign.

CHAPTER VIII.
A Fist Fight in Old Kentuck.

TOE LOGSTON was one of that class
of “ half-horse, half-alligator Kentuck-
ians,” who could, to use his own words,

“out-run, out-hop, out-jump, throw down,
drag out. and whip any man in the country.

  Joe was a powerful fellow,-six feet three
in his stockings, and proportionately stout
and muscular, with a handsome good-na-
tured face and a fist like a Janney coupler.

  Fear he knew not. Fighting was his pas-
time, particularly if his scalp was the prize
for which he fought.

  On one occasion he was mounted on his
own favorite pony, which was leisurely pick-
ing its way along the trail, with its head
down. Joe was enjoying a feast of wild
grapes which he picked as he came along.

  Neither dreamed of danger until the
crack of two rifles on either side of the
path killed one and wounded the other.

  One ball struck Joe, grazing the skin
above his breast bone. The other pierced
his horse’s flank. In an instant, Joe was
on his feet, grasping his rifle—he had in-
stinctively seized it as he slipped to the
ground—and looking for his foe.

  He might easily have escaped by run-
ning, as the guns of the Indians were empty,
and they could not pretend to compete with
him in speed. But Joe was not one of that
sort. He boasted that he had never left
a battlefield without making his mark, and
he was not going to begin now.

  One of the savages sprang into the path
and made at him, but finding his opponent
prepared for him, he sought refuge in a
tree.

  Joe, knowing there were two of the
Indians, looked earnestly about him for
the other, and soon discovered him between
a couple of saplings engaged in reloading
his gun.

  The trees were scarcely large enough to
shield him. His back was partly exposed.
Joe, quick as thought, drew a bead, fired,
and struck him.

  Now that his rifle was empty, the big In-
dian who had first made his appearance
rushed forward, feeling sure of his prev,
and rejoicing in the anticipated possession
of Joe’s scalp.

  Joe was not going to lose the natural
covering of his head without a struggle. He
calmly awaited the savage, with his rifle
clubbed and his feet braced for a powerful
blow. Perceiving this, his foe halted ten
paces, and with all the vengeful force qf a
vigorous arm, threw his tomahawk full at
Joe’s face.

With the rapidity of lightning it whirled
through the air, but, Joe, equally as quick
VANISHING RAILROADERS.

in his movements, dodged it, suffering only
a slight cut on his left shoulder as it passed.

  Then he rushed in. The Indian darted
into the bushes, and successfully dodged
the blows made at his head by the now en-
raged hunter, who getting madder and mad-
der at the failure of his successive efforts,
gathered all his strength for a final blow.

  This the cunning savage dodged as be-
fore, and the rifle, which by this time had
become reduced to the simple barrel, struck
a tree and flew out of Joe’s hand into the
bushes ten feet away.

  The Indian sprang to his feet and con-
fronted Joe. Empty handed, they stood for a
moment measuring each thq other’s strength.

  It was but for a moment, for the blood
was flowing freely from the wound in Joe’s
breast. The other, thinking him more seri-
ously wounded than he really was, and
wishing to take advantage of his weakness,
closed with him, intending to throw him.

  He reckoned, however, without his host,
for in less time than it takes to tell it, he
found himself at full length on his back
with Joe on top.

  Slipping from under with the agility of
an eel, the Indian was soon free. They
were both on their feet again—and again
closed. This time the savage was more
wary, but the same result followed, and
he was again beneath his opponent.

  Having the advantage of Joe in being
naked to the waist and oiled from head to
foot, he could slip from the grasp of the
hunter and resume his feet with wonder-
ful alacrity. Six different times was he
thrown and as many times did he regain
his feet.

  Finally, their struggles and contortions
brought them to the open path, and Joe
concluded to change his tactics. He was
becoming weaker from loss of blood, while,
on the other hand, the savage seemed to lose
none of his strength from bis many falls.

  Closing again in a close hug, they fell
as before; but this time instead of endeavor-
ing to keep his antagonist down, Joe sprang
quickly to his feet, and as the Indian
came up he dealt him a blow with his
clenched fist between the eyes which felled
him. Then Joe threw himself with all his
might on the Indian’s body.

  This was repeated every time the In-
dian rose. It soon began to tell with fear-
ful effect upon his body as well as his face,
for Joe was no lightweight. At every suc-
ceding fall, the Indian came up weaker and

seeme'd disposed to retreat. This Joe de-
cidedly objected to, and dealt his blows
more rapidly, until the savage lay appar-
ently insensible at his feet.

  Falling upon him, Joe grasped the In-
dian’s throat with a grip like a vise, intend-
ing to strangle him. He soon found, how-
ever, that the savage was playing possum.
The Indian was up to something, the pur-
port of which Joe could not immediately
guess.

  Watching with the keen eye of a lynx,
Joe discovered that the Indian was trying
to disengage his knife which was in his
belt. The handle, however, was so short
that it slipped down beyond reach, and he
was working it up by pressing on the point.
Joe watched the movement with deep in-
terest, and when the Indian had worked it
up sufficiently for his purpose, Joe quickly
seized it.

  With one powerful blow' he drove it to
the hilt in the Indian’s heart.

  Springing to his feet, Joe now turned to
the other red-skin. He lay still, his back
broken by Joe’s ball. His gun was loaded
and he was trying to raise himself upright
to fire it, but every time he brought it to
his shoulder he would tumble forward and
again renew his struggle. Concluding that
he had had enough fighting and knowing
that the wounded Indian could not escape,
Joe returned to the fort.

  Although he presented an awful sight
when he reached there—his clothes being
torn nearly from his body, which was cov-
ered with blood and dirt from his head to
his feet—yet his story was scarcely believed
by many of his comrades. They thought
it one of Joe’s “big” stories.

  “ Go and satisfy yourselves,” he said.

  A party started for the battle-ground
where their suppositions were confirmed.
No Indians were to be found, and no evi-
dence of them except Joe’s dead horse in
the road. On looking carefully about, how-
ever, they discovered a trail which led
them a little distance into the bushes. There
they discovered the body of the big Indian
buried under the leaves by the side of a
stump. Following on, they found the corpse
of the second, with his own knife thrust in-
to his heart and his hand still grasping it,
to show that he came to his death by his
own hand.

  The knife with which Joe had killed the
big Indian they found after a long search,
thrust into the ground where it had been

forced by the heel of his wounded com-
panion. He must have suffered intense
agony while thus endeavoring to hide all
traces of the white man’s victory.

CHAPTER IX.

Defending the Wagon.

T> ETWEEN the Blue Ridge and the
Western range of the Alleghany
Mountains, in the northern part of the State
of Virginia, is located Shenandoah Coun-
ty. It derives its name from the beautiful
river, one branch of which flows through
its entire length, from south to north.

  Woodstock, a thriving town was settled
previous to the French and Indian War by
hardy German yeomanry from Pennsyl-
vania, who were tempted to leave the rug-
ged hills of the Keystone State, by the glow-
ing reports which had reached their ears
of the surprising fertility and surpassing
beauty of the valley of the Shenandoah.

  Gathering their household goods, they
reluctantly turned their backs on the homes
of their first choice, and took their way
through pathless forests to “the promised
land.”

  Arriving at their new home, they selected
Woodstock as the nucleus of the settlement,
and commenced with a will the laborious
task of-felling the forest and the erection
of their homes.

  A stockade fort_ was erected as a pro-
tection against the incursions of predatory
bands of Indians. A short time sufficed
to place these hardy settlers in circum-
stances which, if not actually flourishing,
were comparatively thrifty. They promised
so well that they were led to look forward
with hope and anticipation to a long-con-
tinued prosperity.

  They were a plain, frugal, industrious
people, unacquainted with luxuries and
only desiring the substantial requisites of
the simple life. These were furnished in
abundance by the fertile soil of the valley
in which they had taken up their abode.

  Among others who had been attracted to
the beautiful valley by the glowing ac-
counts of its fertility and comparative se-
curity, were two heads of families by the
names of Sheets and Taylor. The former
was of German parentage, the latter of
English birth, but having both married
American women, and being drawn to-
gether by that invisible bond of sympathy

which, in a new country, where danger is
a common heritage, unites with a stronger
tie than that of blood—they were more
like one family than two separate house-
holds.

  Being driven from their homes by the
massacre of two of their neighbors’ families,
they hastily collected a few necessaries, and
with their wives and children started in
search of a new home. Woodstock was the
nearest town, where there was a fort, and
toward that place they directed their wagons.

  The Taylor family consisted of himself,
wife, and three children; that of Sheets
numbered but three—himself, wife, and
one child. The few articles which the
limited room in the wagon and the hurried
nature of their departure allowed them to
remove, were a chest of drawers, a feather
bed, a brass kettle or two, some few culinary
articles, and the axes and rifles of tfye men.
These belongings, their horses, and a stout
wagon, were all they had saved, yet they
were happy that they were alive, and
trudged along satisfied if they could but
reach a haven of safety from the barbarities
which had been inflicted upon their less
fortunate neighbors.

  The greater portion of their way lay
through the forest, where every sound to
their affrighted ears gave token of an enemy
lurking in their path. The rustling of a
leaf, or the sighing wind, awoke their fears
and called up their latent courage.

  At length they had reached die brow of
the hill from which they had a view of the
beautiful valley were they hoped to find a
haven of rest. They paused for a moment
to admire the scene which opened before
them—to admire the natural glories of their
new home. As they spoke, the deadly rifle
of a concealed foe was leveled full at their
breasts. A savage red-skin, thirsting for
their blood, stood within a few feet of
them. Hidden by the thick underbrush
which grew by die side of the road, five
tawny warriors, painted and bedecked with
their war feathers, lay crouching like wild
beasts ready to spring on their prey!

  Just as they started to resume their way
and descend the hill toward the settlement,
the crack of two rifles and the whizzing of
two leaden messengers sent die two men to
their death! The aim had been sure, and
both Taylor and Sheets fell without <a
groan, pierced through the heart with the
fatal bullet of an unerring aim!

  Quick as the flash from a summer cloud

were all the fondly cherished hopes of the
wives and children—their safety and fu-
ture happiness blasted and stricken to earth
with the fall of the heads of their families.

  No cry was uttered by the bereaved wom-
en. Their feelings were too deep for utter-
ance, and there was no time for grief.

  They looked around for the foe and for
means of defense. Nothing was within
reach but the axes of their husbands. These
they seized and awaited the onset of the
savages. They had not long to wait. Push-
ing aside the foliage, five stalwart warriors
sprung, with a grunt of satisfaction, from
the thicket into the road, and made for the
wagon to secure their prisoners.

  The first to come up seized the son of
Mrs. Taylor and tried to drag him from
the wagon. The little fellow resisted man-
fully, looking up into his mother’s face as
if to implore protection at her hands.

  The appeal was not lost. Seizing the ax
with both hands and swinging it above her
head, she brought it down with all the venge-
ful force of her arm on the shoulder of the
Indian, inflicting a wound which sent him
off howling with pain.

  Turning to another she served him in a
similar manner, while Mrs. Sheets had sent
a third back to his lair with a severe blow
which severed his fingers.

  The other two Indians were wise enough
to keep outside the range of their blows, but
endeavored to intimidate them by their ter-
rific yells and brandished tomahawks.

  Nothing daunted, however, the brave,
heroic women maintained their theatening
attitude of defense, until wearied of their
endeavors and fearing the approach of re-
lief from the garrison of the fort, the two
unwounded Indians rushed into the thicket
for their rifles.

  It was their intention to end the conflict.
Taking advantage of this opportunity the
women started the horses. The red-skins
not daring to pursue them, they reached
the fort in safety. A corps was sent out to
bring in the dead and scalped bodies of
their husbands.

       CHAPTER X.
       Boyd Before Butler.

A FTER the fearful massacre in the val-
ley of Wyoming, the United States
government awoke to the necessity of stri-
king a blow which should teach the Indians

and their allies of those early times the
bloodthirsty tories, that it was strong to
punish such inhuman acts. An army of
five thousand men was assembled, in the
fall of 1779, to penetrate the Indians’ coun-
try in western New York and destroy the
nest of vipers at Niagara, which was the
headquarters from which the Indians drew
their supplies and received their rewards.

  The expedition was under command of
General Sullivan, and embraced, among
other corps, a part of Morgan’s riflemen.

  After a severe battle at Conevvawah—
now the,city of Elmira—Sullivan reached
Little Beardstown. There he encountered
a deep stream which required bridging be-
fore the army could cross.

  While waiting there, Lieutenant Boyd, of
the rifle corps, a young officer of great
promise, was sent across the river with
twenty-six men to reconnoiter.

  Piloted by a faithful Indian guide, Boyd
and his party reached the village, which
they found deserted, although it was evi-
dent that the Indians had recently been
there, for their fires were still burning.

  Night was approaching when Boyd had
completed his reconnaissance, and he con-
cluded to camp where he was.

  In the morning, at the first dawn, some
few of his men were on their feet. Ap-
proaching the village, they discovered two
Indians skulking about. One of these was
shot by a man named Murphy, a brave
fighter who feared no man even though he
endangered his own life.

  Suspecting that more Indians might be in
the neighborhood, and having performed
the duty assigned to him, Boyd commenced
to retrace his steps.

  He soon discovered that a large body of
the enemy, chiefly Indians, were lying in
ambush between him and the army. See-
ing that his case was a desperate one, and
having no other alternative, he determined
to cut his way through.

  Forming his men in a solid phalanx, and
cheering them lustily, he led them to the
attack. The first charge was unsuccessful.
Singular as it may seem, not a man of the
little party was killed, although they were
opposed by some five hundred savage war-
riors and tories.

  The second and third attacks were more
unfortunate, almost all of the party being
killed. Only two or three succeeded in get-
ting through. Boyd and a man named Par
ker were taken prisoners on the spot.
318

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

  As soon as Boyd found himself in the
hands of the bloodthirsty and revengeful
tories, he demanded an interview with
Brandt, the Indian leader, preferring to
throw himself upon Brandt’s well-known
clemency rather than trust to the generosity
or forbearance of his tory colleague.

  The chief, being near, presented himself.
Boyd, giving a secret-society sign and
grasping his hand with the grip of a
brother, claimed his protection.

  Brandt, belonging to the same society,
recognized both, and claimed the two pris-
oners as his own, promising and assuring
them that their lives should be spared.

  They would have been, had not Brandt
been called away from the camp on duties
of importance. Advantage was taken of his
absence by Colonel Butler to endeavor to
extort from the prisoners, under threat of
torture, information regarding General Sul-
livan’s army.

  In the council-house of the village there
assembled a remarkable group of men Be-
fore a table, on which were scattered maps,
papers, and writing materials, was seated a
short, fleshy, ill-favored man, whose head
indicated but few moral or intellectual fac-
ulties, and whose features were as expressive
as his head.

  He was cold and cruel. His dress was
the uniform of the Royal Greens, of which
regiment he was the colonel. This was
Colonel John Butler.

  Opposite to him sat an aide-de-camp, pre-
pared to commit to paper the statements of
the prisoner. In front of Butler, kneeling
upon one knee, was the light, active form
of Lieutenant Boyd. His white hunting-
shirt brought him out in bold relief from
the dusky forms of the savages, two of whom
held him in their grasp, while behind him
stood the stalwart form of Little Beard, the
most vindictive and cruel of the allies of
Great Britain.

  He was distinguished for a diabolical in-
vention for torturing a prisoner; and when-
ever this was on the program, he was mas-
ter of ceremonies.

  With one hand twined in the long hair of
Boyd’s head, he wielded a tomahawk in the
other.	'N,

  The tomahawk was raised to strike the
death-blow on the signal from Butler. Be-
hind him stood the other prisoner, Parker,
in the hands of a fourth savage. Several
warriors and soldiers completed the groGp.

(To be co

   Colonel Butler lost no time in interroga-
 ting the prisoner.

   “What is your name?”

   “ Boyd.”

   “Your rank?”

   “ Lieutenant.”

   “What corps?”

   “Morgan’s rifle corps.”

   “ What is the number of Sullivan's
 army ? ”

   “ I shall not answer the question.”

   “ Boyd, life is sweet, and you are yet a
 young man; there is no possibility of your
 escape, and you have only one alternative;
 either answer my question immediately or
 you must die.”

   “ Colonel Butler,” replied the intrepid
 soldier, “I am in your hands; do with me
 as you see fit. I know your power and your
 will to put me in the severest torture, but
 you cannot shake my determination to re-
 fuse to answer your questions.”

   “ Your death he upon your own head,
 then. Take him away.”

   Parker was questioned in like ftianner.
 With equal spirit he-refused to answer. He,
 too, was handed over to the tender mercies
 of the barbarous savages, who commenced
 at once their brutal and fearful orgies.

   Tying Boyd to a tree, after stripping him
 of his clothing, they formed a ring about
 him and commenced their infernal dance
 over a prisoner at the stake. Every means
 which artful cunning could invent or hate
 conceive was brought into play to intim-
 idate the courageous Boyd, but without
 effect.

   They pierced him with their knives;
 shook their tomahawks in his face; stuck
 sharp sticks into his flesh, and then threw
 their hatchets as near to his head and body
 as they could without killing him. Finding
 that their endeavors to frighten him were
 of -no effect, and fearing the return of
 Brandt, they finally cut a hole in his body
 and drove him around the tree until he
 dropped dead. He was then beheaded, and
 his liead stuck on a pole beneath a dog’s
 head, which ghastly trophy was left when
 they retired from the town.

   Parker, who had been compelled to wit-
 ness this scene in anticipation of a similar
 or worse fate, was simply beheaded, owing
 to their haste.

   His body and Boyd's were found and
 buried the next day by the army in passing
 through the town,

^OMEBODY dropped ;i set of false
  teeth on the long platform of
  the Kansas City Union Station,
  where you walk up and down
  while waiting for your train.

    Gateman Ralph Eldridge was
the first to spy the teeth, and he
gave them a little kick to the left. Detective
Bradley saw them next and gave them a
little kick to the right. Matron Evering-
ham saw them next. She daintily kicked
them forward. Mr. King, tourist-pilot for
the Missouri Pacific, saw them next, and he
gave them a swift kick aft.

  So there was that vicious set of false
teeth roaming at large in the.depot enclosure,
unrestrained and unmuzzled, a sinister thing
lurking in the path of the passers-by, a
horrible public menace.

  Now it came to pass that before the sta-
tion-porter overtook that set of -menacing
false teeth with his broom, it was encoun-
tered by an elderly man from Texas.

  Gateman Ralph Eldridge noticed the old
man, and suspected that he had escaped
from a sanatorium, for his right foot was
encased in a carpet-slipper of many colors,
the most conspicuous hues being green, blue,
yellow, violet, and crimson.

  Eldridge also noticed that the old man
hobbled, rather than walked, about the plat-
form.

  Then, all of a sudden, Eldridge’s ears
were assailed by a scream that meant mortal

Scriu began In June. 1910. Railroad Ma

agony. He turned around to behold the
carpet-slippered man sitting on the platform
with his knee up against his chin trying to
extract the false teeth from one of his slip-
pers.

   Eldridge rushed up to the sufferer just
in time to hear him make these few philo-
sophic remarks:

   “ What kind of a station management is
this, anyway? Hang the man who left his
false teeth here to bite a mouthful out of
my foot, and me with rheumatism and a
thousand miles to travel before I reach my
private physician in Texas! ”

   “ I'm sorry, sir,;’ said Eldridge, his voice
tremulous with sympathy for the excruci-
ating pain of which he was a witness.

  A crowd gathered. Depot Detective
Bradley came up and asked the old gentle-
man his name.

  “I’m Henry Wilson, of Texas! I mean
to employ a lawyer and bring suit against
this company for letting a set of false teeth
stick their fangs into this rheumatic foot of
mine! It’s criminal negligence! ”

   Matron Everingham ministered deftly to
the Texan. Then Pilot King of the Mop
piloted the poor bitten man to a bench, where
lie sat perfectly still till the Rock Island’s
Golden State Limited came along, picked
him up and hauled him out of Missouri.

   Two weeks later, Detective Bradley said
to Gateman Eldridge confidentially:

   “The legal department of the K. C. U.

n's Magazine. Single copies. <0 cent*.

S. Company is as
white as a sheet from

  “What’s the mat-
ter ? ” gasped El-
dridge.

  “And you, Ralph,
and me, and the ma-
tron, and the whole
bunch of us here are
to be summoned as
witnesses.”

  “ What ails you,

Bradley?” asked
Ralph.

  “ Remember that
gent from Texas that
got bit by that false
teeth ? Well, he’s
sued. He’s sued for
damages for crimi-
nal negligence on
the part of the sta-
tion employees in al-
lowing false teeth to
rove around here un-
leased and unaccom-
panied by owner.”

  Two months later,
meaning on or about
April *, 1910, I
passed through Kan-
sas City. I, too,
paced that long plat-
form while waiting
for the Golden State Limited. While I
paced, Ralph Eldridge opened his gate and
announced to all the world that a Frisco
train was about to depart for points in Ar-
kansas.

  I stood by Eldridge’s gate, watching him
as he punched holes in tickets. Nearly the
last man in Kansas City who seemed to
want that Frisco train was one who handed
Eldridge a ticket to Springdale.

  That man from Springdale looked as if
he were made up to play the part of an agri-
culturist in a drama entitled, “ In Truly
Rural Arkansas.” Instead of passing on
with his punched ticket, he stopped and
scrutinized Eldridge so minutely that the
gateman’s face crimsoned as he said:

   “ Don’t block the passage, please.”
Having finished his survey, the farmer
said:

  “Look hffre, boy, you’re altogether too
husky to be loafing around a railroad-sta-
tion. You ought to go to work. Tell you

  what I’ll do for you,
  boy. I’ll give you an
  order- for an ax, and
  you get it and come
  down to my farm and
  set to work cutting
  down trees on my
  woodland, and I
  promise that I'll pay
  you good wages.”

   As he spoke, the
 farmer placed his va-
 lise on the platform
 and seated himself.
 Then he took out a
 stub of a pencil and
 scribbled on a bit of
 paper.

   “ There, boy,” he
  said, handing the pa-
  per to Eldridge. “I’ll
  expect you.” Then
  he boarded the train.

   Eldridge read the
  scrawl. It was an
  order on a hardware
  dealer in St. Louis
  for one ax to be de-
  livered to bearer and
  Charged to Mr. So-
  and-So, Springdale,
  Arkansas.

  But Eldridge
 stuck to his job at the
 gate.

  Three o'clock on the day after Christmas
in Shelbyville, Missouri.

 James B. Smith was dead. The whole
town had turned out for the obsequies, for
James B. Smith had been the ablest politi-
cian and thriftiest farmer in all Shelby
County. All who knew him in life had
gathered to hear of the good that would live
after him__

  Just as the minister reached the point of
profoundest solemnity, the shrill whistle of
a locomotive pierced the air.

  Such an instantaneous pricking up of ears
on the part of the population had never be-
fore been known in that town. Never be-
fore had a locomotive-whistle been heard
within the limits of the seat of Shelby
County.

  The whistling was repeated with an after-
math of wheezing prolonged to the limit of
endurance. This second tooting set the
blood of the multitude a tingling. Inside
the church a general stir ensued. Outside,

a man on the edge of the crowd turned his
back on the overflow of mourners and started
off with an earnestness of countenance and
velocity of gait to see the machine capable
of producing that wondrous sound.

  That daring deserter from the obsequies
was followed by two more men. On the
track of the two came twenty. In the wake
of the twenty came forty-five and more.
The funeral party gradually dispersed until
all within and without the church had gone,
leaving only the minister and the pall-
bearers and the family of the departed.

  Those who thus left the bier of James
B. Smith did so in the belief that he would
have approved, for Mr. Smith had worked
overtime to procure a whistle - blast for
which Shelbyville had been waiting for
three-quarters of a century.

  Let us follow the multitude. Behold the
citizens now surging rank on rank upon the
monster that could whistle like a demon.

  What a monster it was! Many a time it
had awakened those who snored on Second
Avenue, New York City, as it marched on
stilts past innumerable cham-
bers comprising the cliff-
dwellings that flanked the
right-of-way of the Manhat-
tan Elevated Railroad.

  Shelbyville’s first locomo-
tive at length had arrived.

Cal Meldrum, the first loco-
motive engineer ever to enter
Shelbyville strictly on busi-
ness, leaned from his cab
window and shouted:

  “ It was a great run down
from Shelbina, friends.

  “ We covered the ten miles
in twenty-two minutes. You
yourselves built this railroad,
and should be proud of your
achievement.”

  It was a great moment for
Shelbyville, but it was only
a moment. There was soon to
come, however, a whole day of
festivities when the last spike
was to be driven and the first
passenger-train to be run over
the newly constructed line
from Shelbyville to Shelbina,
where the new railroad would
connect with the Chicago,

Burlington and Quincy, thus
bringing Shelbyville into the

  And this is how it all happened.

  On a summer’s clay in 1906 six men
came to Shelbyville. They were driving a
surrey, and they were large of girth and
istature. To the county court-house the
six men weije led, there to be seated on a
platform in full view of Shelbyville in
mass-meeting assembled. One of the six
strangers began to talk to the meeting.

  Those six men, be it known, were pro-
moters. They had come to Shelbyville,
to put before the citizens a proposition to
build a railroad that would forever lift
Shelbyville out of isolation.

  The six didn’t want a thing from Shel-
byville except free ground for station and
yards, free right-of-way through the whole
county, an advance of five thousand dollars
in coin for surveys, free water and light
for five years, exemption from town and
county taxation for ten years, an advance
of ten thousand dollars cash for prelimi-
nary construction; and the construction, by
the town itself and at the town’s expense,
of four stations, one roundhouse, and all

zone of the nation s activities!	‘'this is the weather for railroad wrecks, judge.

MRS. RFACH.
MUST TELL
YOU—GOOD
MORNING."

other adjuncts of a railroad in the way of
edifices.

  That’s about all the promoters wanted.

  Silence pervaded the hall of judgment
and mercy as the speaker sat down. Maybe
Shelbyville was stunned by his modesty.
Anyhow,' even the chairman of the mass-
meeting sat as if overtaken by petrifaction.

  Finally, however, a voice from a front
seat was heard. Every head turned to be-
hold James B. Smith, richest citizen and
ablest politician in Shelbyville.

  “Mr. Chairman and gentlemen,” Mr.
Smith said, “ I allow it’s the general opin-
ion of this meeting that since we are in-
formed that we ourselves must survey the
line, lay the grade and tracks, put up all
the buildings and bear all the cost of op-
erating the railroad for some five or ten
years—I allow, I repeat, that since this is
the case, as defined by the philanthropists
from Chicago, we might as well own the
railroad ourselves and operate it ourselves.
Pursuant to which, of course, I now pledge
the sum of ten thousand dollars to start a
fund for the construction of the railroad
without any help, advice, or interference
from any more promoters from Chicago.”

  The mass - meeting recovered from its
trance and greeted Mr. Smith’s words with
applause so vociferous that the court-

                    house ceiling almost
cracked-

   “ I pledge two thou-
sand !’’ shouted a
farmer at the rear of
the hall.

  “ And I five thou-
sand ! ” yelled the
leading hanker of
Shelbyville.

  “ And I will give
four thousand! ” cried
the proprietor of Shel-
byville’s department-
store.

Thus the pledges continued till more than
one hundred thousand dollars had been
promised right in the faces of the six pro-
moters.

That’s how Shelbyville raised the money
to build the Shelby County Railroad to run
between Shelbyville and Shelbina, a dis-
tance of ten miles.

A company was formed, contracts for the
work were awarded, and the citizens agreed
to give the company a bonus of ten thou-
sand dollars, provided the road was com-
pleted by January 1, 1908.

  The first locomotive arrived at Shelby-
ville on the day after Christmas, 1907,
though the road was not yet completed.
Only four days were left in which to com-
plete the road—and that bonus simply must
be earned.

  In every place where men were employed
work ceased. The men proceeded to the
right-of-way of the new Shelby County
Railroad. They dug and carted; they laid
ties and rails and ballast.

  That volunteer industrial army worked
like Trojans right up to midnight on the
last day of 1907. Then the amiy went to
bed. The Shelby Count}' Railroad was
ready to be opened to the public.

  On January 1, 1908, the last spike was
driven and speeches made by the president
and other officers.

   After the speeches, the first run was made,
the train consisting of the locomotive from
the New York elevated system, two real
passenger-coaches, some flat cars, coal cars,
and everything else that the teakettle could
haul at one time.

   Before that historical train started, James
B. Smith set a patriotic example by paying
five dollars for his ticket for the round trip
to Shelbina. Every man who could afford
it followed suit. Those who couldn't spare

five dollars paid one dollar, for everybody
wished to help the new railroad.

  As Cal Meldrum pulled the first train
into Shelbina he leaned from his cab win-
dow and shouted:

  “ Under the management of the Houck
boys we’ve got the littlest but the best rail-
road in Missouri.”

  And James B. Smith, who had started
the whole business, and had worked for the
Shelby County Railroad like a Jim Hill,
was at rest in the cemetery.

This Coach w'as a Target.

  Snow had fallen the night before. The
country around Trenton, Missouri, lay un-
der a blanket of white. In the afternoon
the weather turned cruelly cold. Neverthe-
less, Colonel William Carpenter and his
friend, the judge, went out for their usual
walk. As they crossed the Rock Island
tracks Colonel Carpenter said:

   “ This is the weather for railroad wrecks,
judge. Cold costs the railroads lots of
money every winter—from snake-rails.”

  The judge wanted to know what a snake-
rail might be, and the colonel answered:

   “ A rail split by the intense cold. There
she blows now,” he added.

  The California Special was whistling for
the station at Trenton.

  The two men trudged on through the snow
beside the track, and presently the Califor-
nia Special thundered by, and then—
Colonel Carpenter and the judge saw the
locomotive shoot up into the air, to plunge
into a snow-drift, while two of the Pull-
mans leaped to a position at right angles
with the track, and a passenger-coach top-
pled over.

  One agonized shriek—a woman’s voice.
Thei\.all-was still.

   “ Derailed,” the colonel said quite calm-
ly. “ Snake-rail,” he added, then bounded
toward the wreck, followed by the judge. A
number of Trentonites came on a run to-
ward the scene of the disaster.

  Flames were now rising from the over-
turned passenger-coach, out of the windows
of which men and women were climbing in
frantic haste.

  “That car is full of passengers, and
many of them will be burned to death un-
less we can extinguish the fire!” shouted
some one.

  “Where’ll we get the water?” said an-
other. “ Everything’s frozen.”

  “ There’s millions of gallons of water
right at our feet! ” cried Colonel Carpenter.
“ Everybody get to work! ”

  He hurled a snowball at the burning

coach.

  Instantly the crowd understood. Every
man began to snowball the coach.

  More and more citizens joined the “fire
department,” till fully a hundred men were
hurling snowballs. Thus the flames were
soon extinguished. All rushed to the coach
to join in rescuing those who had not yet
been able to scramble out. Not one passen-
ger had been seriously hurt by the flames.

  “ But,” said an old man—the last to be
helped out — “ if it hadn’t been for that
snowballing, many of us would have been
cremated alive.”

   The train conductor in his report said:

  “ One coach-load of passengers was saved
by ten thousand snowballs thrown by an
army of one hundred persons commanded by
Colonel William Carpenter. Many of his
soldiers are suffering worse than the pas-
sengers or crew in the wreck—from frozen
fingers, toes, feet, and ears.”

   It was the general opinion of the men and
officials of the Rock Island that so many
lives had never been saved by so novel a
scheme of rescue following a railroad
wreck.

  Colonel Carpenter’s valiant army stood
knee-deep in snow, with the mercury at
twelve degrees below zero. Many of his
men had hastened to the rescue without
overcoats or gloves or proper protection for
head and feet, and some of them lay 011 beds
of sickness for days afterward, suffering se-
verely as the result of exposure to the cold
and from frozen fingers and frozen toes.

  Two weeks after the “snake-railing” of
the California Special, Colonel Carpenter
received a letter from Division Superintend-
ent Easley, thanking him and his snowball
brigade, and adding:

   “ It is a pleasure to inform you that each
and every one-who so gallantly, without
thought of self or consequence, snowballed
the burning car, will receive due recognition
and substantial reward.”

   Colonel Carpenter, after showing this let-
ter to the judge and several members of his
army of snowballers, wrote an answer some-
thing like this:

  Dear Easley:

   You'll have to show us. We can't see that
   reward. We merely seen our duty and done it.

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

  A gang of graders were laying the road-
bed of the new Springfield and Southwest-
ern Railroad through Green County, toward
Springfield, Missouri. Early in April,
1907, the road-bed had been laid to within
a few hundred yards of a shack that stood
directly on the right-of-way as staked by
the engineers.

  The foreman of the graders hastened to
the shack and found it a combination house
and stable, the whole serving as the domicile
of one Daniel Hogan and Ms horses.

  Hogan had worked for many years as a
section-hand for the Missouri Pacific Rail-
road, but was now a horse-trader, living in
the shack as a squatter. He did not own the
land, consequently, the railroad people, hav-
ing obtained general consent to the right-of-
way through the county, had not deemed
it necessary to “ approach ” Hogan person-
ally on the subject of tearing down his
shack.

  “Dan Hogan,” said the grade foreman,
“ you must move out of here. My men will
reach this spot in a day or two—and the
line runs right through this shanty.”

  “ Go long with you,” replied Hogan as
he lighted his pipe. “ Sure, haven’t I lived
here for fourteen years? Me home’s me
own, and I’ll wallop the first man that
touches stick or timber of it. Maybe I’ll
put you in law, too, mind? I do be full
acquainted with the law.”

  Two days later, when the grade reached
the hut, Hogan stood in his doorway, bel-
ligerent, hostile, pugnacious. Rolling up
his sleeves, he cried:

   “ One at a time now, yous! I’ll fight any
wan of yous that trespasses on me home! ”
The foreman argued and protested and
even demanded that Hogan abandon the hut
peacefully; but the irate son of Erin talked
so much about going to law that he suc-
ceeded in frightening the foreman into the
belief that possibly any attempt to dislodge
the squatter by force might plunge the rail-
road company into legal complications.

  The upshot of the matter was that the
foreman ordered his men to build the road-
bed right up to the south wall of the hut;
to leave the hut alone, and then to resume
work northward from the north wall.

  A month later along came the track-lay-
ers, and a new foreman met the enemy in
the person of the obstinate Hogan

   “ We’re going to pull this building down,
Hogan,” announced the foreman.

   “ It’s mighty confidint yez are,” answered

the old section-hand. “Lay hand on me
home, and I’ll make it so hot for your com-
pany in the coorts that you’ll be losing your
job for trespassin’ illegal. Sure I'm an in-
tilligent man, and I know me rights.”

  The foreman of track-layers could not
adopt the course that had been pursued by
the graders, namely, to build up to the
south wall of the shack and then resume
work northward from the north wall.

  Therefore, the foreman of track-layers
now hurried down the line to where the rail-
road construction engineer, a young man
named Edgar Morrison, was inspecting the
work.

  Morrison, after listening to the foreman’s
story of the predicament with respect to Dan
Hogan’s hut, said thoughtfully:

  “ You say that Hogan keeps repeating the
statement that he is a man of intelligence?
Yes? Well, then, that’s his weak spot. No
argument will avail with him except one that
touches his vanity in respect to what he con-
ceives to be his intellect. I think I see a
way to get rid of Hogan without a hand-to-
hand fight and without bringing the affair
into court.”

  A few hours later young Morrison
sauntered up to Dan Hogan’s shack, en-
tered, and said politely:

  “ Pardon my intrusion. Is this Mr. Dan-
iel Hogan ? ”

  “ That’s me name,” answered the horse-
trader. “ And sure I know you, Mr. Morri-
son. You’re the boss over all the ignorant
foremen on this railroad work.”

  “Yes, Mr. Hogan. I’ve come to have a
little talk about this home of yours, because
I know you to be a man of intelligence—I
may say large intelligence.”

  “ Aye! ” assented Hogan, throwing out his
chest.

  “Well, then, Mr. Hogan, as the ambas-
sador of the railroad company, and as czar
to this, your castle, it is my duty to remind
you of an important matter of which you
doubtless already possess full knowledge,
but which you seem to have overlooked in
your very able debates with our foremen.
I hardly need say to a man of your intel-
ligence that I refer to the right of eminent
domain.”

  “Hey? What’s that?” cried Hogan,
growing red in the face. “Yis, yis! I
understand. Now, d'ye know, I had clean
forgotten all about her. ’Tis true. I've
heard say she do be the owner of this land.”
“ It’s a pleasure to converse with an in-
TEN THOUSAND MILES BY RAIL.

telligent man like you, my dear Mr. Ho-
gan,” said the young engineer. “ You will
permit me now to mention a fact—of which
you are cognizant, of course—relating to
the right of eminent domain as applied to
railroads when acquiring property in this
State for purposes of
right-of-way.

   “ The Supreme Court
of Missouri, as you al-
ready well know, has re-
cently handed down a
decision that the right
of eminent domain, as
applied to a railroad ac-
quiring a right - of - way,
does, by reasonable con-
struction, include the right
to exercise the said power
of eminent domain for the
acquisition of any of the
necessary adjuncts of such
road.”

   “ Aye! ” put in Hogan.

“ The lady knew her
rights, and, of coorse, the
Suprame Coort backed her
up. I do not dispute
that, Mister Morrison.”

   “ Therefore, my dear
Mr. Hogan,” continued
the engineer, “ that right
as applied specifically to
this castle of yours, gives
the railroad the power to
condemn, raze, destroy,
and obliterate this house
and stable forthwith with-
out further notice, all, of
course, in the lawful exer-
cise of the right of emi-
nent domain. You quite
thoroughly under-
stand the situation, my dear Mr. Hogan?
Of course you do. You understand that any
further obstinacy on your part would be a
distinct reflection on your intelligence.”

   “ Well, now, Mister Morrison,” the squat-
 ter replied, “since you put it that way, I
 may as well inform you that sich was me
 own opinion. Tell the lady that Til be
 movin’ this night over to the house of Jim
 O’Riley, whose wife do be takin’ in boord-
 ers, of which, be to-morrow marnin’, I’ll
 /be wan.”

   Morrison sauntered away, his grave face
 betraying none of his inward amusement.
 He had not gone far, however, when he

wheeled round and returned to the hut to

say:

  “ Pardon me, Mr. Hogan. My own lim-
ited intelligence leaves me in a quandary.
I am in some doubt as to the particular lady
to whom you refer—the one to whom you

wish me to convey your courteous message.”
“The lady!” exclaimed Dan Hogan.
“ Sure, who should I mean but the lady who
do be provin’ to me her right to exercise
her power over this property and all neces-
sary adjuncts thereof. I mean the lady
who owns this land—Emmy Domain.”

The Conductor Fan.

   At every Rock Island Railroad station in
Missouri, Conductor Jim Reach was known
as a baseball enthusiast. In St. Louis,
where lie lived, he was famous among the
railroad boys as the hottest fan of them all.

"i'll kill any one that trespasses on me home!"
326

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

  Even while he was terminal yardmaster
at St. Louis, he frequently contrived, some-
how, to get away from his post long enough
to see the last half of the big games.

  When he became a conductor and got a
day run, he still managed to attend the most
important games, but grieved deeply be-
cause he missed seeing the lesser twirlers
and sluggers at work. For ten years he
divided his time between conducting Rock
Island trains and fanning at the baseball
parks.

  One evening Jim Reach returned to his
home on Spring Avenue and said to his
wife:

  “Mollie, I’m transferred to a night run.”

  “ Then you yourself asked for the trans-
fer, Jim, dear, now, didn’t you?” Mrs..
Reach replied.

  “ Yes.”

  “ Please change back to the day run,
Jim. If you take the night run you’ll
spend all your afternoons watching base-
ball games. That’s why you changed,
isn’t it?”

  “ Yes.”

  “Jim, dear, you’re a Mason, you’re an
Elk, you’re a member of the Missouri Ath-
letic Club—and all these societies, together
with your baseballing, take you away from
home too much. Think of our children.
They want to see their father once in a
while. Please, Jim, dear, don’t take the
night run.”

  “ I’ve asked for and received the trans-
fer, Mollie. What’s done is done. But I
will cut out the lodges, and leave the house
only on the days when the big fellows
pitch.”

  Six months passed. All that time Jim
Reach conducted No. 28—the St. Louis-
Colorado Express—by night and fanned
by day.

  One night when Jim Reach arrived at the
Union Station, St. Louis, to take his train
out, he had a little heart-to-heart talk with
his engineer and fireman, Will Cowan and
Hv Ryan.

  “ Boys,” said Reach, “ this run to-night
will be my last with you. I’m going back
to a day run.”

  “ What! ” exclaimed Cowan. “ Why,
the baseball season is just beginning. How
will you get off to attend the games ? ”

  “I’ve got to quit the night work, Cowan.
My wife, ever since I took the night run,
has been at me to go back to daylight
railroading.”

  The next morning, Mrs. Jim Reach
helped her three children .to dress, then
went down to get breakfast. She sang
blithely while she fried the bacon and eggs
and mixed the pancakes. That morning
Jim Reach would come in from the very
last of his niglit runs.

  Some one rang the front door-bell. Who
could the caller be at that early hour?

  Mrs. Reach took off her apron and
opened the front door — to find that her
caller was Engineer Boyer, of the Rock
Island, an intimate friend of her husband.

  “Why, Mr. Bover. Glad to see you.
Where’s Jim?”

  “ Coming, Mrs. Reach. Yes, he’s on the
way here.”

  Boyer was taken into the best room.
After looking around and playing nervous-
ly with his cap, he said:

  “Where’re the children?”

  “In the kitchen. Why?”

  “ Oh, nothing particular, Mrs. Reach.
Jim will be‘playing with them evenings—
now that he’s gone back to a day run, won’t
he? But, Mrs. Reach, I've come to tell you
that—well, that—oh, yes—that Jim and
me were having a long talk last night on
Jim’s pet subject.

  “ ‘ Boyer,’ he says to me, ‘ a good eye
and the ability to time your swing ain’t all
there is to the art of batting. No, sir. You
must also know how to outguess the pitcher.
You must know the twirlers twirls as well
as he knows ’em himself.’

  “ Yes, Mrs. Reach,” Boyer went on, “ Jim
Reach certainly knew—knows—all about
pills and sluggers. Says he to me:

      Boyer,’ he says, 1 strength is not really
necessary in a slugger. No, sir. You just
meet the pill squarely with a snap swing
and it will travel just as far as if you
put all your heft behind it.’

  “Well, Mrs. Reach,” concluded Boyer,
“I’ll be bidding you good morning. Oh,
by the way, Mrs. Reach, I came to tell you
—well, now, Mrs. Reach, did you ever hear
Jim speak of a wooden trestle that’s on our
run over at Union, Missouri?”

 “No. Why?”

  “Well, Mrs. Reach, I must tell you—
good morning.”

  Without another word, Boyer opened the
door, stepped out, and closed it behind him,
leaving Mrs. Reach standing in the middle
of the floor in dumb amazement.

  “ Well! ” she exclaimed. “ Whatever
made Sam Boyer call on me at seven o’clock
TEN THOUSAND MILES BY RAIL.

" CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I VE JUST RUINED MY WHITE DRESS ? "

in the morning just to tell me that nonsense
about baseball and a trestle at Union, Mis-
souri? He certainly acted queer, anyhow.”
Meantime, Boyer went down to the Union
Station and met his fireman, Sid Gold-
thwaite.

  “Did you tell her?” asked Goldthwaite
in an awed voice.

  “No,” replied Boyer. “I just couldn’t.
You go up there and tell her yourself. Do
it for me, Sid, like a good fellow.”

  “Sure I will,” said the fireman. “Some
one’s got to do it.”

  An hour later, Goldthwaite called at Boy-
er's home.

  “ Did you tell her,” asked Boyer in a
hoarse whisper.

  “No,” answered the fireman. “I just
couldn’t. Beside, I didn’t need to. Jim
Reach's body had already been carried in-
to the best room and the undertaker was
on the job. Well, Boyer, that wreck of
28 last night was a bad one, wasn’t it?
Bill Cowan tells me that when he saw his
cars dropping through that trestle, he
thought sure that everybody present was
about to cash in.”

  “And to think,” answered Boyer, “that
not another darned person aboard of that
train was killed except Jim.”

  Tim Murphy was a huge-hearted engi-
neer, and mighty was he in sympathy. Tim
Murphy was on the head-end of the Den-
ver Flier of the St. Louis, Keokuk and
Northwestern Railway, running over the
Chicago and Alton tracks. On this par-
ticular run he was approaching the trestle
near Louisiana, Missouri. He cried to his
fireman:

  “Great Caisar! There’s Hen Baird and
his whole family in the middle of the
trestle! ”

  Murphy put on the emergency. The
Denver Flier gave a series of jolts and jars,
which the passengers did not forget for
weeks afterward.

  “ They’re done for—the whole Baird
family!” yelled Murphy. “I can’t stop
in time! ”

  The Flier rushed on the trestle toward
the four persons in the middle of it—a
man, a woman, and two young girls.

  That trestle was eighty feet long, thirty
feet high, and a single tracker. On neither
side of the track was there room for the
pedestrians to stand aside for the train
to pass. Either they must jump to death
on the rocks protruding from the shallow
stream thirty feet below, or they must re-
main on the structure to be killed.
328

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

  “ Good-by, Hen! ” shouted Murphy, be-
lieving that his train was about to wipe out
the Baird family.

  Even as he said good-by, the tears in
his eyes, the four persons threw themselves
flat on the ties on the outer edges of the
trestle.

  The train dashed by them and came to
a stop. With tears now streaming down
his face. Engineer Murphy climbed out of
the cab.

  “ Hen Baird and his whole family—gone,
gone! ” he wailed.

  He ran back, expecting to find that the
mangled bodies had been hurled from the
trestle and that he would see them float-
ing down-stream. But not a sign of a body
could Murphy see.

  The train conductor joined him and
Murphy, trying to force back the tears that
simply would well up out of his soul,
sobbed:

  “And to think this should happen to
me! To think that it should be left to
me, Tim Murphy, to wipe out Hen Baird’s
family! ”

  “Don’t cry, Murphy, old boy,” said the
conductor, soothingly. “ The Baird family
is in good health, though maybe a little
uncomfortable just at present.”

  “ What do you mean ? ” asked Murphy,
brightening up and wiping away the tears.

  “ I mean, that the four of them are ly-
ing flat on the ties under the train. They
were taking a Sunday afternoon walk—and
got caught here, as you see. But they’re a
family with presence of mind. So they just
lay down and let you run over ’em. They’re
not hurt a bit—only inconvenienced. Back
the train slowly now, Murphy, so they
can get up and walk off the trestle.”

  Murphy climbed into his cab—and backed
the train very slowly until four figures
uprose in front of the engine.

  Murphy stopped the train and said to
the Bairds:

  “It was a close call, Hen.” Murphy
could not keep back the tears.

  “What you bellerin’ about, Murphy?”

asked Baird, viewing the engineer’s tears
in amazement.

  “ I can’t help it, Hen. There are two
kinds of tears, you see. One’s for funerals
and the other’s for resurrections. I’ve shed
both in the last five minutes. And you,
Miss Kate,” turning to the eldest daughter:
“W'eren’t you just scared stiff?”

  “Not at all, Mr. Murphy, thanks. I’m
mad, that’s all.”

  “Mad?-” What about?”

  “ Can’t you see, Mr. Murphy, that I’ve
just ruined my white dress? It had just
been laundered! Isn’t it a shame!”

  “ So sorry about your dress, miss. But
now, if you four will kindly continue your
afternoon walk and glide off this trestle
the train will then be able to resume
business.”

  Murphy climbed once more into the cab;
a tear again stole down his face.

  “What are you weeping about now?”
asked the fireman.

  “ There’s three kinds of tears, boy,” an-
swered Murphy. “ I’ve already shed two
kinds. This particular kind I’m shedding
now represents sympathy for folks who find
it necessarv to bluff this game called life.”
“Bluff? What’s that?”

  “ I mean sympathy for families that
bluff, get called, and lose out.”

  “No savvy. Show me.”

  “ Don’t you see, you tallow-pot, that these
four Bairds were bluffing? They pretended
to be all right. Bet you a gold double-
eagle to a tin dime that by the time they
get home they’ll all four of ’em go to pieces
and call in a doctor.”

  The next day, when Tim Murphy stop-
ped his train at Louisiana, he said to the
station-agent:

  “How are the Bairds to-day?”

  “Their house is turned into a hospital,
Mr. Murphy. They’re all down and out.”
“With nervous prostration?” Murphy
asked.'

  “ Yes.”

  “ Old tallow-pot,” said Murphy to his
fireman, “hand over that tin dime.”

                    BY WILLIAM B. CHISHOLM.

                                   (From an Old Railroad Scrap Book.)

                                       The Iasi words of Engineer Edward Kennar, who died in
                                       a railroad accident near St. Johnsville, N.Y., April 18. 1887.

                                       GO, flag the train, boys, flag the train!
                                       Nor waste the time on me;

                                     But leave me by my shattered cab;
                                     ’Tis better thus to be !

                                        It was an awful leap, boys,

                                        But the worst of it is o’er;

                                        I hear the Great Conductor’s call
                                        Sound from the farther shore.

                                       I hear sweet notes of angels, boys,

                                      That seem to say: “ Well done! ”

                                          I see a golden city there,

                                        Bathed in a deathless sun ;

                                         There is no night, nor sorrow, boys,

                                     No wounds nor bruises there;

                                     The way is clear—the engineer
                                     Rests from his life’s long care.

                                      Ah! ’twas a fearful plunge, my lads;

                                       I saw, as in a dream,

                                     Those dear, dear faces looming up
                                     In yonder snowy stream;

                                    Down in the Mohawk’s peaceful depths
                                    Their image rose and smiled,

                                        E’en as we took the fatal leap;

                                   Oh, God—my wife ! my child!

                                         Well, never mind ! I ne’er shall see
                                         That wife and child again;

                                       But hasten, hasten, leave me, boys!

                                         For God’s sake, flag the train !

                                      Farewell, bright Mohawk! and farewell,

                                    My cab, my comrades all;

                                       I’m done for, boys, but hasten on,

                                      And sound the warning calll

                                       Oh, what a strange, strange tremor this
                                       That steals unceasing on !

                                        Will those dear ones I've cherished so
                                        Be cared for when I’m gone ?

                                        Farewell, ye best beloved, farewell!

O’TOOLE’S THIRD WRECK.

           BY GALVIN JOHNSTON.

       The Professor’s Predictions Came True, but O’Toole
       Engineered the Smash-Up Just to Please Himself.

 ' I r*"SIS a calm and sultry night,”
 mused the old switchman
 eft III I* as the yard - crew pressed

     I wk close around the shanty
stove, which was white-hot
from the base to the first
joint of pipe. The gaunt, weather-beaten
faces scowled on him in the infernal glow,
while the wintry tempest without raked the
shingles with a flail of ice.

  “A calm and sultry night,” mused the
old switchman.

  The others struck their foreheads and
drew back; and then the speaker was en-
abled to occupy the warmest, coziest corner
on an old coach seat in front of the stove.

  “ I wance had an uncle who discoorsed
that way av an avening,” whispered Hogan.
“ Befoore morning lie bit me, and we be-
came violent.”

  His comrades nodded significantly and
edged toward the door.

  “ Do ye set vezselfs up as a boord av
lunacy?” inquired the old switchman with
contempt. “ Some time ye will drive me
mad with stupidity, but on this occasion I
will show patience with a great effort. I
had another night in mind that w’u’d make
this wan seem tame by contrast; but ye do
not know a figure av spache.”

  “Whist! ’Tis a story, and this the night
av nights,” said Hogan. “ Only the while
ago I saw a white wan waving at me
through the snow by the abandoned cars on
the Bolivar siding.”

  “ Aye, ’tis a story,” averred the other,
raising his finger menacingly. “ The story
av a night that makes this seem wan av
still dews and roses under a summer moon.
It was the night av the third wreck on the
ould P. D. Q.”

  There was a rustling stillness, as when
an audience creeps into a darkened play-
house to sit awed arid expectant before an
empty stage. The old switchman began:

  “ Afther an age av iron coomes an age of
rust, and what I have to tell ye is of a time
so long agone that steel rails have rotted
like wood, and the fashion in smoke-stacks
has changed four times. But I ravmimber
whin Terence O’Toole was a railroad gin-
tleman of the ould school, and used to walk
thrack a few steps behint the thrains av the
P. D. Q. with a basket on his arm.

  “ As soon as the basket was full av the
bolts and brasses, which w’u’d be knocked
out of the cars with the jolting, he w’u’d
rayturn to town and sell thim to a broker in
new railroads, and thin invite the road-
masther out to drink up his per cent of
profits.

  “ Whiniver the road-bed got beaten down
to a level, and no bolts fell out, he w’u’d
rayport the thrack in bad order, and the
road-masther w’u’d sind out a siction-gang
to repair the smooth places. It was liurdle-
racers we had for thrains in the good times.
I miss thim now, though in those days no-
body did.

  “ Betwane walking up the track for the
railroad coompany with an empty basket
and returning for himself with a full wan,
the O’Toole made money ivery step of the
way. He was a prosperous man, and lent
money to the trainmen at high interest.

   “ 1 It must be high, for it is all I will iver
get,’ he says, and the trainmen made good
his wurrd.

  “ But for all this, and iverybody under
obligation to pay him high interest, O'Toole
was not a happy man.

   “ ‘ And ’tis only yezself who can make me

wan,’ he tould Mrs. Finnerty, who was a
widdy by her second hoosband and owned
the telygraph office at that station.

  “ ‘ I have whispered to meself awake; I
have shpoken it aloud in my drames, that
if I wed again, ’twill be for romance,’ said
Widdy Finnerty. She withdrew her hand
from Terry’s long enough to answer a tely-
graph-call and demand an apology from the
operator down the line.

  “ 1 ’Tis interoopting me he always is,’
she says in anger. 1 He is no thrue knight
of the wire.’

  “ ‘ No thrue what? ’ asks O'Toole.
“‘Knight, ye numskull; sure, ye have
no romance.’

  “ ‘ Romance,’ repeats Terry ; ‘ and me de-
caving the road-masther on his percentage
ivery day! Didn’t thirty-wan strike a re-
pair in the track only last wake, and thin
rain bolts and washers till she broke down?
Faith, it was like taking a train apart, and
I brought back so much of it on a hand-car
that I felt I should have a despatcher’s or-
der. And yet the road-masther got only
sivinty cints as his share, though he wanted
a dollar—the gr&edy divil! But why didn’t
he get it? ’Twas romance saved me, Mrs.
Finnerty—romance! ’

  “ She raised her head with scorn and dis-
charged a look which staggered him.

  “ ‘ Bad ’cess to ye for an ould dragon,’
says O’Toole. ‘ Happy the hoosbands who
have died av ye. And I will have ye know
that the O’Toole will be a romance to no-
body, ixcipt the road-masther.’

  “ But he had retreated softly from the
room and closed the door behint him befoore
disclosing these sintimints, for the O’Tooles
are as sly in the head as foxes.

  “ ‘ I retired with dignity,’ he said proud-
ly; ‘ and can go back for my hat to-morry.’
“Thin, it being avening, he wint over to
the house of McGraw, the freight conductor,
who had been stricken down with Katie
Malone and had married her in a spirit av
adventure.

  “ ‘ Ha! there is romance here,’ says
O’Toole, standing among the dead leaves
in the yard and listening to an uproar
which came out of the house. ‘ I will ix-
amine how it wurruks,’ he goes on, knock-
ing loud at the door and looking back to
see that nothing hard to get over was be-
tween him and the gate.

  “A silence fell inside, as if some wan
not without respect in the family had died
suddintly.

  “ ‘ ’Tis McGraw who will not stand for
nonsince,’ muses O’Toole; ‘he has put the
gag on her.’

  “ But it was Mrs. McGraw herself who
opened the door a crack, and says:

  “ ‘ G’wan with ye, polthroon as ye are;
w’u’d ye knock out the side of the house in
such an hour as this, and me by rights a
widdy? ’

  “ ‘ A widdy! ’ laments O’Toole; ‘ sorrow
the day. Thin it was a wake ye were hold-
ing instead of a love-faste.’

   “ ‘ Ah-h-h! it is yezself, is it? ’ she an-
swers, straightening up with a kind of snarl.
‘ Ye were that official. I thought it was the
call-boy for thirty-five. Perhaps ye will
coome in,’ she goes on in a bitther, suspi-
cious way through the crack av the door.

   “ ‘ I w’u’d like to see Michael only wance
more,’ whimpers O’Toole with a kind of
faintness, for it was his second widdy that
day; and he held on to the new hat he had
bought and thanked the saints there were
no stumbling-blocks to the gate.

   “ ‘ I am no knight of romance,’ he reflects
is rapidly as possible, ‘ and, if necessary,
I will take the fence.’

  “ ‘ And what have ye against my Michael,
ye human battering-ram?’ says Katie,
‘that ye w’u’d see him only wance again?
Is he not good for a constant companion,
cold-blooded money-shark, as ye are? ’

  “ O’Toole shudders at the thought.

  “ ‘ I w’u’d see him out of interest—’ he
begins.

  “ ‘ Ye will not get it till pay-day,’ she
hissed, and w’u’d have slammed the door,
but McGraw himself comes up behint in a
white sheet; and O’Toole, seeing him, falls
into the crack with a gasp.

  “ But they were kind-hearted people, who
w’u’d not let even a creditor die on their
hands and be accused of murder. Drag-
ging O’Toole inside the parlor, they held a
pint bottle under his nose.

  “ ‘ The saints be praised, I can hold my
own bottle! ’ says O’Toole ‘ and ye are not
dead at all, Michael? ’

  “ ‘ I thought ye were the call-boy,’ ex-
plains Katie sourly; ‘ and I w'u’d not have
Michael go out on the road this night, so I
sint him to bed. He is a sick man—’

   “ * I am not,’ says Michael, wresting the
bottle away from O’Toole.

  “ ‘ A man near to death is sick,’ Katie
tells him in a voice like the crack of doom.
Then O’Toole ducked his head and looked
cautiously in all directions, for he was not

the man to coome between Michael and a
fate which might be better for him.

  “ ‘ Ye w’u’d rather be kilt than at home
with me,’ goes on Katie in a sob.

  “ ‘ Thin it will not strike him here,’ says
O'Toole.

  “ ‘ It is time for the third wreck,’ Katie
answers, ‘ and he is seeking it out. Plead
with him, O’Toole,’ and she breaks down
entirely.

  “ 1 I will,’ says O’Toole, elevated by the
drink. ‘ Michael, be a man, and do as yez
wife commands. Ye have no romance.’

  “ At that wurrd Michael laughs in a hol-
low tone, and the cedar - tree beyant the
window scrapes the glass with a witch’s
laugh. But, even in the midst of weird
signs and distress, curiosity gets the betther
of thim, and the two McGraws stare into
O’Toole like owls on a hallowe’en.

  “ 4 Terence,’ says Katie, in a soft and
wheedling voice, ‘ where did ye get it? ’

  “ O’Toole felt the shivers run over him
at the way they looked.

  “ ‘ ’Twas the Widdy Finnerty gave it me.
Is it a fatal wurrd to mark me so? ’

  “They stared into him, cruel with glee,
and O’Toole goes on to change the subject
in haste.

  “ ‘ But that is better than being branded
with superstition. There is no third wreck.’
“ ‘ Listen,’ says Katie, fixing him with a
long forefinger; ‘ first coomes wan wreck;
thin another wan, which makes two; and
after thim, a third. Count thim yezself, ye
scoffer! It is so on ivery road, and we have
had two little wrecks; now coomes on a big
wan. The profissor who takes thim down
on a blackboard told me so this day. He
gets spirits in sayances, and harkens to thim
like a man of sinse.’

  “ ‘ Thay arc fools who listen,’ responds
O’Toole boldly.

  “ ‘ The Widdy Finnerty was there.’

  “ ‘ Who listen, and thin belave in it,’ goes
on O’Toole less boldly, for he raysons:

‘ Katie will tell the widdy I said this, and
1 will be out a hat.’

  “ ‘ Arrah, listen how he changes his tune.
It is noble of ye, Terence; ye have romance.
But, Michael, ye have none, and w’u’d
rather risk yez life on the road than at
home. Wurra, ■wurra’ she chants, rocking
back and forth, 1 I am a lone woman; he
has no romance.’

  “ ‘ A curse on ye, O’Toole, for bringing
the wurrd into my home,’ growls McGraw.
‘ It was all happy till ye came.’

  “ ‘ I heard ye celybrating yez happiness
from the strate,’ says O’Toole, made desper-
ate between the two of thim. '

  “ 1 Yis, yis, it was all happy till he came,’
sobs Katie, and thin they thrust O’Toole
outside and slammed the door against him
without his hat.

  “ ‘ ’Tis a fatal wurrd,’ he thinks, and
goes home in the winter wind with a hand-
kerchief tied around his head.

  “ 1 I am a practical man,’ he told him-
self over and over before going to bed; but,
later, he drove on in dreams with the Widdy
Finnerty till the clocks struck midnight, and
thin he woke up to be rid of thim.

  “ ‘ May the fiends strike ye dumb,’ he
says of the clocks for taking a low advan-
tage of him. ‘ Ye have set me to struggle
against my fate in an evil hour.

  “ 1 Perhaps I am not to blame; there is
romance in the blood of the O’Tooles, and
my grandfather married his landlord’s
daughter in Kilkenny. My curse light on
him; he w’u’d rather fall in love than pay
rent. He has set me a bad example, and I
will go back after my hat to-morry.’

  “ And he’s awake till the morning, whin
he mates Widdy Finnerty at the door of the
telygraph office.

  “ —Woman, I have it,’ he says at Wance,
‘ romance will crop out in spite of me, for it
is in the blood of the O'Tooles.’

  “ But she looks on him with a wicked
eye.

  “ ‘ Sorrow the day we should talk about
romance,’ she answers, ‘ whin there is wreck
and destruction hanging over us all.’

  “ 1 Is it the profissor of ghosts again? ’
ixclaims O'Toole in anger. ‘ Sure, hasn’t
the wrecking-train been the only wan run
on time since the road was built? Ye are
as downcast as if the pay - car was in
trouble.’

  “ 1 Ye think of nothing but loot and sal-
ary,’ says she. ‘ Do ye niver raymimber the
wurruld of spirits? OToole, if ye had ro-
mance, ye w’u’d sacrifice something to it.’

  “ ‘ I will sacrifice the profissor of ghosts,’
threatens O’Toole; ‘ or ye will soon have
him writing out the bulletin-boords in a
trance in a dark room, and not a man will
go on the road for fear of the third wreck.’
“ But, ever responsive to the call of duty,
Mrs. Finnerty answered a telygraph-call
and refused to take a train-order till she had
hung up her cloak.

  “ And O’Toole worried with the thought
av sacrificing for romance, stole his own hat

and quickly retired before she could drive
him away.

  “ * Since every wan is now afraid to run
on the'track, I will not even risk walking
along it,’ he says, and goes over to Flaher-
ty’s saloon, where the spread of the pro-
fissor’s prophecy has driven the trainmen to
buy whisky on credit.

  “ He did not see the profissor till late
that afternoon, and thin it was through the
windy of the telvgraph office, sitting cozy
and comfortable with the Widdy Finnerty.

     He does not look like a man of spirits
and prophecy,’ thinks O'Toole, for the pro-
fissor would not consint to be haunted out of
business hours, and whin O’Toole wint in
he was shaking the fat sides of him.

  ‘“ ’Tis Profissor Anonymous, O'Toole,’
says the widdy proudly, and Terence sat
down to study him.

  “‘This is a comfortable man,’ mutters
O’Toole aside, ‘ but ’tis not meself who can
be fooled with fat and a magic name.

  “ ‘ I had an ancestor who was own brother
to ye,’ he says with a kind of cruel chuckle
to himself, and well remembering that his
ancestor was the greatest scoundrel out of
County Cork.

  “ But the other caught the glame of jeal-
ousy in his eye and smiled in a kindly way.

  “ ‘ Whist,’ he says, while the widdy was
busy at the instrument. ‘ Some ancestors
must be lived up to, and some lived down.
I will not expose ye in this wan.’

“ ‘ ’Tis a waste of wurrds, and yet I have
the worst of it,’ thinks O’Toole. ‘ I must
be cautious, for he is a low and crafty man.’
“ ‘My ancestor was a collecthor of ban-
shees,’ he goes on, afther reflection.

  “‘They are poor craytures,’ replies the
profissor with a yawn, ‘ but they were useful
whin paying a landlord—with curses.’
‘“’Tis little we know,’ says the Widdy
Finnerty, and O’Toole agreed with her.

     It is betther to nod, whin for a shake
I would be thrown out again into the cold,
and thin backbitten around a hot stove.’
“The dusk creeps on, and they sit dis-
coursing till the road-master drops in and
sinds O’Toole after his per cent of gin.
Thin they sip away softly, the stove crim-
son hot in their midst, while the blizzard
caterwauls in the chimney-fiue.

  “They tell of ghosts and warnings, and
build cozy little wrecks on the floor bay-
fore thim. So they stare, and are afraid
of wan another in the bloody light, and are
ready for another dram of gin.

  “Only vvance does the O’Toole venture
himself in speech, but he rankles with jeal-
ousy of the other guests and thinks:

  “ ‘ Why did I niver suspect that every

man was crazy about her? Now I must
hold my own against these ghostmongers,
and since I cannot tell even wan tale, I will
deny thim all.

  “ ‘ There is nothing into it,’ he spakes out
boldly. ‘ The trainmen were scared enough
about the third wreck, and now, with yez
prophecies in the wind, they threaten to
murder the call-boy if he finds thim. Soon
we will have to run our trains wild, without
crews or orders.’

  “ The other two would have turned against
him, for that day it was fated that O’Toole
should be put outdoors by relays, but the
profissor raised his hand.

  “ 4 Let him rave on,’ he commands. 4 A
misguided man will wreck himself.’

  “‘ Hoo to ye all,’ exclaims O’Toole, con-
timptuous with jealousy and gin. 4 I w’u’d
take out a train meself, alone, without orders
or signals; 'tis the man of spirit against the
men of spooks.’

  44 The profissor gazed at him, and the
eyes in his fat face were like two red signal-
lamps twinkling by an open switch.

  44 4 Ye have shpoken. Ye will be the
third wreck,’ he says in a voice of doom.

  44 Being a condemned man, the others
went away and left him, the two gentlemen
escorting the widdy, who looked back at
him wance with a tearful eye. So O’Toole
glowered on by the stove, and snarled at the
night operator.

  “41 will not go home till after mid-
night,’ he mutters. 4 A curse on the hour
of romance.’ And, on after-thought, he ex-
tends this to the profissor and the road-
master.

  “Now, all that week, above the foot-hills
where the station lay, wild geese had been
crying to the south from the gray of morn-
ing. Wurrd had come down the line of
cloud banners flying from the peaks beyant
and of Indians who had crept in from the
warpath to smoke the pipe of peace by the
station stoves.

  “‘Faith, the blizzard has arrived on
time,’ mutters O’Toole as he steps onto the
platform and is whirled around the corner
of the station-house in a tornado of gray
and black.

  “With head down, he plunges up the
track toward home till he comes to the
siding of abandoned cars, where the doors

creak back and forth and the brake-chains
rattle in the wind.

  “ ‘ Ye black skeletons, do ye prophesy
against me, too?’ he scowls back at thirn.
1 Sure, ’tis a fine, wild special ye wud make
for the third wreck! Without orders or
signals! ’ he growls as lie goes on.

  “ Soon lie is sorry he has spoken so to
thim, for at home and in bed he cannot sleep
for dreaming that he is coasting down the
foot-hills, on a bad-order special, outstrip-
ping the hurricane. And the voice av the
WiddyFinnerty gives him the thrain order:

  “ ‘ Meet the first thrain ye come to—
head-on. Ye are sacrificing for romance.’

  “‘Meet thim head-on!’ cries O’Toole,
starting up in bed with the cold sweat on
his forehead. ‘ ’Tis a sign of the times,’ he
says. ‘ Yisterday I gave up to romance;
to-morry I must knuckle down to sacrifice.
Yet, I w’u’d not run into danger, except
blindly.’

  “ Dangerous the wan who broods by pipe
and candle of a stormy night, and the
O’Toole was a man-trap when he schemed.

  “ ‘ The profissor has profissed against
me,’ says Terence. 1 Sure, it is this train of
thought which will make a wreck of me.’

  “ ‘ I have it,’ he chuckles, and bites in
two the pipestem. ‘ I will yield to the
prophecy, and it will be a pitfall to him.’

  “ All that next day he chuckles till after-
noon, and thin he walks down the track in
clouds of snow till he coomes to the aban-
doned cars.

  “ ‘ Ould death cells, ye are the prophet’s
special,’ he says to them, and knocks out a
coupling-pin four cars from the head end.
By which token it is proved that the dis-
turbing dream still ran wild in the brain
of him.

  “ He laughs at the storm on the way to
the telegraph office.

  “ ‘I am in such high humor, I w’u’d be
welcome anywhere,’ he thinks. ‘ The widdy
will beam with joy to see me and to hear
that I will make any sacrifice for romance
of her.’

  “ So he stamps into the telygraph office,
and calls ‘ The top of the day,’ as he stands
blinking in the rosy glare of the stove.

  “There, sipping a hot wan, sits Widdy
Finnerty, the profissor, the road-masther,
and the two McGraws.

  “1 Here he is again,’ they welcome him,
and O'Toole shrinks with its significance.

  “‘Do ye not know me?’ he asks. ‘I
will show my face by the stove.’

  “ ‘ We know ye,’ says the road-masther.
‘ Have ye any money ? ’

  “‘I have not,’ answers O’Toole cau-
tiously.

  “ ‘Thin ye are an intruder,’ says the
road-masther.

  “ They all look at him, but O’Toole looks
at the Widdy Finnerty where she sits, trim
and pink-cheeked, with the black eyes of
her cast down to the floor.

  “ ‘ I will have a by-wurrd with ve,’ he
says, and defying thim all, he leans over and
whispers:

  “ ‘ I will sacrifice, widdy, or do anything
to be rid of romance.’

  “ She blushes and startles, and the others,
leaning forward indifferently, overhear the
wurrd.

  “ ‘ Shame on ye,’ spakes up McGraw’s
wife, ‘ to be making love in public. Sure,
Michael w’u’d niver do so; nor at home,
either, for that matter. Och hone! I am
a lone woman! ’

     Hold! I will foretell the fate of him,’
puts in the profissor sorrowfully.

  “ ‘ Niver mind,’ commands O’Toole.

  “ ‘ We know it already,’ say the McGraws
and the road-masther.

  “‘ Ye lie. I will not be hung,’ exclaims
O’Toole. ‘ Besides, the profissor foretold
only yesterday that I would be the third
wreck, which ye should be by rights, Mc-
Graw, if ye were not afraid to go out on the
road.’

  “ They regard him like a jury of crows
on a gallows-tree, and thin McGraw the
wife titters in a sly fashion and whispers
to her husband:

  “ ‘ The third wreck,’ she says, looking
from the Widdy Finnerty to O’Toole, and
bringing to mind the two husbands who had
gone before—for she was jealous of the
widdy’s romance.

  “Mrs. Finnerty took in the significance
with a kind of gasp: her eyes began to
flicker, and as she bared her teetli with the
purr of a leopard, the sounder on the tely-
graph-table opened up with a crash.

  “There she was in a minute, taking a
message and quivering with excitemint,
while McGraw led out his wife softly, and
the road-masther followed thim.

  “ ‘ A lantern! A lantern! ’ Mrs. Finnerty
began to cry, for evening had fallen heavy
and black and streaked with snow.

  “‘A lantern,’ says O’Toole, and lights
the two—red and white.

  “ ‘ 'Tis this,’ goes on the widdy, turning
O’TOOLE’S THIRD WRECK.

to thim with sharp, quick wurrds: ‘Riley
slipped from the gangway of his engine
while bringing her up the yards at Division
Station, and now she is running wild this
way. It is thirty miles. She will be up
here in half an hour or less.’

  “ ‘ With the down passenger due here in
twinty minutes,’ cries O’Toole, grasping the
lanterns. ‘Is it on time?’

  “ During all this she had been calling
on the key, but received no answer.

  “ ‘ I cannot tell,’ and she throws up her
arms in despair. ‘ It is like to be a little
late, and the wires are all down with the
storm on the mountain division. There
may be no time to get thim into siding. Ye
must flag thim. Run—fly—the two of ye!
Though it is like they will run past your
signal in the blizzard, ye must get thim
into the upper siding if possible.’

  “Throwing their overcoats at thim, she
pushes O’Toole and the profissor out into
the snow.

  “ They fight their way into the gale and
through the drifts, for the tempest has risen
till it seems to have blown the mountains
down and left a clear track from the pole.

  “ It takes some time to reach the aban-
doned cars, where the track is swept clear
and slippery by the wind, and here the
profissor stumbles over Terry’s foot and
falls, grasping at him. The lanterns crash
into bits, and they both lie still in the
darkness.

  “‘Blast ye for a true prophet!’ yells
O’Toole, scrambling to his fate. ‘ Ye have
predicted evil till ye have brought it to
pass.’ But he laughs in his saycret thoughts,
for the runaway engine and the profissor’s
accident only make perfect the scheme he
already had in mind.

  “ ‘ The abandoned cars—the Death Spe-
cial,’ he repeats aloud, and a kind of wild
dream takes possession av him. ‘ Faith, I
will give thim a third wreck which will
split the system wide open.’

  “ It is not only excitement which makes _
him grab the profissor by the throat. ‘ I
will give him a dose of his own magic,’ he
thinks.

  “ ‘ I have a sayance,’ he screeches in the
other’s ear. ‘It is my own ghost I see
beyant, and it beckons me to ride down the
wild engine on a death special. Come!
We will throw the switch, and whin we are
out, ye must close it for the passinger!’

  “ They throw the switch, and O’Toole
kicks the blocks from under the wheels of

             4

the front car, and thin springing up the
ladder, runs down the string.

  “ ‘ It is lucky this switch is straight up
and down,’ he thinks as he starts for the
front again, letting the brakes fly as he
goes. ‘ It was like backing thim up a hill-
side to git thim here.’

  “ As the last brake lets go, a rusty howl
runs along the train, and they begin bang-
ing over the switch on the way down the
foot-hills.

  “‘ I will control thim so they won’t jump
at the curves,’ he yells as they pass the pro-
fissor, who stands dumb with fright at this
madness and the fear of a strange ghost.
1 Tell the widdy it is the sacrifice. She has
given me my orders. Wurroo, wurroo! ’ he
shrieks, flinging up his hands. ‘ On with
the wind, ye old ruins! We will strike that
engine like a thunderbolt.’

  “As they sweep past the station, the
widdy, with starting eyes, sees that figure of
swinging arms and a white, flapping sheet
of snow, and falls in a dead faint across
the telygraph-table.

  “And O’Toole the conductor on the wild-
est train that ever dived down the plateau
from the mountain division!

  “‘ It will be black magic to thim,’ he is
chuckling in spite of the cold, and he sets
the brakes on the four cars ahead till they
had slowed down, and prisintly he kicks
thim all off, wan after another, beginning
with the first. Thin he jumps to the fifth
car and sets the brakes, and this being the
point where he had knocked out the coup-
ling-pin during the afternoon, the four cars
leave the others behint and shoot off into
the darkness like the black puff out of a
cannon.

  “ ‘ The train is too long, so I run ye in
two sections,’ says O’Toole. ‘ The first sec-
tion will meet the wild engine and take
siding in the ditch; and thin the second,
with the conductor aboord, will slide down
gently to the scene of wreck.’

  “ He had schemed this way of separating
the old cars, and thin smashing thim to-
gether again before he had ever heard of
the wild engine.

  “ ‘ I would let ye go lickety split now,’
he says, ‘ but a man cannot be expicted to
walk to the scene of his own sacrifice.
Hereafter I am all for sacrifice and ro-
mance,’ he says, going back to the middle of
his train to set a few more brakes.

  “Then something beyond his calculation
happens, and there is a crash which pitches

him off into a deep drift, while the old cars
pile up wan after another in a scrap-heap
on top of the engine.

  “And what has happened? Ah, ’tis the
black magic of Terence O’Toole, which no
wan was iver able to explain. But the
secret of the affair is, that the four cars
he had turned loose against the engine had
jumped from a curve at that very spot.
And the wild engine coming along, tamed
down with the cold, had smashed into the
second section.	• /

  “ Whin they ran the passenger train down
slowly to the wreck, they found O’Toole,
half buried in snow, sitting on the scrap-
heap with his head in his hands. And
here was part of the cars piled up on the
engine, and two hundred yards further down
was four more cars lying alongside the
track.

  “ The road-masther, who had come down
on the train with the profissor, considered
all this and asked:

  “‘How did ye do it?’ And O’Toole,
with the Widdy Finnerty’s arms around his
neck, stared at the profissor in the light of
the trainmen’s lanterns.

  “ ‘ I had a sayence,’ he told thim, ‘ and
jumped the first four cars over the engine,
and thin came down on top. It is the best
way to stop an engine, but it was all wan
spirit could do.’

  “ In the wild, ghostly night, by the light
of the lanterns, no wan knew what to an-
swer, for it could not be figured out by a
sane mind at any time.

  “ ‘ Do ye understhand? ’ cries the Widdy
Finnerty to the trainmen. 1 He has sacri-
ficed for ye, and taken the third wreck into
his own hands.’

  “ But she goes on in a whisper to O’Toole:

‘ I understand still better than thim. Ye
are a true knight of romance, and for the

sake of me ran down a wild engine on a
lunatic train.’

  “ With a separate ache from every bone
in his body, O’Toole heard her with indig-
nation.

  “‘And she believes me fool enough to
carry romance so far. Sure, I supposed the
box-cars would stay on the track long
enough to smash the engine before I came
up. Still, I will be the safer for that
belief.’

  “ So he held his peace on this and only
said: ‘ The profissor prophesied that I
should be the third wreck.’

  “Well, remembering the wurrds of Mrs.
McGraw, the Widdy Finnerty turned from
the profissor with scorn. ‘ Terence O’Toole,’
he says, looking him squarely in the eye,
‘ what ye have done this night shows ye
need not be afraid to fulfil any prophecies.’
“ ‘ I am not,’ answers O’Toole, and he
exulted over his rival.

  “ ‘ Sure, I have belittled him as a pro-
fissor of ghosts,’ he thinks, ‘ by relating the
way I raised the cars over the wild engine.
He was armed against truth at every point,
but I routed him with a lie. It is always
best—in the end.’ ”

  “ It was a good tale,” said Hogan with a
sigh. “ The O'Toole was a warm-blooded
man.”

  “ This night seems like wan on the equa-
tor, compared with the night O’Toole took
out the Death Special,” suggested the old
switchman.

  “ It does,” answered Hogan emphatically.
“ Thin ye will not mind running up the
yard beyant the roundhouse and closing the
switch for twinty-sivin? ”

  “ That I will not mind,” answered Ho-
gan, and lost in thought, without overcoat
or gloves, he walked forth into the bitter
wind and blinding snow.
The World’s Greatest Juggler

BY EDWIN MORRIS.

NOTWITHSTANDING the historical interest attached to the great engi-
neering achievements of the past, we are fast coming to regard even the
great pyramids of Gizah as but the work of children compared with the
modern miracles of construction. Bigger and better is the constant cry, and
no matter how startling the demand, our present-day engineers have rarely"
failed to deliver the goods when sufficient funds were forthcoming.

    As Mr. Morris points out in his article, give the mechanical engineer suf-
ficient money to work with and there is practically nothing imaginable in the
line of constructive operations that he will not undertake to carry to a successful
completion. While no engineer will ever find himself facing the problem of
moving the Brooklyn Bridge to Europe or digging a vent for Mount Vesuvius
in Paris, who can tell but what even greater things may some day be asked
of the men who are now at work building skyscrapers, tunneling rivers, and
moving mountains.

Impractical Feats That Engineers Have Brought Within the Realm of Prob-
ability, and the Various Aids That Have Helped
Them to Success.

gasp hard when we first see them, and forth-
with we begin to marvel at the wonderful
ingenuity that piled so many millions of
tons of stone upon stone. Two thousand
years from now, the natives who live here-
about will wonder why we ever gave a
pleasant word to the pyramid builders when
we had so much greater men for our living
neighbors.

  For the mechanical engineer of the pres-
ent day is indeed a wonder. His profession
has existed barely a half century, but he
lias done amazing things. More nearly,
perhaps, than in the case of any other man,
nothing is impossible to him. Give him
the money and he will do almost anything
that any one wants done.

  That’s quite a bit to say. All of Mr.
Harriman’s money wouldn’t have enabled
his physicians to prolong his life a second.
If the wealth of the world were given to
Edison himself, he probably could neither
increase nor decrease by one the millions of

          LITTLE while ago Thomas
            A. Edison suggested that
            Manhattan Island might
            profitably be more than
            doubled in size by filling
            .06	up the East River and

digging a new stream five miles back of the
present western water-front of Brooklyn.

  “ It would be a very easy thing to do,”
he said. “ It would be only a third-rate
engineering feat. Steam - shovels, could
scoop out the new river, and trains could
carry the earth and dump it into the old
one. They are doing a much more difficult
job out in Seattle. They are moving a
mountain. I’ve seen them doing it. The
mountain was in the way, so they are just
pulling it up by the roots and carting it
off.”

  This is all an old story to Mr. Edison,
but most of the world does not yet realize
what a wonderful man is the mechanical
engineer. The Egyptian Pyramids make us

eggs that are annually laid by a fish. But
the mechanical engineer—from what project
would he fly?

  I put what I thought was a poser to a
New York member of the profession.

  “If you were offered enough money,” I
asked. “ would you take a contract to mount
the Brooklyn Bridge on wheels and drag it
across the bed of the Atlantic Ocean to
Europe?”

  “Of course I would,” he replied without
a moment’s hesitation.

  “ Isn’t the bed of the ocean filled with
mud—probablv to the depth of hundreds of
feet?”

A Hard Nut to Crack.

  “It is in some places. But what of it?
If money were no object, tires so wide could
be put on the wheels that they would not
sink. Besides, if I wanted to, I could make
the wheels rest so lightly on the bed of the
ocean that they could almost go oyer egg-
shells without breaking them. I could
simply attach big air-chambers to the
bridge, let the chambers be submerged, and
regulate the weight on the wheels by pump-
ing in water or air.”

  That sounded pretty good. But how
could the bridge be drawn? The bed of the
ocean is a succession of hills and valleys,
very much like the hills and valleys that we
see on the surface of the earth. Some
power would be required now and then to
pull the bridge along.

  “ Would the seventy thousand horse-pow-
er engines on the Mauretania pull the
bridge?” he was asked.

  “ No, they wouldn’t,” he replied. “ Sev-
enty thousand horse-power wouldn’t get the
load over the first hill. But a seven million
horse-power engine can be made just as
easily, so far as the mechanical problem
involved in its construction is concerned, as
an engine can to run a coffee-mill.

  “The only real problem in building an
engine strong enough to drag the Brooklyn
Bridge across the ocean’s bed to Europe
would be to supply its boilers with coal.
The Mauretania’s boilers use a thousand
tons of doal a day. Such an engine as I
have in mind might require all the steam
that could be made each day from 100,000
tons of coal.

  As the trip across the ocean would re-
quire a good many days, it would be pretty
difficult to build a ship of such enormous

coal-carrying capacity, but a fleet of colliers
would answer the same purpose.

  “The project would be simple enough in
principle. Its difficulty would lie only in
the greatness of the task to which the prin-
ciple might be applied. But the Brooklyn
Bridge could be dragged to Europe, all
right; and if the contractor were asked to
do so, and were paid for doing so, he could
bring the rock of Gibraltar back with him
on pontoons and set it up in Central Park
—or in Kansas, for that matter.”

  What a combination of suggestions! Im-
agine the consternation of a school of whales
at the sight of the Brooklyn Bridge! A sea-
serpent of steel on wheels. But, at that,
the whales wouldn’t have anything on the
English, if they were to lose the rock—or
upon the Kansans, if they were to get it.
Maybe it’s a good thing that mechanical
engineers cannot always get all the money
they would need to do all of the things they
could do. For instance:

  “ Could you take the fifty-story Metro-
politan Tower,” I asked, “move it up
Broadway to Forty-Second Street, and lay
it lengthwise along the car tracks, without
breaking a window or cracking any plas-
ter?”

  “That would be harder than taking the
Brooklyn Bridge across the Atlantic,” he
replied, “ but it could be done. Not only
could it be done, but if the timepiece in the
tower were run by a spring instead of by
weights, the building could be moved and
laid down on its side without stopping die
clock. Don’t think that I am minimizing
the difficulty of the task. I am not.

Encased in Steel.

  “ The building would probably have to
be encased in steel to give it sufficient rigid-
ity to keep it from breaking in two when
it was laid down. Special appliances of
enormous size would also have to be made
to ease the building down from an erect to
a reclining posture; but with no limit placed
upon expense, all of these things could be
accomplished.

  “ The tower, in fact, could be moved
miles across the country. The moving of
any building, no matter how great, is not
an insurmountable mechanical problem.
The weight and the height of a building
simply increase the difficulty of applying
principles that, in themselves, are simple.
It is a well-known principle, for instance.

  that a stream of water presses against every
square inch of a piston-head with the same
— intensity that the water is forced through
the pipe.

Would Move Mountains.

     “ In other words, if a stream of water an
  inch square, at a pressure of ten pounds
  to the square inch, be pumped against a
  piston-head containing ten square inches,
  the pressure on the piston is ten pounds for
  each inch, or one hundred pounds. This
  rule holds good, no matter how small the
  stream of water or how large the piston.

     “ Here is a single mechanical principle
  with which one could almost move moun-
  tains. Put a stream of water an inch
  Square and under two hundred pounds
  pressure against a piston-head ten feet
  square, and you have a power equal to the
  weight of 34,560,000 pounds. Enough hy-
  draulic devices of this kind would almost
  drag Manhattan Island down into the bay.”

    “ How about plugging Vesuvius, as a
  dentist would fill an old tooth, and building
  a new subterranean outlet, the crater of
  which would be in Paris? Could that be
  done? ”

     “ You are getting now,” he replied, “ into
  things that are so purely fanciful that the
  mind can hardly conceive them as possi-
  bilities; but I suppose there is no reason
  why Vesuvius could not be stuffed up and
  a new outlet made if any one wanted the
  job done and had the money to pay for it.
  Filling the crater would be simply a matter
  of stonework, while making a new outlet,
  the crater of which should be in Paris,
  would be only a gigantic job of tunneling.

Tombs of the Royalty.

     “ If the ancients could build the pyramids
  without any power except that of their own
  muscles and the muscles of animals, I guess
  we moderns could fill the crater of Vesuvius,
  if we wanted to, by using steam-engines
  and electricity. And what is true of the
  stonework would also be true of the tun-
  neling. Power and machinery will work
  out almost any mechanical problem. Tun-
  nels were made even before the pyramids
  were built, and during the Middle Ages
  some pretty big works of this kind were
  successfully carried out.”

    All of which is true. The country
  around the Nile was the scene, more than

twenty centuries ago, of the first tunnel-
building. When an Egyptian king hopped
on the throne, his first thought was not of
where he 'would buy his new touring-car,
but of where he would rest his weary bones
when he no longer wanted them to hang his
clothes 011. He must have a tomb ; not a
four-dollar plot in a cemetery with a glass
of pansies on it, but a grave hewn out of
the rock, with a pyramid over it.

  More than that, a long tunnel must lead
to the room in which his valuable bones
were eventually to lie, and therefore the
first part of the task was to build the tun-
nel. On such occasions it was the custom
of the king to sing out to one of his boss
menials:

  “ Bill, get forty thousand or fifty thousand
men around here right away; set part of
them to digging a tunnel, and put the rest
of them to work toting stone. I expect to
be dead in about sixty years, and there is
no time to lose.”

  That sounds funny, but in its essence it
is a fact. Labor was plentiful—all a king
had to do was to go out and catch what
men he wanted, and on Saturday nights
no envelopes were ever passed around—but
progress was pitifully slow. There was no
machinery, no steam-engines, no dynamite,
no rock-drills.

For a Rapid Exit.

  The only wav to get a stone up to the top
was to lasso it with a rope, hitch it to a
block and tackle, and set all of the men,
camels, and elephants to pulling. Getting
through rock was a matter of picks and
shovels, sledge-hammers, fire, and water.

  When the work became so hard that the
pick-and-shovel gang were on the point of
knocking off and going out to murder the
king, a huge fire was built beside the rock.
When the stone became hotter than a burned
boot, water was dashed on it, which, cool-
ing the rock suddenly, caused it to crack.

  In the Middle Ages, kings and other
particular persons reversed things a bit.
They built tunnels, not to stay dead in, but
to keep alive in. The people, in those days,
had the habit of going out periodically to
lift the kings’ scalps. Of course, it was a
nervy proceeding, and the monarchs resisted.

  They provided themselves with suits of
armor; also with soldiers who were sworn
to have their whiskers pulled out by the
roots and their brains beaten out with clubs
340

rather than see their dear kings breathe
their last. But the kings always knew their
soldiers were likely to change their minds
after receiving, in rapid succession, three
swift kicks, so royal genius provided a
means of saving life when honor and the
winter groceries had been lost.

  Tunnels were built from the -basements of
the monarchical castles to secluded places
in the distance that commanded good views
of the country roads. It was doubtless fig-
ured out that the rulers, on the pretext of
going do'\n to put coal on the furnace,
could grab a prince under each arm, open
the tunnel door, and beat it for the country.
Anyway, they had tunnels in those days—
some of them a mile long.

  During the latter part of the seventeenth
century things began to liven up a little
when gunpowder was first used to cut sub-
terranean passages. The French built a
tunnel five hundred and ten feet long at
Malpas, but the engineer who built it wasn’t
much. All he couid do was to cut through
stone. If he had been told to drive a tun-
nel through soft soil, he would have thrown
up his job. Nobody, at that time, had ever
tunneled through anything except rock. It
was the popular impression that earth, if it
were trifled with, would cave in.

  So it would. But these same French, in
1803, found a way to stop it. By timbering
the sides, they built a tunnel twenty-four
feet wide for the St. Augustine Canal, and
not a man was killed. Really modern tun-
nel-building began on that job.

McAdoo’s 1 unnels.

  But it was not until the coming of the
railroad that the great necessity arose for
roadways under the soil. Every little while
there came a place where a train ought to
go through a hill rather than around it.
Between 1820 and 1826 the Manchester and
Liverpool Railroad built two tunnels in
England—the first railroad tunnels in the
world. The Allegheny Portage Railroad
Company, in 1831, built the first railroad
tunnel in the United States.

  The English and American engineers
who put these works through undoubtedly
stood high in their professions, and quite
as certainly believed they were rare gen-
iuses. Maybe they were—for their day.
But they would have had a nice time driving
a tunnel under the Hudson River, as Mr.
McAdoo did.

  If work had begun from each side of the
river, with the intention of having the ends
of the tunnel meet under midstream, it is
doubtful if either crew ever would have
seen the other. One crowd probably would
have tapped the river and been drowned,
while the other might have gone too far
down and been boring yet. However, the
two ends of Mr. McAdoo’s tunnel came
together within an inch.

  Machinery and higher professional skill
have alone made such progress possible.
Since Mr. McAdoo finished the Hudson
River tunnels that connect New York with
Jersey City and Hoboken, machines have
even been invented that can work through
rock more rapidly than can dynamite or any
other explosive.

The Hardest Thing on Earth.

  A constant bombardment is kept up on
the face of the rock by a multitude of drills.
The drills are set in a steel disk of the same
diameter as the tunnel, and, as the disk is
moved around, the entire surface of the
rock is battered down in one operation.

  Thomas A. Edison had this machine in
mind when he recently told me that nothing
would so much advance construction work
that must proceed through rock as the dis-
covery of a large pocket of black diamonds.

  A black diamond is the hardest thing on
earth. Beside it, a white diamond is a
piece of hickory, and a steel knife-blade is
a piece of clfeese. Because of its exceeding
hardness, a black diamond makes the best
cutting-point for a rock-drill. Mr. Edison
said he had a diamond-pointed drill that
had worked through a thousand feet of rock
without perceptibly dulling its edge.

  “ I don’t know why black diamonds are
so scarce,” he said. “ They are nothing but
pure carbon, like the white stone, but na-
ture does not seem to have made many of
them. Maybe nature has made a lot of
them and put them in out of the way places
where we have not yet found them. I hope-
this is the case. Certainly the discovery of
a large number of black diamonds would
expedite rock work as nothing else could.”

  Still, the modern mechanical engineer
now and then does wonders of the first class
with the present limited supply of black
diamonds.

  The rebuilding of the New York Central
terminal in New York City is really about
as marvelous an undertaking as would be
THE WORLD'S GREATEST JUGGLER.

the dragging of the Brooklyn Bridge to
Europe along the ocean’s bed. Tracks are
being juggled around as if they were straws;
some trains are running forty feet above
others; dynamite and drills are shattering
the solid rock upon which the terminal is to
stand; three thousand trains are coining in
and going out every day; thousands of tons
of baggage and tens of thousands of pas-
sengers are handled every day; and, although
the work has been in progress almost five
years, no train has been delayed a minute
because of the work, and no passenger has
been inconvenienced. Section-men out in
the country who cannot replace a r.ail with-
out holding up a freight-train can perhaps
appreciate the magnitude of this achieve-
ment better than can any one else.

  To get back to the building-juggling
problem, there is at least one man in this
country who believes the time will come
within fifty years when every skyscraper in
New York, including the fifty-story MetroJ
politan Tower, will be taken down. This
man is Sidney A. Reeve, an eminent pro-
fessor of steam-engineering, a political
economist of note, and the author of a book
entitled “ The Cost of Competition.”

  Professor Reeve differs from those men
who believe the skyscraper will come down
because it cannot stand up. So far as the
strength of its materials are concerned, he
sees no reason why tall steel buildings
should not stand for centuries. He does
not believe earthquakes, electrolysis, or tor-
nadoes will ever be sufficient to cause them
to fall.

  But he does believe that men will volun-
tarily remove the last skyscraper, within
the next half-century, for the reason that
the conditions of life will, by that time,
have so changed that no demand will exist
for extremely high buildings, and that their
owners will then remove" them. Buildings
that do not pay interest on the investment
are always quickly transformed, he says,
into structures that are needed. This is
the way he figures out that skyscrapers
must go.

  This is the age of barter. Men congre-
gate in cities to buy and sell the things that
other men have grown or made in the coun-
try, or in the smaller towns. In the business
of bartering there are such great opportu-
nities for getting money that there is much
competition among the barterers for offices
in which to carry on their work, and as
bartering can be done on a big scale only
in the great cities, offices have to be built
high into the air, to make room for those
who desire to engage in this occupation.

  The professor, of course, may or may not
be right; but any time that there is a demand
for the removal of the Metropolitan Tower
there will be men to do the work, even if the
contract calls for the taking away of the
building without tearing away a stone or
knocking a speck of gold-leaf from the dome.
If the development of the flying-machine
should render bridges useless, the steel
passageway to Brooklyn can be wheeled off
to Africa as a plaything for baby elephants,
provided enough money be forthcoming to
pay the bill.

RAILROAD BUILT BY CHINAMEN.

THE Sun-ning Railroad in China, now nearly
completed, is unique for that country in
that none but Chinamen have been employed in
any capacity in its construction, something that
can be said of no other road in China.

  It is being built under the direction of Chin
Gee Hee, president of the railroad, who returned
to China from the United States after about forty
years’ experience, some of which was as a railroad
foreman and contractor. He has no engineering
or railroad knowledge other than the experience
gained while he was sojourning here in the
United States.

  He has the help of about one hundred Chinese
foremen and laborers who came back from the
XTnited States, all with more or less experience in
railroad construction. The construction work

commenced in the middle of 1906, and part of the
line was opened to traffic at the beginning of 1908.
The whole road is provided with telephone lines
for despatching.

  The president and constructor of the railway
has never received more than a nominal salary of
about $40 per month. The master mechanic re-
ceives .$20; fitters, $7.50 to $17,50; blacksmiths,
$12.50 to $15; engine-drivers, $12.50 to $22.50;
firemen, $7.50 to $9; conductors, $12.50; brake-
men, $7.50 to $10; ticket-sellers, $10; ticket-col-
lectors, $7.50 to $10; gang foremen, $7.50 to
$12.50; foremen carpenters, $20; and carpenters,
$7.50 to $12.50, all per month.

  Coolies receive 20 cents per day. Ten hours
of labor constitute a day's work.—Erie Railroad

SHAKY BANKS COMES BACK.

BY GEORGE FOXHALL.

           How Railroad History Was Made When
           Bob Malloy Met with an Accident.

kHAKY BANKS was not a good
man to fool with on ordinary oc-
casions, and there wasn’t a man
on the Western division who
dared call him “ Shaky ” to
his face. But he was shaky,
nevertheless; everybody knew it,
and he knew it himself. That’s why his
friends never gave him the nickname, and
that’s why his enemies daren’t, for in the
ordinary acts of life, such as a scrap or a
lark, Shaky had muscles like a tiger’s and
the precise movements of a prize-fighter.

  A fine figure of a man was Tom Banks,
and as fine a fellow as ever eased steam
into a greedy throttle, but—shaky. In the
flash of emergency some sort of nerve par-
alysis took hold of him, and his limbs be-
came like the limbs of an infant. -The
same thing gripped his- brain, and he
thought and did the wrong thing whenever
the thinking and doing meant property, or
life, or reputation.

  That’s why Tom was on the extra list at
Piermont. with mighty little chance of be-
ing called for anything but the way-freight
on the so-called Scrap-Heap Branch.

   Tom had a girl, or, more correctly speak-
ing, Tom had had a girl. When it was first
made plain to him that there was something
wrong with his sand he had slipped over
to Annie Dupont’s house with his head
down, for a man hates to shame his man-
hood in a girl's eyes.

  “Annie,” said he, “I'm not the man for
you, for you deserve a real man, and the
best part of me is missing. You’ve heard
what happened down on the Canon Curve
yesterday. It’s only by the friendship of
Alf Hardisty that I shall even manage to
drag along on the extra list. I want you
to have your liberty an’ take a better man.”

  “ And not a man in the world is there
with courage like your own,” said Annie,
“ that would come plain and brave in his
shame to a woman. I’m your girl, an’ proud
of my man that takes the shame where there
is no real blame.”

  She washed a way'his trouble with her
tears and cheered him with the sunshine of
her smiles.

  But, after two years, when he had worked
back onto a freight run and it happened
again, Tom wouldn’t kiss the tears away.
He walked off with a face like stone, and
there were two hearts in Piermont that were
as near breaking as brave hearts can be—for
always a brave heart nurses a grain of hope.

  This time Tom had let a string of loads
down the Piermont Mountain so fast that
they came in with every axle-box belching
flames and fumes, and the wheels on the
rails only by the mercy of Providence. Tom
had gone shaky. When he felt them slip-
ping away from him he had made a wild
pull with his left hand instead of with his
right, and the left hand dragged wide open
the closed throttle.

  By the time the fireman got over and
brought him back to earth, Tom had more
momentum on those loads than any straight
air in the world would have held on a four
per cent grade, and they slipped to the bot-
tom like an avalanche, while everything
made for the sidings as fast as steam would
let ’em.

  “What was the trouble, Tom?” asked
Alf Hardisty, the master mechanic.

  “ My air got away from me, Alf. The
pump failed after the first grade.”

  “And then your nerve went wrong?”
suggested Alf.

  Tom nodded, and went on the extra list
for the second time. Evervbodv wondered

342
SHAKY BANKS COMES BACK.

343

why he didn’t resign and try to make a
living as a truck-farmer. Some said it was
because he hadn’t nerve enough to flag an
angleworm. Others said it was because he
had so much nerve he was determined to
make good.

  Then Bob Malloy broke his leg. Bob
made history when he broke his leg, be-
cause Bob handled the fast mail and ex-
press from Piermont to Cardover. It was
just at the period when the Great Southern
had to melt the rails to keep the con-
tract. At length, they’d trimmed it down
so fine that they had Bob hauling three
mail-cars and two Pullmans over one hun-
dred and twenty-nine miles of fair grade,
with three stops, in one hundred and thirty-
five minutes, and it was the general belief
that 110 other engineer on the division could
have done it.

  Well, Bob broke his leg. He broke it
seven minutes before the flier was due.
For two minutes Hardistv racked his brain,
for one minute he swore fluently, and four
minutes before starting-time he sent for
Shaky Banks. There wasn’t anybody else.

  “You have one hundred and thirty-five
minutes to make it in, Tom, and the same
time to bring number ten back. You’re the
one to make ’em if nothing comes up. In
any case, there’ll be a man moved from the
extra list to-morrow—up or off.”

  Alf and Tom had been kids together, but
a master mechanic has a big job to hold
down—and Hardisty was grim.

  Tom nodded. He was grim, too. He
tested his air and his valves, picked up his
signals, slipped over the points, and
streaked down the main line.

  At Pearl City lie was two minutes behind
schedule, having been laid out by a draw.
At Graytown he was five minutes ahead,
and he put in the wait examining the check-
valve, which had not been working as it
should. He fixed the trouble, and pretty
soon they were skimming along on the last
leg of the trip as smoothly as steam ever
moved steel.

  “ I guess we'll make it, Tom,” roared
Walt Sims, the fireman, straightening his
stiff back at the top of the worst grade.

  “ I guess so,” shouted Tom, smiling.

  He cut off the steam and drifted down
with a safe little back pull from the brakes.
In five minutes the worst of the run was
over, and they were scooting through a level
canon whose boulders were washed smooth
ages ago by a mighty river.

  They turned Canon Curve with a little
whistle of the air; and then, like a flash,
Tom pushed the air over to the big hole and
notched the throttle lever up high. They
came to a stop on two running streaks of
sand, five feet from a pile of ties across the
track, backed by a hand-car.

  From behind the hand-car stepped two
masked men.	%

  X)ne walked to the fireman’s side, ancl
the* other to the engineer's. Each of ’em
introduced himself with just one word,
“Up!” It has a peculiar little rising in-
flection, and when it’s set on a hair-trigger
and a forty-five bore it is wisdom to obey
without undue loss of time.

  That is what Tom and his fireman did.
They climbed down on the fireman’s side,
Sims sullen, and Tom—shaking in every
limb.

  They ranged them side by side, while a
third hold-up man went through the Pull-
man.

  “ When Charlie’s rustled the passengers,”
explained one of the train-robbers to the
other, “ we’ll make these fellows cut off the
Pullmans and run the mail-cars a mile or
two up the road. Then we can settle with
the mail-clerks an’ grab the registers with-
out interruption.”

  “ Sure,” answered the other. “ Here
comes Charlie marching the train-crew in
front of him.”

  Tom’s misery was none the less because
his plight seemed unavoidable. He saw his
only chance slipping away after he had
done all that man could do. But the mad-
dening, discouraging part was this unnerv-
ing fear. He wished the men would lower
their guns — those yawning tubes that
seemed gloating over the life they were go-
ing to take. He was sick with dread lest
one of them should go off.

  A cluster of boulders was behind him,
and he ached to steady his limbs by it.
The third man came up. He was evidently
the chief, and a man of a humorous turn.

  “ Hustle, boys! ” lie commanded. “ This
train’s behind schedule already, and we
ought to have some consideration for the
gov’ment mails Rush the eagle eye—why,
just take a look at him! What’s the mat-
ter, Shaky ? ”

  An electric thrill passed through Tom’s
flesh and blood at the insulting name, ac-
cidentally uttered. Like hot wine, his blood
surged from his congested heart and found
his nerves and limbs in one mad rush.
344

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

With a lightning stab, his hand flashed to a
boulder beside him, and with all his enor-
mous strength he bridged the distance to
the bandit with a streak of white. So quick
was the movement, and so fast and true the
throw, that no man thus surprised could
have dodged the missile.

  Three pounds of boulder took the robber
between the eyes.

  Almost before it struck, Tom had leaped.
With a strangling clutch and an irresistible
backward pressure, he snapped the life out
of the first speaker and dropped him to the
ground, to turn on the other man, who was
making a panicky exit from the scene.

  It was a race in which Tom never start-
ed. This was his day for thmklng and
doing the right thing. He dropped to one
knee, wrenched the pistol from the hand of
his second victim, and fired twice. The
first shot missed. The second took the run-
ner just above the shoe, and he dropped.

  “ Come on, boys! ” shouted Tom. “ Rush
these fellows into a car, and let’s get the
track clear. I’ve got seven minutes to

make up in thirty-five miles, an’ I’m in
some hurry.”

  Tom flashed over those thirty-five miles
as if he were going through a fire, and he
was dead on time. He had depopulated the
bandit community. When he reached home
that afternoon most of Piermont was out,
including a brass band and a drum-and-
fife brigade; but you really couldn’t hear
the music. There were only eight moguls
in the yards at the time; but four factory
whistles helped ’em to make a noise.

  Tom looked over the heads of the crowd,
grinning; then he dropped to the ground
and pushed a lane to where two little soft
hands were waiting to fall into his grimy
ones. He held them for a minute of won-
derful tenderness; and then, because he
couldn’t trust himself, he turned laughingly
to answer Alf Hardisty.

  “How about the hoodoo?” asked Alf.

  “ Oh, say,” laughed Tom, “ I've got the
Indian sign on that. When you see Trouble
coming, keep cool, but don’t stop to think
till you’ve slammed him in the slats.”

ROBBED AS HE CALLS FOR HELP.

    HIS is Nolan, operator at Highland. I
am being held up. I was sitting here a
few minutes ago when a young man, wearing a
light overcoat, came in. Had revolver. Held
me up. Said he would kill me if I resisted. He's
holding gun at my head now.”

  This was the message that Despatcher Gleisner,
in the local West Shore terminals, received to-day
as he was sending train-orders.

  “ Go on, I’m listening,” he ticked over the
seventy miles to Highland.

  “He thinks I am sending regular messages,”
Nolan replied. “ Told me to keep right on with
my work. For God’s sake send help.”

  With frantic energy, Gleisner called up the
West Shore offices at Cornwall and Poughkeepsie,
just across the river from Highland. By the time
lie had got‘Nolan on the wire again, police-squads
were forming in both of these places to go to
Nolan's aid.

  “What’s doing now?” Gleisner asked Nolan.
“ He’s still here,” came the reply. “ He has
no idea I called you up.”

  “ I’m sending help," flashed Gleisner.

  “ I’m still at work,” ticked Nolan's key. “ So
is highwayman. Has his gun pointed at me. He
says, ' Keep ^ft-work or I’ll drill you.’ I'm pretty
badly scared. He is now going toward safe.
It is unlocked. Now he opens it. He ransacks
the safe, watching me all the while. He takes out
the money and tickets, putting them in his pocket.
He is walking back toward me. He says: ‘Stay
where you are. If you move in less than five
minutes after I leave here you will be a dead man.’
He backs toward the door.”

  “ Hold him if you can,” urged Gleisner.

  “ I’m trying,” Nolan said. “ I am asking him
to remember that he is losing me my job and am
arguing with him. He says he is sorry. Can’t
hold him any longer. Now he’s gone.”

  Then, at the end of five minutes, Nolan wired:
“ He's gone for good, I guess. I followed him
out, but he got away in the dark.”

  The posse from Cornwall was soon at the
station. They found a white-faced operator and
a safe that had been relieved of one hundred and
seventy dollars, besides several bundles of tickets.

 How I Ran “The General.”

BY WILLIAM J. KNIGHT.

THE TRUE STORY SERIES. The much-mooted question as to
whether the plucky little locomotive which now stands in the Union
Station at Chattanooga, Tennessee, a relic of the Civil War, was ever
known by any name other than that of “ General,” is finally settled herewith.

     The last word comes from Mr. William J. Knight, the engineer who actually
 held the throttle of the pursued locomotive during the wildest and most impor-
 tant race ever run on wheels. Mr. Knight is one of the few surviving veterans
 who took part in the Andrews's raid into the Confederate lines. He has given
 us a railroad man’s version of the famous run, which we hope will clear up any
 doubts which may have been previously held by our readers.

     In a personal letter to the editor of The Railroad Man's Maqazine, Mr.
 Knight states positively that the engine he ran over the rails of the Western
 and Atlantic Railroad from Big Shanty to Ringgold bore the name of “ Gen-
 eral,” and that any other name which has since been applied to it is erroneous.

     The raiders anticipated Sherman by two whole years. Had they been suc-
 • cessful the march to the sea might never have taken place. But they failed, and
 many of them paid the penalty of their daring with their lives.

TRUE STORY, NUMBER FIFTY-FOUR.

Thrilling Experience of a Handful of Federal Soldiers Who Took Part in
the Capture of a Confederate Locomotive, Told by
the Man Who Handled the Throttle.

 It was after dinner, during dress parade,
 when our colonel, after a word with Captain
 L. E. Brewster, stepped up in full view of
 us and said in a tone of command:

“If there is any man in Company E who
knows how to handle a locomotive, let him
step one pace to the front.”

Thinking at the time that some interest-

        WELL remember that day in April,
           1862, when I first learned that
           I was to figure in an expedition
           to capture a Confederate railroad
           train—an expedition which has
           since gone down in history as
           the most thrilling succession of events that
           ever occurred on rails of steel.

ing work might be in store for me, I stepped
forward, and on being told to report at
headquarters immediately after dismissal by
the captain, I resumed my position in the
ranks until drill was. over.

  I was then a private in Company E of
the Twenty - first Ohio Infantry, which,
along with the Thirty-third and Second
Ohio regiments, had encamped at Shelby-
ville, Tennessee, as I was soon to learn, for
the purpose of sending a secret expedition
through the enemy’s lines to tear up the
track and destroy bridges on the Western
and Atlantic Railroad between Chattanooga,
Tennessee, and Atlanta, Georgia.

  Most of the recruits and supplies for the
western wing of the Confederate army were
transported from Atlanta to Chattanooga
over this line, and, therefore, it was the
object of the Federal leader to cripple it and
tie up all traffic as soon as possible.

   At the colonel’s quarters, where I hurried
with Captain Brewster as soon as dress
parade was over, I was introduced to James
J. Andrews, a Kentucky scout, who at once
unfolded to me his daring plan to capture
a train at Big Shanty and run for the Union
lines, leaving a trail of blazing bridges
behind him.

Off for Big Shanty.

  As we stood studying the map the scheme
looked plausible enough. I readily volun-
teered to go and take my chances with the
rest of the boys who had signed up. I was
told to put on citizen’s clothing, with which
I was provided, and be prepared to meet
Andrews and his party just after dark at a
point south of Shelbyville.

  I did as directed. That night twenty-
two of us, in small parties, set out for Chat-
tanooga in the rain. We got through the
Confederate lines easily enough by telling
the pickets we were from Kentucky on our
way to join the Southern army; and arriving
in Chattanooga three days later, we boarded
a train for Marietta, journeying southward
over the road we were planning to cripple.

  We still traveled singly or in groups of
two or three, pretending not to know one
another;, as the cars we rode in were full of
Confederate soldiers, whose suspicions might
easily have been aroused had we appeared
to be too well acquainted.

  The way they talked about being ready
to eat up every “Yank” in the Union made
it hard for us to keep from starting a free-

  for-all fight then and there; but we bided

our time, however, and when we passed Big
Shanty, where we were later to capture our
train, more than one of us turned to pass the
wink to his neighbor.

  We stayed at Marietta that night, and at
five o’clock the next morning, which, as I
remember it, was April 12, 1862, we board-
ed a north-bound train for Big Shanty. We
still traveled in little groups, studiously
avoiding each other, though we knew that
our-time of secrecy was close to an end.

  I sat with several companions near the
front of the car next to the engine, and on
looking around saw that the other members
of our party had all taken seats behind me.
It was not an easy matter to appear uncon-
cerned, knowing that in a few^minutes we
might be called upon to battle for our lives
against heavy odds, for we all felt that, if
caught, we would be treated as spies and
hanged without mercy.

  “ Big Shanty! Twenty minutes for break-
fast!” finally came Conductor Fuller’s call,
and the train soon slowed down and stopped
before a .little one-story station that served
as a ticket office and eating-house for the
trainmen and passengers.

  The moment had arrived for us to put
our daring plan into execution. I say
daring, feeling that I am not overstepping
the bounds of modesty, for at that time
there were Confederate troops camped close
to the station, and picket lines enclosed us
on every side.

  Our party filed out of the car with the
rest of the passengers, but, by a precon-
certed plan, Andrews and I alighted on the
opposite side of the train and made our
way toward the engine, keeping out of sight
as much as possible.

  By the time we had reached the cab we
found that the engineer and fireman had
both gone to their breakfast.

Making a Getaway.

  “We’re lucky they didn’t stop to shake
down their fire and oil around,” said An-
drews, as we crouched beside the tender.
“ It looks as if we can get away without
firing a shot. You run back and uncouple
these forward box cars from the rest of the
train, and we’ll pull out immediately. We
can make better time without the other cars,
and the men can keep out of sight in them
when we run through stations.”

I hastened to obey, and, going back,
HOW I RAN “THE GENERAL.”

pulled out the pin between the third and
fourth cars, so that when we pulled out we
would leave the heavy baggage and passen-
ger coaches standing on the track. A sentry
was pacing up and down the platform with-
in ten feet of where I stood, but I managed
to dodge behind the cars and get back to
where Andrews was waiting without his
seeing me.

  By this time our little party had collected
near the open door of one of the box cars.
At a nod from Andrews, who now leaped
aboard the engine, I followed, while John
and Alf Wilson, who was to sefve as fire-
man, and W. W. Brown, my assistant,
swung on from thfe opposite side.

  The gage showed plenty of pressure, and
a white feather was going up from the steam-
dome.

  “Into your car, men, quick!” called
Andrews. “Let her go, Knight!”

The Throttle Open.

  I jerked open the throttle. We leaped
ahead like a shot. Looking back, I could
see the last man of our party being hauled
head-first into the freight-car, while out of
the station poured a stream of passengers
and trainmen, shouting and waving their
arms in a wild state of excitement.

  We soon disappeared from their sight
around a curve, and ran down the track a
couple of miles. Spying a crowd of section-
men at work ahead of us, Andrews called
out to me:

  “Stop just this side of those fellows!
We'll get their tools and tear up the track,
while Scott cuts the wires! ”

  Andrews had no fear of a message being
sent on ahead from Big Shanty to intercept
us, as there was no operator there; but
feeling that a message might already be
speeding back to Marietta—the nearest tele-
graph office—Andrews thought it wise to
be on the safe side. When we came to a
standstill, Andrews went ahead to where the
gang was working and ordered them to turn
over their tools.

  I could see that there was some argument
at first, but they finally did as directed
without any show of resistance, though they
were probably greatly' puzzled at his com-
mand.

  After a stop of several minutes, during
which the wires were cut and a rail taken
up, we started on again. We were consid-
erably ahead of the regular schedule, so, in

  order to pass a train at Kingston, which we
knew was coming our way, we slowed down
somewhat; but whenever we came in sight
of a station, I would pull her wide open and
go through like the wind.

  It was amusing to see the amazed looks on
the faces of the passengers who stood with
their grips in hand waiting to board our
train, when we shot by at lightning speed.

  Andrews had planned to burn the bridge
over the EtOwa River, but fearing that we
had stopped too long already, we crossed it
and sped on through Etowa, where we
passed a locomotive standing under full
steam on a branch line that ran to an iron-
mine. I suggested to Andrews that we had
better stop and disable this engine in case
we were pursued, but lie refused to do so.
It was there that we made our worst mis-
take, for had we carried away some part of
the mechanism of the old “ Yonah,” Con-
ductor W. A. Fuller and his party could
never have followed us as closely as they did.

  Andrews, unfortunately, did not know
that on that very day General O. M. Mitchell
had captured Huntsville, and instead of
there being only two trains for us to pass, as
we had figured, there were three times as
many, the railroad having started all its
rolling-stock south to prevent its capture by
the Federal troops. We kept on speeding
and loafing until we reached Cass Station.
Noticing a wood-pile and water-tank beside
the track, we stopped and replenished our
fuel and water, as both were beginning to
run low.

  “ I don’t recollect ever seeing you fellows
before,” said the station-agent, whose name
I afterward learned was Russell, when we
climbed down out of the cab.

  “ What have you got in there? ” "he asked,
pointing to the closed box cars.

Powder for Beauregard.

  “You just drop a few sparks from that
pipe of yours inside, and you’ll find out
soon enough,” returned Andrews. “ There’s
powder enough in those cars to blow you
and your station into the middle of next
week! We’re hustling it through to Beau-
regard to shoot holes in Yanks with!”

   “ Oh, that’s your lay, is it? ” said Russell.
“ Hope you get through with it all right.
The Federals ain’t far "off, and if they stop
that peanut-burner of yours, you’re pretty
sure to find out what the inside of a prison
looks like.”

  “ We’re taking our chances,” said I; “ but
I’d hanged sight rather have the ‘Yanks’
get me than run into a head-on with a south-
bound train. We’ve lost our schedule, and
if we don’t get one pretty quick we’re going
to have trouble. Haven’t' you got one we
can have?”

  “ Sure,” said the tank-tender. After
searching his pockets, he finally located a
soiled piece of paper, which he handed to
Andrews.

ordered to keep out of sight until signaled

to come out, Andrews, Wilson, Brown, and
I got down and piled a good supply of wood
on the tender.

  After filling the tank, we pulled on up
the track out of sight, where we stopped,
and while John Scott, who did the wire-
cutting, climbed a telegraph-pole and shut
off telegraphic communication, the rest of
the men, at Andrews’s order, piled railroad-
ties upon the track to obstruct any one who
might follow us.

  Reaching Kingston, Andrews repeated his
tale to the station-agent about carrying
powder tof Beauregard, and gave orders to
the switchman to let us in on the siding to
wait for a south-bound train, which we
knew must pass before we could proceed.

How We Lost an Hour.

  For twenty-five minutes we fumed and
fretted, watching the southern horizon for
the smoke of a pursuing locomotive. When
the train from the north finally hove in
sight and pulled up beside us, our hopes
took another drop, for there on the last car
flag-signals were flying to show that another
train was following.

  We waited for over an hour while two
more trains pulled by before we were finally
given a clear track to Adairsville, and there
was a general sigh of relief when we pulled
out on the main line.

  A short distance north of Kingston, we
stopped to block the track again and take on
a load of railroad-ties. Some of the men
smashed a hole in the end of the rear car,
and when we got under headway again,
they dropped the heavy timbers one by one
upon the track behind us.

  The outlook now seemed considerably
brighter, and our spirits rose perceptibly.
Had we known then, however, that only a
few minutes behind us, tearing along the
rails, was an engine bearing Captain Fuller
and a corps of Confederate soldiers armed
with rifles, against which our short-range
pistols were useless, we would not have felt
so cheerful.

  About four miles from Adairsville, at
Andrews’s order, we stopped again. Some
of the men went back and tore up one rail.
While the work of track-destruction was go-
ing on, those of us in the engine kept watch
and strained our ears for sounds of pursuit,
when suddenly we were filled with alarm
by a low whistle coming faintly to us down
tlie track.
HOW I RAN “THE GENERAL.”

  “ Every man back to the train. They’re
after us!” yelled Andrews to the workers,
who were busily battering out spikes and
bending the rails. There was a wild scram-
ble for the box cars, and as soon as every
one was aboard, I opened her up and we
sped on toward Adairsville.

Tied Up Again.

  A freight-train, with signals showing an-
other train behind it, was standing on the
main line when we pulled up to the station,
so we took the siding and waited with our
hearts in our throats for the second section
to arrive.

  Fortunately for us, it was not long in
putting in an appearance, but, on arrival, it
stopped directly across the switch over which
we must pass to enter the main line again.

  Andrews hurried over to the conductor
and asked him to pull up and let us by, but
he refused, insisting that if we proceeded
we were in danger of colliding with another
train which was following, and which he
was sure had already left Calhoun, the sta-
tion ahead of us.

  Andrews had it hot and heavy with this
man for some time, but on promising to send
a flagman ahead at every curve, the con-
ductor finally consented to let us move on
without our having to use force.

  As soon as his last car had left the switch,
Andrews pulled it open and swung aboard
as we dashed out onto the main line.

  “ Keep her hot, boys! ” he yelled to Brown
and Wilson, who were hard at work heaving
the heavy cordwood into the fire-box.

  “ Give her every ounce she’s got,
Knight!” he shouted, raising his voice
above the barking of the exhaust and the
roar of the wheels. “ Death in a wreck is
better than hanging! There’s no time for
a flagman now! ”

  We took one curve after another at top
speed, ready for the worst, until we would
gain a clear stretch of track and get a
glimpse far enough ahead to see that we
were not running into a head-on smash.

Courting a Collision.

  Behind us, the men in the box cars were
tossed about from side to side, momentarily
expecting to leave the track and be hurled
to destruction when we went into the ditch.
Had we been but a few moments later, a
wreck would surely have occurred. As it

was, we pulled into Calhoun just in time
to see the passenger-train for which we had
so long been straining our eyes pulling out
of the station toward us.

  As soon as the engineer saw us he started
back toward the depot, but when he per-
ceived that we were slowing down, he stopped
with his pilot-trucks on the frogs of the
switch which opened into the siding, block-
ing the rails so that we could not get by.

  Andrews repeated his powder story, but
the conductor and engineer were both so
angry at him for taking chances of a col-
350

lision that they refused to listen and would
not budge an inch.

   It looked for a few minutes as if Andrews
would have to call out his men and move
the train out of the way himself, but his
demands were so positive that the conductor
finally yielded and told his engineer to back
off the switch far enough to let us by.

  We now felt that if we could get to the
Oostanaula bridge in time to destroy it the
race would be won. More wires would
then be cut, and other bridges burned with-
out fear of pursuit, for we knew that Gen-
eral Mitchell was close to Chattanooga, and
were sure that we could easily make our
way to his forces.

  As we had made the nine miles from
Adairsville to Calhoun in seven and a half
minutes, we felt that we had now gained
enough headway on our pursuers to stop
and cut wires and tear up the track. Scott
was soon at the top of one of the telegraph-
poles, sending the wires whipping down to
the ground, while Andrews and the rest of
the men began taking off fishplates and
pulling out spikes.

How Fuller Followed.

  They had not been long at work, how-
ever, when around a curve, only a few miles
down the track, I suddenly sighted the
smoke of a locomotive.

  It was running toward us at full speed.
I yelled to Andrews that we must be on our
way.

  Some of the men had pried loose the end
of a rail, and in their haste were stumbling
about, dropping their tools and getting in
each other’s way.

  “ Give me that bar, and all of you get
aboard! ” yelled Andrews, snatching a crow-
bar from one of the men.

  While the rest of the party scrambled
back into their “ side-door Pullmans,” An-
drews struggled and wrenched at the un-
wieldy rail, seeking vainly to bend it out of
place and tear it from the ties.

  Then, seeing that the locomotive was
almost upon him, he dropped the bar. Giv-
ing me the signal to go ahead, he sprang
for the hand-rail and swung himself aboard
the last car.

  With the fire flying from her drivers, I
gave the “ General ” every ounce of steam
in her boilers, and we tore ahead. I glanced
backward from time to time to make sure
that we were keeping out of rifle-range.

  It seems that as soon as we pulled out of
Big Shanty—as I afterward, learned from
reports and from Conductor William Fuller
himself, when we met at a soldiers’ reunion
at Columbus, Ohio, after the war—he and
his engineer, Jeff Cain, together with An-
thony Murphy, then foreman of the Western
and Atlantic Railroad shops, had started
out after us on foot.

  They ran until they met the section-gang
whose tools we had taken, and securing a
hand-car from them, they hurried on after
us until they reached Etowa, where they
boarded the “ Yonah ” and continued the
pursuit. They had no trouble in passing
the break in the rails beyond Cass Station
with the hand-car, as they had rolled it
over the ties and soon had it on the track
again.

  At Kingston, being unable to get by the
two freight-trains which we had passed
there, Fuller and his party ran around them
on foot and, boarding the engine “Rome,”
which was standing on a side-track, started
on again. As we had not stopped long
enough to destroy the track again until near
Adairsville, Fuller, who had now been
joined by a number of Confederates, had lit-
tle trouble in getting that far with the
“Rome.” Here he abandoned the “Yo-
nah,” and "'a little farther on, meeting an-
other train we had passed, he made the crew
back with him into Adairsville, where he
secured an engine called the “ Texas,” and
again started on our trail, catching his first
glimpse of us when we stopped just north of
Calhoun.

  We soon lost sight of our pursuers, but,
knowing that they were still only a few
minutes behind us, we could readily see
that if we delayed at any of the stations
ahead we would be caught like rats in a
trap.

  Too closely followed to stop at Oostanaula
bridge, which we had planned to fire, we
sped on, dropping ties on the track behind
us, but we were now going so fast that most
of them bounded off when striking the
ground, and impeded the progress of the
“Texas” but little.

Fighting with Freight-Cars.

  Every time we reached the end of a
straight piece of track, we could see the
Confederate engine tearing after us. Reach-
ing the top of an incline near Resaca,
we uncoupled our last car, and I reversed
HOW I RAN “THE GENERAL.

351

and shot it down toward them. Engineer
Bracken, however, also reversed and caught
the car without its doing any damage to the
“Texas.” Then, pushing it ahead of them,
they came on after us.

  Again we repeated our tactics, but they
again caught the empty car, side-tracking
the two at Resaca, through which we ran at
lightning speed. Their delay gave us a
little more headway, and a few miles out
of town we dared stop long enough to cut
the wires again, fearing that if Fuller could
manage to send a message on ahead of us,
some station-agent would side-track us.

  Not having time enough to tear up the
track when we stopped for wood near Til-
ton, six miles north of Resaca, the men
placed the rail, which we had carried with
us from near Cass Station, diagonally across
the track, wedging one end of it tightly.

  The engineer of the “Texas” sighted it
in time, and stopped his locomotive.

  The other side of Tilton, through which
we passed in safety, we filled our tank and
took on more wood, while some of the men
went back a short distance and obstructed
the track to insure another full stop of the
“Texas” out of gunshot range.

  As often as we dared to stop, the men
got off and cut wires and blocked the track,
but not once did they more than get started
to remove a rail before the roar of the
“Texas” speeding toward us would reach
our ears, and we would have to dart on at
full speed. Once we halted in full view of
a regiment of Confederate soldiers, but not
long enough to give them a chance to come
after us. We were constantly in sight of
Captain Fuller’s party now, and some of
them tried to pick us off with their rifles.

  In spite of the closeness with~which our
enemies hung upon our heels, however,

HE WAS A

SEVERAL months ago an old railroad man out
in Seattle was caught between the bumpers
of two box cars. He didn't have many friends
and none of them did anything for him. He
went to a hospital. It took his last dollar to save
his left leg, but he-Was hopelessly crippled.
Turned out of the hospital, broke and discour-
aged, the old man could not find employment.

  He sought relief in the courts. After a hard-
fought legal battle, the old man was awarded
$1,700. He didn't get all of this. His attorney
had to have his fee. But what little he did have,
the old man put into the Illinois lodging-house.
He couldn't make it go.

Andrews had not given up hope of accom-
plishing the work he had set out to do, and
was still intent upon burning the first
Chickamauga bridge, twelve miles north of
Dalton, though Fuller was quite determined
that he should not.

  On we sped, through the tunnel at Tunnel
Hill, where I begged Andrews to abandon
the engine, arid either turn it loose back
through the tunnel toward the “Texas,” or
send it on ahead for Fuller to follow. He
would agree to neither plan, however, but
ordered the men to set their one remaining
car on fire and come aboard the engine.
This they did, pouring oil upon its walls
and floors, and we left it blazing_on the
middle of Chickamauga bridge.

  But again luck was against us. It had
been raining, and the fire burned so slowly
that by the time Fuller arrived on the scene
the bridge had not yet caught. He had no
trouble in pushing the blazing car ahead
of him to Ringgold, where he side-tracked
it. Here the alarm was given to the local
militia, some of whom boarded the “Texas,”
when it again started after us.

  There is little more to tell. Wilson had
thrown the last stick of wood into the fire,
and the water was not showing in the gage.
Soon we were only running twenty-five miles
an hour, then twenty, then fifteen, and then
came Andrews’s command':

  “ Stop her, Knight! Scatter, boys! It’s
every man for himself now! ”

  History has recorded the rest. We were
all taken captive in the woods by the Con-
federate soldiers, not far from where we
abandoned the “ General.”

  I	was one of the eight who escaped from
Atlanta Prison. Eight others, including
Andrews, were hanged -as spies, and the
remaining six were exchanged.

CRIPPLE.

  He was a railroad man, a maimed, useless rail-
road man, who didn't know anything about leases,
rents, and law papers. He lost his place.

  He saved a few dollars from the wreck, how-
ever, and said he would start afresh. Two months
ago he leased a dingy little rooming-house. The
boarders wouldn't come. The old man's dollars
slipped away one by one, but he saved enough to
end the hopeless fight of a railroad man who was
useless and friendless.

  The record at the city morgue reads as follows:

committed suicide by taking carbolic acid. He
was a cripple.”—Exchange.
FATE JOHNSON’S FINANCIERING

J* WHAT DO I DRAW
NEXT ? "

          , ATE JOHNSON, hobo, com-
            pleted his seventeenth somer-
            sault head downward in the
            mud against the barb-wire
            fence. He reversed himself,
            clawed the Nebraska soil
            from his face and looked about him in the
            dark. The Chicago Flier was in the ditch..

  Fate glanced over the wreck with a sort
of proprietary solicitude for the particular
Pullman from the roof of which he had just
alighted. It lay on its side crossways of the
track.

  “ Hit something,” remarked Fate as he
leaned against the fence and felt in his
pockets for the makings of a cigarette. The
wreck was in an uproar, but Fate, having
little use for uproars from long experience,
struck a match, shielded it from the stiff
night breeze and puffed carefully.

  The flare of the match showed him some-
thing caught on the fence-wires near him.
Fate moved along the fence to investigate.

BY SUMNER LUCAS.

An Episode in Frenzied Banking That
Isn’t Quite So Impossible as It Sounds.

 To a hobo who has nothing, and
everything to gain, Fate knew that
he had added to his cipher of
wealth. Gathering in the bundle,
Fate started to circle the wreck and
go down the tracks on foot, a thing
sorely against his professional pride;
but it was dark, and the wreck
might be accepted as an extenuating
circumstance.

   Before he hit the rails he stumbled
over another bundle. Picking up
this one, he began to count the ties
to the east. Fate had no particular
destination except to get out of Ne-
braska. It was harvest - time, and
work was too plentiful and insistent
for Fate’s daily comfort. A mile
down the track he saw a dim straw-
stack off to the left, and he turned
toward it.

   “ Burning some,” he said to himself as he
glanced back at the glare of the wreck.
Stowing his bundles away, he “ hit the hay.”
In two minutes he was sound asleep.

  Just at daylight the wrecker tearing by
awoke him.

   “Late,” commented Fate to its ponder-
ous crane. Then he stretched himself and
in the gathering light proceeded to examine
his newly acquired possessions. He un-
wrapped the first one and stopped to scratch
his head.

  “Baby boy! Seems I’m elected a per-
ambulating orphan asylum,” he grunted, as
he looked at the unconscious infant. “ What
do I draw next—house and lot and mother-
in-law ? ” he continued.

  The next was one of the hammocks used
in the lower berths of a Pullman to hold the
sleeper’s clothing. It contained a full out-
fit of expensive clothing, black frock coat,
pearl-gray trousers, patent-leather shoes;
with shirt, tie, soft hat, and other things to

 match; also a small hand-grip "containing a
 lady’s toilet articles.

   “Ah!” cooed Fate as from" the ' inside
pocket of the carefully folded vest he pulled
a long seal - leather pocketbook. “ Let's
see who I am, ‘ The Honorable Boyd Hill
'Kingston.’ And five hundred to the good
in long-green, yellow-back fifties—and a
draft on New York for—suffering Je-hos-
safat! one hundred thousand dollars!”
There were other papers that Fate John-
son, hobo, seated there by the stunned baby,
examined with interest.

   “ Time to move, kid,” he smiled. He pro-
 ceeded to wash the mud from his face in
 the puddle formed by the night’s rain and
 to array himself in his new clothes.

   “Good fit,” commented Fate as he looked
 himself over critically.

   Picking up his other bundle gingerly,
Fate, in all his glory, started for a town he
could see some three miles to the south. To
get to it he had to cross the track, which he
did with his usual modesty by means of a
gully and a culvert.

   There was high scandal and various
speculations in that town that day and for
some days to come—in fact, it never quite
died out—when an infant dressed in dainty
clothing with but one blue leather shoe
was found on the doorstep of the Bachelors’
Club. The doorway looked prosperous to
Fate, and he wanted to do the best he could
for the boy.

   Babies were one of the few things that
had. not come within the rather extended
experiences of Fate Johnson.

   Now, good-by to Fate Johnson, hobo;
enter the alias, Hon. Boyd Hill Kingston,
banker.

   Traffic Center is a city somewhere be-
tween Chicago and St. Louis. That eve-
ning a rather gaunt gentleman in black
frock coat, pearl-gray trousers, with a clean
shave and otherwise adorned, and with his
right hand bandaged in black silk, leaned
over the register of the Palace Hotel, laid
down a card and said just six words:

   “ Register me. Hand hurt. Dinner on ? ”

   Ignoring the over-friendly inquiries of
 the bland clerk, Fate, with just a suspicion
 of haste, entered the brilliant dining-room,
 while the clerk wrote on the register, “ Boyd
 Hill Kingston, San Francisco,” and as-
 signed him to the best suite in the house.

   Later, the head waiter noted that Mr.
Kingston had given the largest tip of the
evening and had also ordered and eaten a

     11	R R

most elaborate dinner. The news spread—
as only such news does—through the hotel,
and the gentleman was rated accordingly.

  Nor were they surprised next day to learn
that the silent gentleman had bought the
controlling interest in the private banking-
house of “ Davenport & Co.” The price
was said to be one hundred thousand dollars,
on which he held an option.

  But surprise did come when they learned
the next evening that the generous gentle-
man had also acquired the controlling
ownership of the State Bank, whose capital
was five hundred thousand dollars with de-
posits of over two millions.

  Surprise grew to utter amazement and the
talk of the town, when, within three days,
this self-same gentleman had literally
bought every bank in the city. There was
much talk in the papers of “ the representa-
tive of Western capital, himself immensely
wealthy, who has cornered the banking busi-
ness of Traffic Center.” The papers spoke

"time to MOVE, KID."
354

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

with something like awe mingled with en-
thusiasm of his “ breezy Western way of
doing business, the ‘ take-it-or-leave-it, yes
or no ’ methods so characteristic of life in
San Francisco.”

  Then came the earthquake. But to all
inquiries the gentleman was equally taci-
turn. He gave but one interview, which
was spread over the front pages of the fol-
lowing Sunday papers, thus: “Sold out.
Bought here.”

  Fate was having the time of his life.
There had been a fierce business-war on in
Traffic Center for two years which focused
in the two big banks, the First National and
the Second National. The first morning in
town, Fate had walked into the banking-
house of “Davenport & Co.,” wasted no
words, identified himself with certain pa-
pers, laid down his option on the bank’s
stock with a draft on New York for one
hundred thousand dollars, and had taken
immediate possession.

  He signed all papers by merely touch-
ing the pen with his injured hand while
another guided it. From “Davenport &
Co.,’' where he was now czar, Fate had be-
gun to make those financial moves that
awoke the town. His fame spread by wire
to all financial centers, and especially to
Chicago. From “Davenport & Co..” he
had walked into the State Bank, right into
the president’s private office and announced
himself with:

  “You own this bank?”

  “Well—er—yes. Why? Whom have I
the pleasure of addressing ? ”

   “ Control ? ”

   “Yes, sir.”

  “How much?”

  “ Well, er—really, my dear sir. I hadn’t
thought exactly of selling. Have you an
offer to make ? ”

  “Half million.”

  The president and principal owner of the
State Bank had considered a moment. Here
was an offer really above the value of the
bank, and a good chance to get out of the
bitter fight then raging at its worst, and to
get out with profit.

   “ I'll take it.” lie said.

  “ Immediate possession,” said Fate as he
wrote a cashier's check on “ Davenport Sc
Co.,” for nearly' all the cash on deposit in
that old and staid institution.

  In an hour the deal was closed and Fate
reigned supreme in the State Bank as in
“ Davenport & Co.”

  With two million of deposit, over half in
cash on hand, Fate then moved on the First
National. He bought a fift\>-five per cent
ownership in the First next day. paying for
it out of the vaults of the State Bank.

  With the First, he now had over five mil-
lions at his command, and with this he
bought the Second National for a million
cash outright.

  “Endless chain,” remarked Fate, as he
went to his bed Saturday night—the night
of the fourth day'.

  Fate Johnson, hobo, now controlled
something like ten million dollars, over one-
third of it in cash, and owned all the banks
in the 'city of Traffic Center. That ended
the long and disastrous financial war.

  Monday morning the news that the
financial war was over in Traffic Center
was known and approved in all the big
financial centers of-America. When Fate
—beg pardon! the Hon. Boyd Hill Kings-
ton; and Fate was very particular about
this—when he was asked what his plans
were, he replied in a word and a half:

  “ Consolidated.”

  He did so that day. Certain papers
which should have gone to Washington
Fate put in his pocket.

  “ Less trouble,” was his verdict, after an
hour’s study.

  The ending of the financial fight had a
wonderful effect on the business of Traffic
Center. Real estate rose from ten to twen-
ty-five per cent. Business blocks, the leases
for which had stood trembling on the out-
come of the war, were promptly rented at
a sharp advance. The nail factory reopened
with a pay-roll of eight hundred men.

  Fate loaned the flour mills fifty thousand
dollars, and their doors opened to eleven
hundred employees. Merchants wired -for
bills of goods held in abeyance, and doubled
others. The huge Lake National Bank of
Chicago closed a deal with the new “ Con-
solidated Bank”—otherwise with Fate
Johnson, hobo—and put two millions on
deposit. Fate made loans freely, but al-
ways through his cashiers. The big man
must not be disturbed with details

  Naturally he became a target for char-
ity beggars. To all he gave a silent frown,
and turned away—all except one. When
the Rev. Mr. Huntington mentioned “or-
phans,” Fate jerked out:

  “What’s that?”

  “ We have one hundred thousand dollars
pledged by Mr. Gotrox, of New York, for
FATE JOHNSON’S FINANCIERING.

an orphan asylum in Traffic Center, if we
can raise another hundred thousand. We
have fifty thousand already raised in cash
her and the Gotrox money is in a New
York bank ready for us the moment we
can show our hundred thousand in cash
here. But the time is up at noon to-day—
and it is now eleven o’clock, Mr. Kings-
ton—”

  “All right,” said Fate Johnson, hobo.

  That settled the matter. The Gotrox
money was forwarded by wire at Fate’s
expense, the “Kingston Junior Orphan
Asylum Association ” was organized, a site
was bought for ninety thousand cash—
which Fate generously gave as an after-
thought—and the whole matter settled and
under way within twenty-four hours.

  Next day the babies began to come—first
one, then by dozens. Fate paid the bills.

  The four banks which Fate had cornered
held between them over one million in fore-
closed real estate. The sudden revival of
business and confidence, supported by re-
ports of niore millions yet to come, the oil-
ing of the wheels of trade, and the new
steam put into every line, enabled the banks
to sell their heretofore dead real estate and
mortgages at a boom profit of nearly half a
million dollars.

  There were some croakers in town, but
these timid and suspicious gentry with too
many questions to ask were promptly
frowned down as enemies to the prosperity
which had struck Traffic Center.

  On the tenth day Fate Johnson, hobo,
millionaire, and benefactor of Traffic City,
was calmly eating his dinner, when an ex-
cited gentleman, followed by the chief of
police and a patrol-wagon full of club-
swingers, rushed through the stately portals
of the Palace Hotel. All doors were in-
stantly guarded. A frontal attack was
made on the dining-room. Fate looked up,
and calmly went on eating-

  “That’s him! He’s the scoundrel—thief
—forger! That’s him! ” yelled the one and
only original Hon. Boyd Hill Kingston.

  Fate helped himself to the peas.

  The chief of police stopped and looked at
him in admiration.

  “Say, you! You’re wanted!” he man-
aged to blurt out, a trifle disconcerted, and
doubting which really was Kingston.

  “Me?" calmly inquired Fate.

  “ Yes, you! ” growled the chief.

  “Guilty’,” murmured Fate as he finished
his champagne and arose.

  They locked him up—and there was ex-
citement in Traffic Center.

   It took a meeting of all Traffic Center’s
bankers, lawyers, and business men to save
the town. The huge Lake National Bank
in Chicago rushed a man on a special train
with a million in cash.

  But the mess was not so bad. The Hon.
Boyd Hill Kingston was a shrewd thinker.

HE WANTED TO DO THE BEST HE COULD
FOR THE BOY.

He saw his chance. He promptly author-
ized all that Fate Johnson had done. But
just what on the whole had he done? Who
was he? No one knew, and all hastened
to the jail. Mrs. Kingston went with them
out of curiosity.

  They found Fate asleep.

  He rolled over on his iron cot, sat up,
and surveyed his callers sleepily.

  “ Whoever you are,” began Kingston,
“you're a daisy. You’ve raised Cain
What did you do it for? You’ve signed and
uttered enough forgeries to put yourself in
the ‘ pen ’ till the sun cools. Tell us about
it, won’t you? ”

  “Talk! ” thundered the chief.

   Fate scratched his chin.
356

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

  “Where’ve you been?” he finally asked.
“Me?” gasped Kingston. “I was hurt
in a wreck in Nebraska. Been in the hos-
pital with concussion of brain. My wife
and I—er—our baby was burned there; and
I thought my clothes and papers were.”
“’Tain’t burned,” soliloquized Fate, re-
garding a crack in the floor.

  “'Tain’t burned!” shrieked
Mrs. Kingston. “Where is he?

Where is my baby? ”

  Fate fished into his pocket—
the police had overlooked it,
and the chief frowned — and
drew out a baby’s shoe of blue
leather.

let me out — and stand for that orphan
asylum, and I’ll tell w’ere your kid is.”
“Yes—yes!” urged Mrs. Kingston.

  “ Yes,” echoed Kingston.

   “ Yes,” growled the chief.

  “Yes,” echoed the lawyers.

Fate took it, read it, and hand-

“yes, you!” growled the chief.

  “This its shoe?” he asked.

  “ Yes—yes! Where is he — where is

on the cement floor and reaching her arms

HEAT VALUE OF GOAL.

IT is interesting to note the heat value of coal in
comparison with other fuels. The variation
in coal samples, however, makes it impossible to
fix an exact standard. The conclusions recently
arrived at by the Unite'd States Geological Survey
are based upon what is known as pure coal, or
actual coal, or unil coal, meaning the actual or-
ganic matter which is involved in combustion,

apart from other extraneous mineral matter. The
following table furnishes a near approach to the
relative values of the most common fuels: Bitu-
minous coal, Easter field, 150 to 160; anthracite,
150 lo 155; bituminous. Mid-Continental field, 142
to 150; lignite, black. 125 to 135; lignite, brown.
115 to 125; peat, 78 to 115; cellulose and wood,

Queer Railroads I Have Known.

BY STEPHEN CHALMERS.

IN the January number of The Railroad Man's Magazine, Charles Fred-
erick Carter told about some antiquated steam roads on which he traveled
during a recent journey in Europe, but it seems that you don’t have to
cross the Atlantic to make a study of old-fashioned railroads. South America
and the West Indies are full of them. Roads that look as if they might have
been built before the Flood are operated on the same principle as old horse-
car lines.	_

    Mr. Chalmers's experiences in the rickety coaches of slow-moving trains
run by engineers who played checkers and pulled the “ leber ” ought to be
something to make calamity howlers, knockers, and railroad jokers who scorn
the excellent service they receive in this country, sit up and take notice.

Trains on a Certain Central American Railroad, Only Forty-Seven Miles
Long, Are Frequently Two Hours Late. Humorous
Customs of Jamaican Trainmen.

     The main good thing about this railway
  is that it saves you walking up a half-mile
  pier to the baked, waterless, iceless, lizard-
  inhabited scattering of tin-roofed human
  furnaces that is mapped as Savanilla, alias
  Puerto Colombia. The pier was built by
  the steamship companies, which is too bad,
  for one would have liked to credit the rail-
  way itself with one redeeming feature.

Making a Start.

     The train loads at the head of the pier.
  It is made up of three or four obsolete com-
  partment-cars with wooden seats and stiff,
  rusted, squeaky windows that you may raise
  and bake or leave down and choke from
  soft-coal cinders—just as you see fit.

       N criticizing railways, one can
          generally command a sympa-
          thetic audience. The railway
          joke is as old as—railways. It
          began with the first loud guf-
          faw when Robert Stephenson
          ran his “ Puffing Billy.”

  In England, the London and South-
western is the butt of the railway joke as
the Erie is here. I have traveled on both the
Erie and the L. & S. W., and I fail to see
anything seriously the matter with'"either
of them. In fact, I make bold to state that,
because of the joke that shadows the es-
cutcheon of these roads, each is particularly
painstaking and courteous in its service.

  There are some railways in this world
alongside which either the Erie or the Lon-
don and Southwestern would look like the
king's snecial on coronation day.
358

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

   One day I sat stewing in one of the crazy
wooden compartments, waiting for that train
to start from Savanilla for Barranquilla.
The depot was an oblong of cement paving
—quite warm in the tropics—shaded by a
red-painted galvanized-iron roof. When
the sun beats on that roof and the iron be-
comes almost red-hot, the shade it gives is
something like that suggested by Dante’s
Inferno.

  Nevertheless, there seemed to be some
people who actually enjoyed it. I remember
there were several Syrian pack-pedlers who
were too wise to climb aboard that train
before starting-time was announced. They
sat on a bench under the galvanized-iron
roof and dozed away the happy hours of
waiting in company with other slumberers.

  I have wondered since if by any chance
these people were not really overpowered
by the heat, for when—at the end of time—
the conductor yelled out in Spanish that all
was ready for the start, he found it neces-
sary to awake them and ask if they were
planning to travel by his train.

  Even after everybody was aboard, there
was some delay occasioned by the fact that
the stoker and the engineer were in the
middle of an interesting game of checkers
on the iron step of the locomotive. This
may sound unconvincing. But the reader
is assured by an eye-witness that it is not
even exaggerated.

   When the train at last started, it was as
if some prehistoric monster that has been
asleep for an eon of years awakes and
limbers up its stiff joints. What snortings,
creakings, groanings, hissings, and nerve-
ripping flange shrieks came from that loco-
motive before it got under way!

   The agonies of that ride up the valley,
rumbling around uneven curves, laboriously
toiling up steep grades and seeming to
tumble, rather than roll, down dips, with
the sun blazing in at one window this minute
and glaring in at the other the next, as the
train twisted, are too painful for detailed
description in a world that is already full
of sorrow and discomfort.

Zigzagging Up the Grade.

   Of course, one associates this sort of hu-
mor with all things Latin-American. While
admitting that this Colombian railroad was
as much opera bouffe as anything I ever
read in a South American revolutionary
novel, I must also admit that in South

America I found, if not the best managed
road, at least one that holds the palm for
scenic charm.

  I have never been on the Trans-Andean,
and the Guayaquil to Quito road was not
completed when I was in that region, but
it would be hard to beat the magnificence
of the zigzag from La Guayra to Caracas
in Venezuela.

  When you come out of your ship’s cabin
in the dawn, as I did once in La Guayra
harbor, and stare up at the mountains which
rise abruptly from the water’s edge to a
height of between seven and ten thousand
feet, it is difficult enough to conceive how
the town of La Guayra manages to stick on
without being prepared to believe that a
railway goes up the face of that stupendous
mountain range.

Over the Panama Road.

   Yet it is the truth, and it is also one of
the greatest engineering feats ever performed
in railway construction. I am not pre-
pared to state what the rise per mile is on
this single track, but supposing the height
to be climbed is six thousand feet at least,
and it takes at least two hours to get away
with that six thousand feet, you have some
idea of what the builders of that road had
to contend with.

  Starting from the depot at La Guayra,
the train runs along the shore for a couple
of miles to the west. Then the road and
the train begin to climb. The face of the
mountain is so precipitous that the track is
one long zigzag all the time. Here one can
literally speak of the engine turning around
and meeting its own tail-end going in an
opposite direction.

  As the zigzag eats up the heights, a
panorama unravels itself that staggers de-
scription. The mountain falls right from
the wheels of the train into the sea thousands
of feet below, and one’s scalp creeps over
the possibility of the train falling with it.
The sea spreads like a blue cloth spotted
with little ships and tufts of green and
rocky headlands, and the view grows as the
train climbs higher and higher.

  When the shoulder of the mountain is
reached, the locomotive’s Herculean task is
done, and presently the train rattles merrily
down into an amphitheater of hills, in the
hollow of which lies Caracas—the Paris of
South America.

Most people will be interested in the Pan-
QUEER RAILROADS I HAVE KNOWN.

ama Railroad, which for years controlled
the Isthmus—and the canal for that matter
—running a steamer service, in conjunction,
between San Francisco and Panama and
from the other terminus, Colon, to New
York.

  This bit of railroad is only forty-seven
niles long, and it has a stop about every
three miles. What with stops and starts,
delays and shunting among dirt-trains, etc.,
the passenger-train, which is supposed to
make the forty-seven-mile trip in two hours,
is sometimes two hours late.

  Ever since the American entered the zone,
the Panama Railroad is getting quite smart.
The stops are as numerous as ever. There
is Monkey Hill and Bohio and Frijoles
(beans), and a host of others with pic-
turesque names. The cars are as uncom-
fortable as ever, and no doubt the atmos-
phere is as redolent of patchouli and pink
powder, than which the half-Spanish wom-
en love nothing better on special occasions—•
like traveling on the Panama Railroad.

Comic Elements of Jamaica.

  The road runs almost parallel with the
“ ditch ” ; and as compensation for many
discomforts one may catch an occasional
glimpse of the canal with Uncle Sam’s
steam-shovels biting up the dirt and spitting
it out again into trucks on a narrow-gage
road.

  A sad aspect of travel on this road, how-
ever, is the sight, all along the route, of
abandoned locomotives, derricks, trucks,
etc. When the French company went to
smash and the famous Panama scandal
raised its head, the works were abandoned
as monuments for the scores of Frenchmen
who were buried in yellow-fever graves.

  One of the saddest sights I ever saw—-
impressive in its suggestion of fallen power
—was a locomotive toppled over on its side
by the old canal, rusted and twined with
weeds that blossomed out of its funnel,
where, I have no doubt, the birds had built
nests year after year.

  One would think that getting as near
the United States as the Island of Jamaica
one would fail to find any of the comic
elements of primitive railroads. Yet I do
not think I have ever had funnier railroad
experiences than in Jamaica.

  The Jamaica railroad is a fine piece of
engineering. It runs from Kingston to
Spanish Town at the base of the interior

mountains, where it branches off into two
arms, one running diagonally across the
island to Montengo Bay in the northwest
of the island, the other running similarly
to Port Antonio in the northeast corner.

  From the Port Antonio branch there is
a little fork that rims to a place called
Ewarton. It goes no further, for frowning
Mount Diablo is there to defy, if not the
engineer who built the road, at least the
poorly lined pocket of the Jamaica govern-
ment.

  The Jamaica Railway was first run by
an American company, under lease from the
government. No doubt, the American com-
pany made money out of it and had no in-
tention of doing anything else. Certain it
is that the government was dissatisfied with
something and the lease was not renewed.
It then became the Jamaica Government
Railway, and, as such, is no better than it
was under the American company.

  The officials, with the exception of a few
who are high in office, are all negroes. The
locomotive engineer is black beneath his
soot, and the stoker need not burrow in the
coal to disguise his race. The conductors
are negroes and their efforts to carry them-
selves with fitting dignity are sometimes
uproariously amusing to American tourists.

  “ Dis way foh de Poht Antony train. Be
pleased to move swiftly, kind ladies. De
train am about to staht! ”

  Between two stations on the Port Antonio
line there are eleven tunnels through a very
mountainous region. As at Savanilla, the
cars are mostly of the compartment, wooden-
box order, with windows that refuse to be
closed when it so happens that you do not
chose to leave them wide open.

When Sam Pulled the “ Leber.”

  Before entering the first of the eleven
tunnels you chose your own fate, either to
be baked in an oven or asphyxiated with
soft-coal smoke and cinders. Most people
leave the windows open, with the result diat
they gasp for breath as they come out of
one tunnel and, before the air is cleared
of smoke, they are choking in the sooty
blackness of another.

  There are eleven tunnels in quick suc-
cession.

  After the tribulations of the tunnels, the
engineer likes to make some speed going
down hill. One Sunday afternoon the train
was late. The driver opened the throttle.
360

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

For twenty minutes that train fairly7
streaked down a gorge and spun around
curves on two wheels, as it seemed.

  The conductor, an amiable black with
two front teeth missing, was walking along
the footboard collecting tickets. The sway-
ing and rolling and lurching of the train
seemed to delight his play-loving soul. As
he took my ticket, his feelings overcame
him. He emitted a whoop and yelled:

  “ Open de leber, Sam! Open de leber! ”
Sam did. I found my'self holding on to
my seat, wondering if again, as once before,
the train was to miss points, bang into a
train-load of bananas and precipitate me
into the vest of a stout member of the Ja-
maica legislature.

  Oddly enough, this incident happened
near a grade where, years before, the coup-
lings broke between the cars of a heavily
laden train.

  But the comedy of this railway exceeds its
tragedy. I will never forget once during
the rainy season when, having been penned
up in a house in the mountains, I tried to
reach Kingston. Allowing for a number
of washouts, I made fairly good time as far
as Spanish Town, where the trains of the
other two branches were hitched on behind.
Then the big train with the second-hand
dromedary engine started across the swamps
to Kingston.

  This swamp used to be a lagoon. It
was a splendid place for ducks but an awful
place for a train during the wet season.
Out of the morass the sunken waters seemed
to have risen to meet their descending
brothers from the clouds. Gray patches of
water became more frequent among the green
patches of rank growth. Every now and

  “ The difficulty in opening car windows re-
minds me of a story told by a theatrical manager
who was featuring an Italian as 1 Biancilla, the
Strong Man from Rome.’

  “ One day, traveling from Kansas City to
Omaha in a day-coach, the strong man and his
manager were seated just ahead of a tall man with
side whiskers. The man with the side whiskers
evidently overheard the conversation between the
strong man and his manager, for after a time he
tapped the Italian on the shoulder, saying

  then you could hear the swash of the waters
  breaking away from the wheels of the lum-
  bering train.

    It grew dark, and still the train jogged
  along at an alligator’s pace. The windows
  were up and we could'see nothing through
  the rain-spattered panes but an occasional
  dismal light. Inside the compartments it
  was reeking hot—reeking is the only word.

   Finally the train came to a standstill
 after a great swashing. When it did not
 move again some of us let down the windows
 and looked out. We couldn’t see much,
 but such as we did see was mist and an
 expanse of water all around. It was as if
 a railway train had run on a reef in mid-
 ocean and we had no hope of anything but
 a stray' sail or a desert island.

   We were stuck there for hours. From
 the knee-deep footboard the conductor ex-
 pressed his opinion of the engineer, and the
 engineer from his swamped locomotive re-
 torted that he, at least, had “ never been in
 the “ porpus-house ” — which I afterward
 translated into “pauper-house” or “poor-
 house.”

    Just what that had to do with a railway
  train run aground in the middle of a lagoon
  I never found out.

    Another pleasant incident of almost ap-
  palling frequency on this road is the sudden
  stop of the train when it is mustering full
  speed. Then there will come a crash and a
  jolt, and the indignant voice of the black
  engineer will be heard shouting:

    “Dat is de foolisliest mule I ever see! I
  wouldn’t own sich a mule to me name!”

    Neither would the owner, save on paper,
  when he receives twice as much as the mule
  is worth from the Jamaica Railway.

CHAPTER XVIII,
After the Escape.

ITH daylight the wind
  hushed; the sand settled.
  Morning brought the
  fresh peace of Eden
  over the desert.

   Flying toward the
light, a sweating, panting man, with swol-
len, splitting lips and tongue and purplish
face, with dried blood staining his skin,
matted in his hair and stiffening his
clothes, loped across the sands. His gait
was weary, but never changing.

  Miles away was a water-hole. This
was his goal. In it was the only water to
be had in this direction within fifty-four
miles of the scene of his last night’s crime.

  Aided by the natural running powers
of his Zulu-Indian blood, Salarado kept
steadily, desperately on his way. To stop
meant to stiffen; to run no more, to die.

  Miles behind him but on tough, tireless
mustangs and carrying water with them,
came the living seven of the jury, led by
the raging father of Star Eves. One of the
seven had a livid mark around his neck.
Where the knot had cut into the skin the
place was raw. His neck was stiff, his
throat was sore, his head roared; but he
rode like a centaur.

  He had been cut down just in time. The
jailer dead; the sheriff dead; their five
comrades dead; the seven alone remained.
They were terrible in their avenging anger.

  To reach the water-hole first was to
capture or to kill Salarado. Nowhere else
was there for the hunted man to go; for no-
where else was there water.

Began in the December. 1910. Railroad

     Once let the seven get to the water-hole
  before Salarado, and the chase was ended.
  Then their quarry must either come stag-
  gering into their hands or dry and die in-
  sane with thirst, on the desert.

    Hence Salarado ran and the seven rode,
  racing for the water-hole.

    The sun rose. A yellow flood of light,
  cut by great streams of shadows, burst
  across the plains to the West.

     Salarado reached a small hill that over-
  looked the water-hole at its base, and his
  back-trail for miles. Revenge and justice
  were thundering along his track not far be-
  hind, and Salarado knew it.

    He paused on the tip of the knoll and
  looked back. A faint cloud of dust floated
  into the air ten miles away. Seven black
  dots for an instant bobbed against the sky.
  It was the coming jury. The ponies were
  tired. It would be a full hour before the
  horseman could reach the water-hole.

     For a few miles a ridden horse can out-
  run a man. Fifty miles makes the chances
  very nearly equal. For one hundred miles
  and over, the human runner, if lie be a
  racer among his kind and has a few hours
  start, has little to fear from any pursuit
  that travels on unsplit hoofs.

    The reindeer and the moose have divi-
  ded feet. An Indian runner will catch a
  deer in one day, a horse in five, any liv-
  ing creature in thirty. Man has will-
  power, which drives him ever onward; lie
  wastes not a unit of his strength. The
  animal has only brute force, and lacks the
  intellect with which to husband and to di-
  rect his powers to the best advantage.

    All this Salarado knew; but he was
  handicapped by clothing, food, and weap-
  ons. The pounding of the six-shooter on

his hip annoyed him. If he had been un-
encumbered and in his full strength the
chase would have been sport. As it was,
the issue was doubtful.

  When force leaves the muscles, cunning
enters the mind. An hour contains sixty
minutes; a minute contains sixty seconds;
the law of gravitation was guessed in a
second. Salarado had an hour.

  To give his surging blood -a chance to
cool, Salarado walked down the hill to
the tempting water. He found the water-
hole only a yard across and a foot deep.
It was crusted with alkali—yet it was
water.

  Moral restraint Salarado knew not; but
physically his self-control was almost per-
fect. He knelt at the edge of the water
and plunged his head into the cool liquid
to his shoulders. His mouth and eyes were
open. The water soaked into the dusty
cavities of his head. But he drank not a
drop.

  When his breath was exhausted, Salarado
raised his head. The breeze of the early
morning, and the water, cooled his fevered
blood and soothed his throbbing temples.

  Nature is above the petty quarrels of
humans.

  Then slowly and with a physical delight
that those crowded in civilization cannot
even dream of, Salarado slowly sipped a
pint of water.

  Knowing that he would stiffen if he re-
mained motionless except for a few mo-
ments, Salarado began to walk in a cir-
cle around the water-hole. He was hun-
gry. A fifty-four mile run is a wonderful
appetizer.

  He slowly ate the food, chewing it thor-
oughly, that the murdered jailer had
brought to his cell the evening before. He
had carried it all those parched, weary
miles behind him. When, where and how he
would get more, he knew not. His tongue
and lips were split and bleeding. His
own blood from the smarting cracks min-
gled with his food, but Salarado did not
notice it.

  His eyes roved warily to the hill-top
where he had recently stood. The blood
throbbing in his ears made him restless and
uneasy. It sounded like hoofs rapidly
pounding the prairie sod.

  From almost beneath his feet, a jack-
rabbit sprang up and awkwardly limped
away with swaying ears. Crack! A bul-
let from Salarado’s six-shooter left the

rabbit’s head hanging only by a bit of
skin. Salarado eagerly picked up the kick-
ing body and carried it to the water-hole.
Using the keen-edged clasp-knife he had
taken from the jailer’s body, Salarado
quickly peeled the skin from the rabbit;
but without cutting or tearing it, except
at the feet and tail. He turned the skin
flesh-side out and rapidly but carefully
cleaned it, by means of the knife and
water. With a few pieces of silk thread
from his neck-scarf—the same to which
he so largely owed his escape—he tightly
tied all the openings in the skin. He turned
the skin fur-side out. He dipped it into
the water, and brought it up full.

  W'hen Salarado had tied the neck-open-
ing the improvised skin water-bottle held
almost a gallon of the life renewing fluid.
The taste would be bad; yet it would be
water—water, ever delicious to a dusty
throat.

  All this was done without any loss of
time. The jurymen were coming. Salara-
do did not forget that. Yet water he must
have or die. It was seventy-six miles to
the next water-hole.

  Salarado to$k another drink, this time
more than before; but he sipped it as slow-
ly as he did the first. With all his cloth-
ing on Salarado crawled into the water
for a momentary bath. It was a danger-
ous thing to do, but refreshment and stimu-
lant he must have.

  The jurymen had found his whisky-
bottle empty and broken, twenty miles
back. Salarado had stumbled and fallen
in the darkness, breaking the bottle and
spilling the liquor.

  When Salarado rose, soaked and drip-
ping, the water in the spring was pink.
The diluted blood of seven men and one
woman tinted it. As his muscles were
stiffening a little and beginning to ache,
he resumed his circle walking, glanced
about, then at the hill-top. The seven
were nearer.

  Twenty feet away a dead horse. Sala-
rado, holding his breath, laboriously
hitched this mass, first by the forefeet then
by the hind, to the edge of the water-hole.

  Once more Salarado drank of the water,
discolored as it was. The desert and priva-
tion take the daintiness out of a man.
This time Salarado drank his fill. He
gulped the water down. Those horsemen
were coming.

  Then he plunged the carcass into the
MASON, THE GRIZZLY.

water-hole. The dead animal more than
filled it. He thrust his knife into the dead
animal’s body. In a few moments the water
was unfit to drink.

  Salarado grabbed up the dressed rabbit
and his water-bottle, and precipitously fled
up the wind. Halting a moment, he cut
the rabbit into several strips and fastened
them to his cartridge-belt. Meat treated
in this way does not spoil in New; Mexico;
it dries and cures, even—without salt, in
the dry, germless air of the desert.

  Here was food, and—what was of most
vital importance—drink for Salarado un-
til he could reach the next water-hole
seventy-six miles away over a blistering
waste of sand.

  The horsemen—now only a mile away—
must here turn back. They would soon
arrive, parched—both men and horses—
by their all-night chase through a sand-
storm. They would find, instead of cool
water, an undrinkable mess. Chagrin that
sickens the heart would be theirs.

  Salarado was pleased. Yet how he
longed for a handful of arsenic. This
metallic murder dissolves in water, and
leaves it tasteless, odorless, colorless, and
apparently harmless. With a little of this
malicious metal, Salarado would have poi-
soned his hunters like wolves. But re-
grets were useless. Salarado had no ar-
senic. Kill the coming jurymen as he had
their fellows, he could not. He could only
turn them back.

  If Salarado had left the water-hole un-
defiled, there his pursuers would have
camped. Then, when well rested, they
would have pushed on and overtaken him
—unavoidably handicapped as he was with
meat, water, and revolver.

  As it was, however, having cut his trail-
ers off from all water, it meant that they
must here take the back-track at once, and
ride the thirsty ponies until, one by one,
they dropped; then humanely shoot them
and push ahead on foot until the settle-
-ment was reached, or dead men as well as
dead horses would disfigure the retreat.
For the jurymen—when they came to the
water-hole—to attempt to go on after Sala-
rado without rest or water would have been
sure suicide.

  By defiling the water-hole, Salarado had
saved his life. It made his escape now
sure and easy. By doing so, however, he
had committed another capital offense,
worse than murder, even worse than horse

stealing. To defile a water-hole, or—find-
ing one so—to leave it polluted, was a deed
that meant death by rope or bullet.

   So ruled the terrible, unwritten, yet just
law of the frontier in those days on the
desert. Such a deed might mean a linger-
ing death to a whole wagon-train. But
what cared Salarado?

   To freedom and safety, Salarado sneaked
up a gulch and out of sight, just as the
seven burst over the edge of the hill, and
thundered down to the water-hole—and to
soul-strangling disappointment.

CHAPTER XIX.

Judgment by the Water-Hole.

O	ALARADO was free. He knew it.
^ They knew it. Although still tired,
he was refreshed. Food and drink, though
limited, he still had. Seventy-six miles to
the next water-hole was nothing for a run-
ner like Salarado. There he could kill a
rabbit, a prairie-dog, a coyote, or perhaps
an antelope for more food.

   A quick eye is the mother of luck—hence
Salarado was always lucky'. Telegraph-
wires were unknown in New Mexico in
those days. He would be traveling ahead
of the news. He had nothing to fear, either
ahead or behind. Two more days and he
would be safe in No Man’s Land, the haven
of all such as he. Over the next ridge front
the water-hole he would sleep, protected
from the sun, under the overhanging bank
of some dried-up watercourse during the
frying heat of the day'.

  Then through the cool evening and the
cold night he would easily cover those sev-
enty-odd miles at a steady walk up-hill and
on the level, and at a sliding trot down
grade, to rest him by changing gait.

   For the first time in his life, under these
easy circumstances, Salarado was not happy.
A sickening reaction in body, mind, and
soul \ras beginning to come over this here-
tofore pitiless man.

  What was the use—the end of it all?
What would he not give for rest and peace?
For death ?

  He stopped. Should he turn back and
defy those seven men? They would kill
him. Good! But then it would seem as if
he — Salarado — had been unable to get
.away; as if he had been run down and shot
like a coyote by men, mentally and bodily
his inferiors.
364

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

  No. Salarado would go on.

  Such were the half - formed ideas that
were beginning to rise, like mist, from the
soul, within the mind of this desperado,
who when frenzied would wantonly attack
anything. Mixing race - bloods produces
strange results, mentally a hybrid, morally
a deformity, physically a marvelous ma-
chine. Long dormant qualities, inherited
from his white fathers, were beginning to
whisper to Salarado.

  Rounding a sharp turn in the bed of the
watercourse, this soul-frightened man saw
a dying horse lying before him. Thirst was
killing it. From the slightly heaving form
a buzzard rose and slowly flapped up the
ravine. A magpie stopped pecking at the
horse’s eyes, and, refusing to leave, dipped
and tettered. scolding noisily at the human
intruder.

  Within the shadow cast by the eastern
bank, a few feet from the dying animal, sat
a girl, a vision in gold and white—Star
Eyes. ^—

  Salarado quailed. He knew her. For
the first time the eyes of the animal met the
eyes of the angel. The fiend was con-
quered. Superstitious fear, the self-
loathing of a conscience-awakened soul, the
bewildering, dazzling recognition of a here-
tofore unknown and undreamed of spiritual
affinity, and other causes that the human
mind and soul can only grope for, but can-
not grasp, brought Salarado — mentally,
morally, and in body prostrate—crying and
pleading for he knew not what at the feet
of the star-eyed.

  On the girl the effect of the meeting was
even greater than on Salarado. Exhaust-
ed by her insane wanderings on horseback
over the desert during the storm, the here-
tofore unknown strain had brought the girl
to a point where great changes, physical
and mental, sometimes occur in those with
a mind diseased.

  It meant shortly either mental life or
physical death. Something in the power-
ful, physical intensity of Salarado per-
vaded and overwhelmed the lost girl. Ex-
hausted as she was, almost to the point of
conscious dissolution, it put her body into
harmony with the perfect mechanism of
Salarado’s tigerlike physique.

  The atmosphere of his presence, the re-
vived hope it gave her, stimulated her,
thrilled her into new life. Having for the
first time been dependent on herself—and
in terrible danger, too—and knowing phys-

ical suffering for the first time, the break-
ing strain of desperately attempted logical
thought all had left the clouded mind of
Star Eyes in a semi-cleared but almost fa-
tally paralyzed state.

  The shock of seeing a bloody, disheveled,
wild-eyed giant bound suddenly around the
bend—bursting upon her like a devil—stop
and fall, moaning and shrinking at her
feet, caused a blinding, deafening flash to
crash like lightning through the mind of
Star Eyes. Then instantly all was as clear
within as the crystal air without.

  Salarado had brought to her reason as
well as life.

  The instantaneous, inexplicable dovetail-
ing of these two souls put each in tune with
the other, with the world and with heaven.
He unkeyed the mental strain in her; she
tightened the moral in him. The conversion
of a soul, the awakening of reason in a
chaotic mind, are things that cannot be ex-
plained by man. Great minds, even those
skilled in the science of the physician, can
only see and wonder. The~petty ones sneer.

  The mutual recognition of the soul affin-
ity between Star Eyes and Salarado was
instantaneous. After the first bewildering
instant she rose to her feet, no longer a be-
ing verging on the idiot, but a pure-hearted,
clear-minded woman, though swaying on
the edge of death.

  At her feet, clasping her knees with
mighty, blood-stained arms, cringed a self-
haunted man; praying, beseeching in ab-
ject terror and repentance for forgiveness
and spiritual help.

  For the first time the soul of Salarado
realized its position before God and man.
A moment before it had been Salarado, thS
buffalo, against the world. Now it was
Salarado, the convert, for the good of man.

  Star Eyes dropped a white hand onto
the wet, black, bloody hair of the cowering
Salarado, reeled, clutched at the air for
help, and staggered.

  Her shriveled throat and lips could speak
no word. Salarado leaped to his feet,
caught the fainting girl and gently laid her
down on the sands, still cool in the shadow
of the bank.

  From the rabbit - skin water-bottle he
poured a tiny stream of water down her
throat. Unable to speak, but revived—
though only a little—she silently thanked
her heretofore savage rescuer with those
great, deep, blue-black, starlike eyes. Now
they were lit with the light of reason!
MASON, THE GRIZZLY.

365

Salarado thought of Mexie — and shud-
dered.

  Like a sleepy child, Star Eyes resigned
herself to Salarado. He picked her up as
he would a wounded seraph. With her in
his arms, Salarado climbed the steep bank
of the watercourse and stepped out onto the
open prairie.

  The cursing horsemen galloped to the
hopelessly polluted water - hole, and had
turned back in sullen silence, virulently
cursing Salarado. They waited only long
enough to pull—by means of hurled rope
and saddle - horn — the carcass from the
spring. Bail it out they could not.

  On their return to the settlement a party
would be sent at once, properly provisioned
and equipped, to do that most important
thing of desert-land.

  The seven rode wearily to the top of the
hill where Salarado had stood only an hour
before. Shame-stung, they drew rein, and
for the last time scanned the deserted plains.

  Clear and crackling through the fresh
morning air rang six shots from a distant
six-shooter. Far away the hawk-like eyes
of those trained plainsmen recognized Sala-
rado. With a long, white, drooping object
in his arms, he was running toward them.

  Fourteen reddened spurs cut into four-
teen shrunken flanks. Seven men with
drawn six-shooters and poised rifles, yell-
ing hoarsely in grisly triumph, charged
down on the approaching desperado.

  Salarado, with Star Eyes in his arms, and
the seven vengeful jurymen met in silence
at the water-hole. With the seven anger
was lost in amazement. They were as-
tounded. Salarado was unarmed. His
six-shooter, his only weapon, he had cast
from him after it had .served in the first
good cause it had ever known.

   Salarado let Star Eyes slip to the ground,
where she stood, leaning against his shoul-
der and supported by his arm.

  A wondrous sight those two made, the
center of a wondrous picture. Above—the
clear blue heaven, flecked with faint wreaths
of last night’s storm: over all the awful si-
lence and majesty of the desert'. On seven
wreaking, exhausted ponies seven men sat
dumb and motionless. Above, a black dot
in the crystal blue, hung the buzzard. A
bunch of thirsty, curious, stamping ante-
lope crowned a distant knoll. A coyote, fol-
lowed by her cubs, sniffed uneasily along
the fresh trail. The morning wind breathed
among die curled buffalo grass.

  Star Eyes broke the silence. To her
father she spoke. The swollen lips would
give forth only husky whispers.

  Salarado gave her water. The jurymen
looked on hungrily. The horses scented it
and pawed the dry sand. To the worn-out
animals another hour without water meanf
death.

  With clearing voice, Star Eyes told her
story; told how she had, in her delirium,
stolen from her bed, and, saddling a horse,
had wandered awav before the storm, why
or where she knew not; how Salarado found
her; the change in him; the change in her.

  She told, with scarlet features but defiant
eyes, of her new-found but eternity-old
love for him, and of his for her. She spoke
of how, in a way unknown—dimly realized
by them, but not by the rest—how Salarado
had given her the blessing of reason; how
she had cleansed his soul; how the old Sal-
arado was dead; how they would never find
the man they sought, although his body
was before them now.

  She reminded these men of their love,
their almost holy devotion, to her—as pure
women are worshiped nowhere else but on
the frontier—of her unselfish kindnesS and
love to them and theirs, a thousand times
expressed in acts when they or their dear
ones were sick or in trouble in former years.

  She called upon each man in turn, per-
sonally and by name, to remember what
she had done for him; how she nursed this
one back to life from a bed of sickness;
bound that one’s wounds; how she had
soothed and brought comfort to another
and to those he loved; how her own hands
had prepared their dead for the grave.

  She pleaded, she demanded, that her
father, the most powerful man in New
Mexico, should keep his oath—they all had
been witnesses to it many times—that he
would give his all and himself that she,
Star Eyes, his daughter—her mother and
his deacTwife again living in her likeness—
might have reason^ come by whom or how
it may.

  Salarado had given her reason—Salarado
had given her life. Even now, but for this
man, she would be lying helpless in yonder
gulch.

  All this the girl laid before the jury at
the water-hole in the desert.

  He could have escaped, she continued;
and she showed them how. Salarado of-
fered himself that she might live—live now
in the light of reason. Salarado was a
366

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

changed man; hereafter he would live only
to do good, to do right; to correct, as far as
it was in his power, the wrongs he had
done.

  She asked that the life and liberty of her
savior—Salarado, her lover—might be hers.
Almost inspired by her new-born love—
which satisfied her heretofore life - lopg
heart - hunger — the girl leaned wearily
against her lover’s broad shoulder and
pleaded his cause.

  Star Eyes stopped. Silence came again.
Like a living statue, Salarado towered, si-
lent and without motion.

  For a second time the jurymen debated
upon the life of Salarado; this time with-
out a word, each man within himself.
What Star Eyes had said was true. Sala-
rado had been safe and free. For her
sake, for their sake through her, he was
once more their prisoner, and of his own
free will. The chivalry of it all, the
knighthood of the frontier, appealed to
those silent men.

  Yet, fifty-four miles away were ten dead
bodies—and one moaning woman with
empty eye-sockets. True, some deserved
their fate—yet the others had been inno-
cent. Six had been murdered most brutal-
ly, even tortured before their very eyes.

  They, too, had been bound by this very
Salarado before them; and but for a rare
accident they, too, would even now be ly-
ing, cold, stiff, and bloody, side by side
with their five fellow jurymen.

  Perhaps it was a trick. Yet, no. Free-
dom and life had been sure to Salarado.
This man was not the Salarado they had
known. The Salarado of old would have
killed Star Eyes. This man—their once
condemned prisoner—had proven himself
to be first a demon, then a man. Should
they now legally murder the living man be-
cause of the dead demon of moral insanity
he had annihilated within himself, or
should they—

  Suddenly the juryman with the raw,
swollen neck snapped his teeth, whipped
out his six-shooter, and fired at the breast
of Salarado. Instantly catching the move-
ment, and knowing what was coming, Star
Eyes, like a flash, stepped in front of Sala-
rado and faced the weapon with her arms
thrown bafck.

  The revolver belched death. The bullet
pierced the brain of the girl, and buried it-
self in the heart of Salarado. Star Eyes
whirled. Her soft, white arms convulsive-

ly encircled the swarthy neck of Salarado.
His great, dusky arms crushed the girl to
his brown and bleeding breast.

  The old savage light for an instant
gleamed in Salarado’s eyes. Then it died
out, and into them came a look of unutter-
able pity, forgiveness, and calm, heavenly
thankfulness. Like a tree Salarado fell,
Star Eyes in his arms.

  A sigh of guilty relief came from the
hearts of the others; all except that of the
dead girl’s father. His maddened six-
shooter instantly rattled five bullets through
the murderer of his idol and Salarado.

  From the saddle the body flopped to the
sands. Its unmounted horse snuffed at it,
snorted, and backed away. Stepping out
of his saddle, his smoking weapon still in
his hand—and flinging aside his sombrero
—the father knelt beside the dead bodies.

  The fair, sweet lips—bruised with
pleading—parted in the smile of a cherub,
he kissed. With his hand reverently on
the forehead of the dead Salarado, whose
face was like that of a bronze god, the
gray-haired man lifted his face and open
eyes to the clear heavens. He prayed, not
audibly—for the lips know not words to
fit emotions that stir the soul in its depths
—but he breathed in almost silent moans.

  Kneeling thus, with one quick motion the
stricken man fired the last shot into his
own forehead.

  On the hill above the water-hole they
buried them where they died. The body of
him who shot the lovers lay in a shallow
grave—on which the cactus refused to live
—till the coyotes dug it up and gnawed the
bones. In another grave is the body of the
father, the blackened, empty six-shooter
still clenched in his hand.

  In the third grave, deeper and broader
than the others—now marked with a stone
cross on which is rudely cut the letter “ S,”
and the legend Pax V obis cum — they laid
two bodies, wound in each other’s arms.
One small, slender, and fair, as was Star
Eyes; the other great, dark, and powerful,
that of the bad man, the fiend, the des-
perado, the buffalo—Salarado.

CHAPTER XX.
An Answer to the Stars.

TUST at dark, a month later, a man rode
^ into the camp of a white man and an
Indian at the foot of Pike’s Peak. By die
.MASON, THE GRIZZLY.

camp vvas-a flow of mineral water, now fa-
mous as Manitou Springs. By the camp-
fire the Indian was crouched in his blan-
ket, silent as wood. Standing before the
flames, his hands deep in his canvas
trousers pockets, was a hale, portly old fel-
low—the white man.

  Suddenly he turned and looked into the
circling dusk. The Indian moved his eyes
and twitched his nostrils, then relapsed into
his apparent stupor. The sound of a walk-
ing horse came nearer and nearer; then the
horseman drew rein before the fire.

  “ Good evening, pard— By all the gods
and little fishes! If it ain’t Mason! Why,
man, you’ve been dead for ten years—”
“Ben Holliday! Well, well, well—got
any supper? Dead men don’t eat—
How?” to the Indian.

  “ Ugh! Heap good,” grunted the Ute
without moving. Yet his eyes studied
Mason keenly.

  Supper was done—supper of deer meat,
beans, bread, and coffee. Then the pipes.
Long they talked. Holliday asked:

  “Where have you been? We’ve not
heard of you in years. Let’s see, the last
time I saw you was in Denver—remember
the little lady? You were starting for old
Mexico, were you not?”

  “ Yes,” mused Mason, and Holliday
wondered to which of his questions the an-
swer was given, or if it applied to both.
He smiled broadly to himself and chuckled
silently in the darkness. Mason filled his
pipe once more, rubbed his heated, smoking
shins, and began:

  “Yes. I went to old Mexico—still no-
sing after Montezuma’s forgotten prospects.
No luck of any kind for ten years. Then
I stopped at a sheep ranch on the desert in
New Mexico, and met—’er— From that
I turned cowboy for two years. Texas, In-
dian Territory; lost all I had over a bluff
in a Northerner.

  “Tried mail-carrying over Berthoud
Pass—no good. Near being hung in Hot
Sulphur, where our old friend Texas Char-
lie—whatever became of ‘ Weasel,’ by the
way? Shot? Thought so— Well, Tex
died of lead poisoning there. Then, not
long ago, I was again in New Mexico, in
the ‘ Tear of the Clouds ’ country. Came
from there here, on my way back to Den-
ver. Want to see what the old camp looks
like—”

  “Ever hear of Salarado down there?”
asked Holliday.

   Mason eyed his old friend in silence.

  “Why?” he asked.

  Then Holliday told to Mason the end
of Salarado. It was news to him. Ru-
mor can outtravel a bronco. After a long,
long silence — broken only by the Indian
throwing new wood on the fire—Mason,
for the first time in his life, told of the
affair on Berthoud Pass. When Mason
had done, Holliday said not a word, but—
the night being clear — drew his buffalo
robe about him and lay down by the fire.
Finally he asked:

   “ Mason, if on the spire that day you
could have foreseen the results of freeing
Salarado—what would you have done?”

  Long Holliday waited for his answer;
but the man gazing into the fire seemed
not to have heard him. In an hour both
Holliday and the Indian were asleep.
Mason raised his head wearily, and with
hungry eyes looked far up among the stars.
Then, as if in answer to a question, he said
. slowly:

  “What would you have done?”

       CHAPTER XXI.
       An Indian Legend.

\\T ITH the sun next morning, the night
* vanished from the plains and moun-
tains; and from the speech and actions of
the two white men and the Indian—but not
from Mason’s heart.

   Holliday’s time had almost come. Years
of frontier exposure had gnawed at that
hardy constitution and now his days were
numbered. He had come to the healing
iron-springs to find relief if not cure.
Stronger now, he was off that morning for
a week on a cattle-buving trip to the South.
The railroads had come long ago, and had
ruined his coach-line. His parting words
to Mason as he shook hands from the sad-
dle were:

  “When you go to Denver go and see my
lawyer, Judge France.”

   Then with a cabalistic laugh he galloped
away. As his old friend went down the
rocky trail, Mason saw coming up a ragged
pack-jack followed-by n man on foot. Evi-
dently he was too poor to own a horse. On
the pack-animal was a prospector’s outfit,
none too good.

   He halted at the iron-springs for a drink
and a momentary rest. To Mason’s quietly
cordial questions he made little reply, but
368

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

admitted that he would cross the peak as
lie was bound for the other side—the side
to the West. Then he moved on. This man
was Bob Womack. Ten years later he was
to give Cripple Creek to the world.

  All that day Mason lay in the warm
autumn sunshine and thought of his past
life. Here he was now, a man of thirty-
five, knocked by the world, ever climbing
up only to slip back. He could not see
where he had been at fault, yet something
within himself told him that the fault was
all his own. All day he was as silent as the
Indian. Now and then each drank from
the iron-springs. As the sun set, Mason
watched in the East for the evening star.
When it beamed at him, he said impatiently
—perhaps to it, perhaps to himself, per-
haps to the Indian:

  “ I am a dziggetai.”

  “ Si, senor,” grinned the Indian.

  “ That is Chinese for ‘ a wild ass.’ What
does a Ute buck know of Chinese?”

   “ It is Indian, senor/’ persisted the Ute.
   “ Chinese.”

  “ Indian.”

  “ Mongolian.”

  “Ugh!”

  They were both right. There is a kin-
ship between the Mongolian and the Indian
in tongue, perhaps in blood.

It was now dark in the deep ravine by
the iron springs, but the summit of Pike’s
Peak still was warm with the departing
light. The Indian pointed to it and said:
“ Manitou make sign. Heap good.”
“How?”

  Then, there in the gathering night by the
camp-fire, Mason listened first idly, then
dreamily, then fascinated to a legend old
as Indian speech. It fascinated, because in
it—all unknown to him then—was the key
to the Lost Mines of Montezuma. Acting
ten years later, on what he heard by the
camp-fire that night, Mason was to become
a power throughout the West.

  Looking long at the Peak, then saluting
the iron spring gurgling away in the dark-
ness, the Indian said in Spanish:

  “Mason, I know you. Iron Hand was
with Colorow when the quick young white
man was caught and got away. Good.
Heap good. And to his white brother now,
Iron Hand will tell what white ears have
never heard before. It is of this peak, this
iron spring, the ascension of the Manitou,
and his gold lost beyond to the West.
Listen, white brother:

  “ .An Indian stood upon the crest of the
Snowy Range. Stone, -snow, and silence
were around him; nothing else. It was the
Manitou. The Great Spirit looked from
the eternal snows out over the plains and
mountains. The heart of the Manitou was
heavy.

  “ Clouds of dust floated like a thunder-
storm along the shimmering horizon far to-
ward the rising sun. The prairies were
black with buffalo. Through the wild herds
darted fleet clouds of coursing antelope. A
herd of wild horses swept along with the
easy swiftness of swallows. The mountain-
forests were crowded with deer and wapiti.
Trout flashed their spotted sides in the sun-
light from a thousand streams and lakes.
The great bear was lord of all, acknowledg-
ing only man as master.

  “ In the zenith shone the sun, never mov-
ing, never dimmed. All was good and fair
to the eye over the plains and among the
mountains of the land which the palefaces,
some ages hence, were to call Colorado. The
heart of die Manitou was heavy.

  “ All this had he made for his children,
the red riders of the plains and mighty
hunters of the mountains. But the prairie-
riders slew dieir brothers of the mountains,
and the mountaineers crept by night into
the sleeping-camps of the plainsmen, slew
them in the tepees, and stole their women
and their ponies. The heart of the Manitou
was heavy.

  “ Blood of his warring children stained
his works, good and fair. Ungrateful, they
had disobeyed him.

  “ In sorrow the Great Spirit gazed over
the prairies and the peaks—and into the
open sky. Here was peace. Here would
he go.

  “ He gave the word. The voice of the
Manitou echoed through the canons. A
mist arose and hid the earth—but the sun-
light played upon the summits. With his
tomahawk, the Manitou hewed out the rock
and made an altar such as men and gods
never had seen before. This altar the pale-
faces were some day to call Pike’s Peak.
It was his altar of ascension. He would
leave the world to the warring brothers, but
his gold he would take with him. The altar
rose among the mountains, higher, greater
than them all. At length it was completed.
A mande of snowy down, crusted with glis-
tening jewels, softly fell from heaven upon
it. The Manitou stood upon the summit.
The heart of the Manitou was heavy.
MASON, THE GRIZZLY.

369

  "Far to the north loomed two great piles.
Some day these were to be called by a
harsh tongue, long and gray. Hidden there
was gold and silver. Colorado contained
more than the Manitou could carry.

  “ In the purple distance toward the warm
south-land shone the twin mounds to be
known as the Spanish Peaks. Beautiful
they were' in their snowy purity, but base.
Beneath their virgin whiteness was nothing
precious, only cold stone. They lured.
They lied.

  “By a growing chasm they stand divided
even unto this'day. and forever, until their
atoms shall dissolve in eternity. But greater
than these three was the altar beneath the
foot of the Manitou. The heart of the Mani-
tou was heavy.

   “ The birds, the animals, the reptiles, and
the red children of the Manitou. war now
forgotten, gathered round its base. They
filled the earth as far as eye could see. The
world was black with life. All was silence.
A belated wild duck'came whistling through
the air, and sank into the multitude.

  “Living creatures were without motion.
The wind died. The waters hung limpid
in the steep gulches. Leaves and grasses
withered. ‘ Darkness fell. Through the
stagnant blackness rose on perfumed wings
the spirits of die dead flowers and kissed
the feet of their Creator. Above all, arched
the dome of heaven, hung high with multi-
tudinous clouds of a thousand tints wreathed
to welcome the coming Manitou. The air
froze. The heart of the Manitou was heavy.

  “The Manitou, the Great Spirit, the God
of Nature and of nature’s children was leav-
ing them, leaving them alone. With sorrow
the Manitou had hidden the earth beneath
a black shroud, and had turned to the light
above. As the black clouds hid his form
forever, a great cry "went up. The winds
shrieked. Mountains, torrents, roaring with
anguish, tore loose huge rocks arid hurled
them down upon the plains.

  “Quivering to their hearts, the moun-
tains split into fragments. The earth ripped
ragged gashes across its face. With fla-
ming swords the lightning slashed the sky.
The crash of the tumbling thunder silenced
all ears. Nature lacerated herself in re-
pentant grief.

  “ The cry pierced the black clouds, out-
echoed the thunder, and reached the ear
of the ascending Manitou. The lowering
blackness writhed a hesitating instant, then
floated high above the earth, changed to

   12	RR

white, and, dissolving, disappeared forever.
Never more will its shadow rest upon the
plains and mountains of Colorado.

  “Sunlight, warm with life, flooded the
earth. All nature sighed in sorrow, but with
relief—forgiven. On . a chariot of rolling
vapor, dazzling white, drawn by the winds,
rode the Great Spirit to the land of the
setting sun. In the West hung a ball of
fire, lighting with blinding splendor the
pathway of the Manitou.

   “ In pity, tlie Manitou dropped a tear for
his repentant children. It fell at the foot
of his eternal altar, to the East. Here, this
healing spring has flowed for ages; for red
men arid for white, for black, for yellow,
and for brown, all children of the Manitou.
To this day do these waters bear his name.
This was his parting gift to the Indians of
the prairies.

  “As the Manitou rolled high o’er the
mountain summits on his level path of sun-
beams straight to the West as an arrow
flies, for his mountain children he dropped
all his golden treasures. These fell at the
foot of his altar, to the West. This treasure
the white man will some day call 1 Wounded
Waters.’

  “ Each day, just at sunset, the mantle of
the Manitou floats over his altar, and re-
flects the treasure at its foot as if the gold
were molten in a volcanic caldron far be-
low. Then through the night from the
mantle falls the dew, giving eternal life to
the altar spring.

  “ The gifts of the Manitou are equal.
They live forever. So long as the spring
does flow, so long will the gold be found.
Botli for man, neither can be exhausted.

  “ The shadows are the children of the
night. Every day at the hour of the as-
cension, at the setting of the sun, like wild
animals shadows creep out of the ravines

the two lay watching the stars rise in the
East, pass through the heavens, and go out
of sight beyond the peak. One was dream-
ing of the past; the other of the future.

Peak—what?

       CHAPTER XXII.
          A Lawsuit.

A/f ASON arrived in Denver at jnid-
-*■ night. The old frontier mining-
camp was gone. Here was a city—“ The
Queen City of the Plains.”

  For the rest of the night he slept where
his horse did—in the old Elephant Corral.

  Before sunrise next morning—a stranger
in a strange place that in his mind he
had long called “ home ”—Mason wan-
dered through the crowded, nervous streets
down to the now walled-in bank of Cherry
Creek.

  He could only vaguely guess at the spot
where fifteen years before his bookstore
had stood. On all sides were buildings.
The waste of sand along the creek had
been changed into city lots. Nowhere was
there a trace of the flood of 1864.

  Something of a half-remembered emo-
tion suggested that he sit there and smoke
and plan anew. Here a friendly hand
closed down on his shoulder.

  “Mason! Well, where on earth did you
come from! ”

  “ Judge France,” beamed Mason, aris-
ing and gripping the lawyer's hand. “ Hol-
liday told me to look you up. Suppose
he thought you'd be the only man in these
wooden gulches and brick canons that I'd
know. Saw him in camp down by the
iron springs at the foot of Pike’s.”

  “Marius brooding over a mighty lively
Carthage, eh? How does Denver look tcf
you ? ”

  “ Don’t know it. Was trying to locate
my old stamping ground; where i once sold
books and dealt in gold dust—if you re-
member—”

  “Remember! Mason, no man would
ever forget you—’’

  “ By the way,” broke in Mason to dodge
the compliment, “ who owns all this land
about here ? ”

  “ You do.”

  “Me? Get out! I’m too near broke to
rob my bronco of- oats with which to buy
a hotel bed. So it's rather a ragged joke
—comprendo? ”

  “ I'm not joking, Mason. This land is
yours. For the past ten years no one has
heard of you. Many thought you dead,
some tried to jump your claim, but Hol-
liday paid the taxes, and leased it in your
name when it became valuable—and the
court took caie of the rest—at my sugges-
tion, now and then,-’ the lawyer added,
modestly.

  Mason closed his mouth and picked up
his pipe from the dust.

  “ But how came I to own it?” he finally
managed to ask.

  “ Remember how you gave back that
bookstore to the pretty widow—after the
books went down Cherry Creek, at that?
Remember the deed she gave you—infor-
mal, but good as gold. Holliday was a wit-
ness, you remember?”

  “ Y-e-s,” murmured Mason, vaguely.
“Let’s see. I'd forgotten all about that for
years—”

  “ But Holliday hadn’t, you see. He put
the deed on record and it's good to-dav,
but—”

  “But what?”

   “ She’s fighting it.”

  “Who?”-
  “The widow.”

  “Well, it's hers, isn't it? Still—”

  “Not by a long shot, Mason. It was
not worth fort}- cents and a dead dog when

she pave it to you in return for that twelve;
hundred dollars in gold-dust for the. books.
But she’s a stunner, though ! Still in her
twenties, she claims—but I doubt it, al-
though she looks like eighteen yet, I'll
admit—and still a widow.

  “ She came to Denver and began suit
about a .year ago; but I've managed to de-
lay things with no trouble. Besides she’s
short of money. But so’s Holliday for
that matter, and the land’s tied up—or
rather was—and you dead or alive, no one
knew. Now you have a clear case. We'll
push it to a close when court* opens next
month.”

  “What’s all this land worth? asked
Mason, in a daze.

  “Something over a million.”

  A stare was the only answer the smiling
judge received.

  “ Me! A million! ”

  “A million—and over.”

  “ Judge, leave me now, please. I wani.
to think. But first show me where my
old book-stall was. Over there? Thanks,
Judge; thank you. I'll Lie down to your
office—where is it? Larimer, corner of
Fifteenth? Good—I'll be; down there pret-
ty soon.”	„
' “To lunch?”

  “■ Si, I want to count all my grains of
sand—I mean gold—first.”

  So the lawyer left him. Mason wan-
dered over the pile of tin cans that marked
the site of his last store. Here he filled
his pipe—and gazed at the city about him.
at the ground beneath his feet, at the sky
smiling over head.

  Mason thought it a perfect morning.
He was as poor as ever—so he seemed to
himself—all this belonged to others, to
any one but himself; but the sky, the air,
and the morning was still his. Unable to
realize it allv he arose and said aloud:
“Take all things with a sense of humor
and a knowledge of astronomy.”

  Just then the sun rose. Mason looked
straight into its glory and laughed out-
right.

  At noon a man walked into Judge
France’s office. He carried himself with a
fresh dignity, a new importance. The
following conversation took place:

   “ Judge, you'd better drop that case, don't
you think?”

  “Drop it! Now, see here—don't get any
raw, fool notions in your head about—”
“Well, you’d better not fight it—”

 “Why?”

  “ I’ve married die lady.”

CHAPTER XXIII.
Woman, Wolf, and Wilderness.

TONG’S PEAK is on the northeastern
' edge of Middle Park. At its foot is
Grand Lake. On the peak from its base,
where the waters of the lake kiss its foot,
far up the sides of where the clouds rest,
grow the pine trees. Dancing across- the
lake come the waves; they are always rest-
less, chafing and complaining among the
rocks that guard the shores of this moun-
tain lake. The waves tell strange tales of
the dark Indian tragedies that lie hidden
in the black depths, hundreds of feet below.

  But at times the lake is quiet and the
waves sleep, and only murmur drowsily
in their dreams. Then the pines whisper
to one another of the things they know, and
writhe slowly in sympathy at the scenes
they have beheld.

  On the shores of Grand L*ke, just at
the foot of the peak, stands a ruined log-
cabin. The logs are rotting, the roof is
fallen in, and in winter the snow drifts fill
the empty rooms to the eaves. Once this
moldering cabin was a hunting lodge owned
by one of the wealthiest men—Mason the
millionaire.

  His winter leisure was spent in forced
social gaiety in Denver; in the empty, soul-
destroying life of city pleasure; seldom ele-
vating, always frivolous. To the lodge he
came in summer, to hunt and fish. His
family he brought with him; his fashion-
able wife, attended by a maid born in
Paris; “Black Mammy,” the negress of the
Old South; and the little elf of a child,
called Ruth. '

  The maid took care of the ennuied
mother, who pined and complained for she
knew not what, and vented her spleen on
every one; even on little Ruth.

  To Ruth this queen of fashion was a
strange, beautiful goddess, a bad fairy
such as Black Mammy told her of when
she laid her sleepy golden head on her
breast and was hushed to sleep; but this
divinity was no mother.

  Ruth often wondered if the tall, stately
woman was an angel. Mammy had once
shown her a picture of an angel. These
thoughts Ruth told not even to Black Mam-
my, but only to her baby, her real baby,
372

the one made of rag.? that her dusky nurse
had created for her.

  Of the beautiful wax creations, works of
mechanical art, which the stately woman
had given her, Ruth stood somewhat in
awe. To Ruth they looked, and acted, like
the giver.

  Between Ruth and her nurse were many
secrets. The chief one was a little leather
bag securely hidden beneath the child's
clothing. No one except the wearer and
the giver knew of this. No one ever saw
it, for no one except Black Mammy ever
dressed the child.

   P'or this treasure, the great-hearted, hoo-
doo-haunted African woman had given the
earnings of seventy-seven days to a heart-
less charlatan. In it was a snake’s tooth,
a rabbit foot and the talons of a wild tur-
key. This charm against all evil Ruth
had worn ever since she could remember.

  Human-like, one day, Ruth became an-
gered—with unreasoning, causeless, child-
ish furv, perhaps inherited—against her
guardian. No one loved her, thought Ruth
to herself. She would go away, would go
away up the wonderful mountain to where
the clouds grew. There were the angels,
oh, so good to little girls; and the fairies
—who always played.

  Black Mammy had told her so, and
Black Mammy knew. But she was angry
at Black Mammy. She would be revenged.
She went to the edge of the lake—a for-
bidden spot—and threw into the dark water
the priceless, all-protecting bag.

  Terror-stricken at what she had done,
the child fled to her nurse and begged her
to come and get it back. As frantic as the
child, the negro woman reached the rocky
edge just in time to see the water-soaked
charm slowly sink into the depths. Then
for the first time, in fear-frenzied anger,
the slave to superstition struck the little girl.

  Recoiling from her first blow—and from
Black Mammy, too—the heartbroken child
fled to the woods, and disappeared among
the trees, going straight up the mountain
to the angels and the fairies. The negress
groveled in prayer, beseeching mercy from
the non-existing spirits of her mind.

  Soon after this, Mason came down the
mountain. In triumph he bore the grizzly
skin of a timber wolf, his first one and the
first kill of the season. There had been
two of them, mates. One he had killed;
the female escaped wounded on one fore-
foot.

  Mason had followed the bloody tracks
in swift pursuit but had lost them. While
trailing the crippled wolf, he had fired at

and wounded a doe but had neglected fur-
ther search for her because of his eager
chase of more exciting game. The skin
of the dog-wolf was to be dressed, lined
with costly silk, and made into a robe for
little Ruth.

  Mason loved his little daughter. The
mother languidly suggested that the skin
would do better as a floor rug. Pangs of
something like disgust for his hollow life
and remorse for neglect of the good, the
beautiful and the true—which to him were
personified in little Ruth—all that day had
been gnawing at the man’s soul.

  Each hour the ache had grown more de-
fined. With a shadow of disappointment
—not unmixed with contempt and anger—
on his face Mason sought Ruth.

  Ruth was gone. Where? No one knew.
From Black Mammy came only half-in-
sane lamentations as she raved about devils,
evil spirits, and untold horrors and pointed
to the mountain top.

  Ruth was lost: lost in the forest that
covers Long’s Peak and stretches away for
miles over the Rocky Mountains.

  For an instant Mason was stunned.
Then he raised his rifle and sent bullet
after bullet skipping over the glassy waters,
almost but not quite directly toward a
group of cabins half hidden on a distant
shore of the lake.

  The ringing shots, fired as fast as human
skill could work a rifle, and the spray-
dashing bullets brought a man out from
among the cabins to the shore. The moun-
tains too took up the call, and rang and
echoed with the mimic thunder of the gun.

  A cry for help, oft repeated, went trem-
bling faintly across the uneasy- waters.
Little Ruth was known and loved by every
man. woman, child, dog and horse- for
miles. Ruth was lost.

  Keen hunters who had trailed wild ani-
mals ever since boyhood took up the trail
like Indians. Others, less skilful, hunted
in all directions at random. Men on horse-
back dashed over every road and trail for
help. A child was lost in the woods—
woods through which prowled and slunk
wild animals,' dangerous even to armed
men. Night was coming on

  Some souls are like some ears; dull to

let into the inner part emotions heretofore
unknown.

  What an hour before had been a stately,
living statue, was now a woman—a mother.
Now she was kneeling in silent prayer,
now raving in wild grief, now cursing her-
self, now staring before her at nothing.
Mason, hard as frozen iron, gave quiet,
clear-cut orders.

  On the shore of the lake, not far from
the rotting cabin, is a huge rock, hurled
ages ago down the mountain-side and into
the lake. On the tip of this stood a-
woman, now truly queenly. Her long red-
dish, golden hair was flying in the ‘evening
breeze, which was just beginning to sweep
down the peak and out over the waters of
the lake.

  The white summit of the peak was
..sparkling like frosted silver, in the eve-
ning sunlight, against an eastern sky of
the softest blue. At timber-line the purple
vapors of a mountain evening were begin-
ning to gather among the trees. Like a
Titan statue in colors seemed this queenly
mother -on the rock.

  Slowly the blue vapors left the trees,
floated into the darkening air, and shaped
themselves into the form of a child with
its baby arms folded across its breast, and
with its face uplifted to heaven toward
which it was slowly rising. As the sunlight
glorified the cloud, it took upon itself liv-
ing tints. The flowing curls turned to
gold, and the robe was white. The cloud,
thus wreathed by nature, was a vision in
the blue evening sky of little Ruth.

  Suddenly the white robe was blotched with
scarlet. The form writhed and squirmed;
became more ethereal, all was white; and
the now angel form had a pair of snowy
wings. Slowly the vapor arose above the
summit, slowly it spread its white pin-
ions, slowly it outstretched its arms in a
farewell kiss to the spellbound statue be-
low. Then it disappeared in the transpar-
ent turquoise of the evening air.

  The Western sky was overcast. It was
dark on the waters of the lake. Motion-
less on the rock the queenly mother *tood.
Suddenly in the clear mountain air, on a
bare point of rock far up the mountain-
side, little Ruth stood forth. This was
no cloud, it was Ruth herself.

  A single ray of sunlight pierced the
black clouds in the West and lit up the lost,
fear-crazed child like a halo. The hunt-
ers saw her, too. With a shout they all

started for what is to this day called the
Rock of Ruth. The wild baby, frightened
anew by the voices, turned and disappeared
into the dark aisles of the forest.

  A woman’s shriek chilled through the
night. It was answered by the distant cry
of a panther. The echoes took up both
cries, mingled them into one horrid sound,
and sent it quavering from crag to crag'
through every glen. As silence came once
more, the soul-freezing howl of a wolf, a
cry of suffering and of revenge, again made
rasping chaos of the evening stillness.

  Search was useless. All was darkness.
The placid lake reflected not a point of
light, for the stars had draped themselves
in cloudy blackness.

  That night the snow came. All through
the night the mother’s cries were answered
by the yells of a panther on Long’s Peak.
The wolf was silent.

  One little shoe, a blood-rimmed hole
worn through the sole, was all of his baby
Ruth that Mason, after days of search, laid
in the lap of the now awakened mother.

  One day, a hard-faced man with the
desperate, hunted look of a criminal, came
to Mason and told him of a fair-haired
child held captive by an old Indian wom-
an who led the life of a hermit, a diseased
outcast from her tribe, banished to die alone
in the wilderness like Hagar.

  The man asked for blood-money. Mason
leaped upon tire human brute, but, weak
from suffering, his attack was worse than
useless. The man fled, never to return.
Far and wide he was sought by men with
ropes at their saddle-liorns; but he was
never found.

  Black Mammy had vanished. The last
seen of her, she was kneeling on the edge
of the lake where Ruth had cast in the
priceless charm; kneeling with her black,
outstretched arms raised to the little girl
as she stood, sunlit, outlined against the
evening sky on the point of rock. The
waves often whisper strange tales of what
they, and no one else, know.

  Where was Ruth? Mason’s millions and
his mind and heart centered on this alone.

CHAPTER XXIV.
In the Mountains.

"VJlfHEN Ruth fled up the mountain,
smarting under the heretofore un-
known insult of a blow, she was going

straight to the home of the fairies up in
the beautiful sky. No one on earth loved
her. she said in her childish heart—and,
perhaps, truthfully—except Black Mammy.

   To this little girl, for the time, the negro
woman was the world; and now the whole
world abused her. Soon, however, the baby
fell over a root, and struck her tender
cheek in the same place where it was yet
bruised and aching from the blow of her
nurse. Her precious bag was in the lake.

  This must be one of those ugly black
things which hurt and sometimes eat little
girls when they are naughty, so Black
Mammy had said. With a shrill shriek
the baby arose, and, endowed with the
false strength given even to- the grown by
fear, clambered up the rocks and through
the tangled underbrush with frantic haste.

  Often when a man—a leader among his
kind in civilized life—becomes bewildered
in the labyrinth of the woods and moun-
tains, in a few hours his mind, under the
awful pressure of nature at such a time,
becomes unbalanced, and lie rushes head-
long in all directions. In a few moments
little Ruth was a wild animal, bereaved of
sanity, and guided only by the animal in-
stincts which are intuitive in the young of
all creatures, those of man not excepted.

  Endowed with new-found strength, Ruth
climbed the mountain with a rapidity im-
possible under other circumstances, and
fully as fast as could a man. Impediments
which to a larger frame would have been
impossible were easily passed through, or
under, by little Ruth. Under fallen logs
she crept on all fours, and through the
interwoven underbrush close to the ground
she went like a rabbit From far below
came the sounds of pursuit.

  Once, indeed, did Ruth> abnormally
sharpened ears catch the sound of ap-
proaching footsteps. Hiding behind a
rock, she saw her breathless father pass
within a few feet of her. When he shout-
ed out her name in a voice heard a mile
away, the xhild crouched to the ground like
a fawn. When he had passed on along the
mountain-side, but was still in sight, his
back turned, Ruth darted into a thicket and
noiselessly made her way up the steep in-
cline, stopping now and then to hide and
rest when she heard the noise of a searcher
near.	^

  At last they were all below her. For a
while she climbed up, always up, through
brushwood impassable for a man. Fright-

ened and wounded animals always run up-
hill. Why? No one knows.

  Suddenly Ruth reached a clear spot on
the edge of a precipice. Below her lay the
lake and the smaller mountains. Stepping
with the assurance of a mountain goat out
to the very edge, she nimbly climbed to the
tip of a projecting crag. Above her hung
the cloud, but Ruth saw it not.

  Here they saw her last. Far below in
the bluish depths of the evening air Ruth
saw her mother. For one fleeting instant
reason returned. She uttered a cry for her
mother and toddled on the edge, about to
fall hundreds of feet to the now black rocks
below; but the horror of it all instantly
banished reason, and the little girl was an
animal again—cool, sure-footed, and keen
with the guidance of instinct.

  The joyful shouts of the hunters reached
her ears. Like a lamb before the dogs, she
turned; sprang down the jagged point of
rock, and darted up the timbered slope.

  Night was coming on. When it is dark
in the village it is still light where Ruth
was. Twilight loves to linger on the moun-
tain heights. For an hour Ruth had heard
a creeping sound, slowly stealing upon her.
At times it was behind her; at others above
her, or to the right or left: but usually above
her.

  As she darted from the point of rock and
ran beneath the shadows of the pines, a
great yellow cat bounded away from her
up the mountain. Fearing nothing—for in
humans instinct is never perfect—and dim-
ly recognizing an exaggerated likeness to
the house-pet of Black Mammy, Ruth
scrambled on after the panther, calling:

  "Kitty, kitty—prettv kitty, I won't
’urt ’ou.”

  The panther stopped, sprang into a tree,
and snarled through its. teeth. Ruth ran
beneath the limb and reached up her baby
arms. Then from the beast came the
screech that the mother and hunters heard.

  With this horrid cry the cowardly brute
leaped from the tree far out into the con-
cealing undergrowth. Disappointed and
aggrieved, and more lonely now than ever.
Ruth climbed on up the mountain.

  The fairies and the angels were now for-
gotten. Instinct, that of a young animal,
alone ruled her mind. The air was be-
coming cold. Strange shapes were appear-
ing and disappearing here and there before
the child’s glassy eyes

  Her breath came in quick, short gasps.
MASON, THE GRIZZLY.

Her foot was hurting her; it was bleeding.
She pulled off her shoe and threw it over
a cliff. A faint remembrance of the charm
and the lake-edge was called to her mind ;
with it came the horror and the terror that
possessed her then.

   She stood grasping a bent twig for sup-
port. Letting go, it rebounded and struck
her injured cheek. Again that blow! With
a pitiful cry the child made frantic pace up
the rocks, her bare foot leaving bloody
tracks behind.

   A plaintive cry, child-like in its plead-
ing, complaining treble, almost an echo of
that of Ruth’s, came from below her, not
far distant. Savage nostrils were hotly
sniffing the bloody little footprints.

  Faintly up the mountain came a cry of
anguish from the distant depths. The
voice and tone were strange to Ruth; she
heard them not.

   Every muscle aching, chilled to the bone,
and reeling for a sudden want of sleep, the
lost baby staggered into a thicket and
against a fallen log. This log had lain
here for fifty years. Once it had been a
mountain king for a century: but it was
npw decayed; and the black ants had eaten
out its heart till the log was a mere shell,
cut through in places on the underside.

   Unable to get under the obstruction, and
lacking strength to clamber over, Ruth felt
her way along it. Feeling slowly in the
gathering darkness, her little hands found
a warm, hairy mass.. It was a deer, sick
from a bullet-wound, and helpless because
of the paralyzing fear caused by those
childlike cries from a savage throat so near.

   Freezing, half naked as she was, little
Ruth crowded close to this warm body lying
beside and partly beneath the lo", hesi-
tated a moment, then crawled close in be-
tween the doe and the arching log. With a
sigh of relief, grateful for the warmth, the
baby snuggled close to the wounded animal
and slept.

  The wounded doe, her wildness overcome
by suffering, their mutual danger, and an
instinctive knowledge of coming death—
the chill of whidi was already thickening
her blood—was thankful, too, for the pres-
ence and the warmth of the child.

  Two days before, the doc had returned
to fills very clump of bushes to find her
fawn, hidden not long before with all the
cunning of a wild mother, gone. In its
place only a mass of bloody leaves, while
great daw marks scarred the log. The

keenest of noses told her that the yellow
murderess still lingered,

  One lacked a mother, the other an off-
spring. In the night Ruth awoke. The
deer was trembling. Two lurid balls of
greenish-yellow fire burned a dozen feet
above them. Ruth, hungry, and with every
nerve stinging with pain, began to cry. At
the sound of the human voice, again did
that horrid screech of the panther echo
among the mountains. A dark, supple
form slipped noiselessly as a shadow from
the limb overhead and disappeared; yet
hungered near. Then faintly through the
night the cry of a heart-torn woman came
quivering from the airy depths.

  Finally Ruth fell asleep. The blood-
sapped deer was chilled to the heart. Both
were cold. The wind came up cold and
biting.^. -

  Around them in slowly narrowing circles
a prowling, crawling form tracked a spiral
in the snow, with the deer and the baby as
the center—and the end. The odor of a
human being still held that fanged danger
at bay; but the night was almost gone, and
for two days the panther had not eaten.
Her last meat had been a fawn in that very
thicket.

  Daylight came. Through the air from
a dark pine-tree, like a curving ray of sun-
light, flashed a yellow snarl. With a death
cry — low, pleading, gasping—the deer
bounded into the air with the panther on
her back. What followed is not for human
eyes, yet Ruth saw it all. Motionless, se-
curely hidden in her still warm bed beneath
the log, the baby watched this world-old
tragedy of the woods.

  The dark green trees, the gray deer, the
yellow panther, with dripping jaws; the
far-away, dawn-obscured background of
the purple mountains; the molten silver of
the lake in the dusky depths; the rosy-
tinted, glittering peak above—all made a
picture seldom seen and never to be for-
gotten.

  Other eyes hungrily watched the kill. Far
above among the rocks a wolf looked down.
Three of her footprints in the fresh snow
were perfect; the fourth showed the marks
of a bloody, shattered bone and a dragging
foot. The hungry wolf licked her own
blood from the frozen paw, now hanging to
the jagged stump only by a half-gnawed
sinew.

  Gorged to the utmost, hastened by fear
of the child-seekers coming up the moun-

tain, the panther—with a mass of venison in
her mouth—lightly and noiselessly, bound-
ed away to he*- young in a cave across the
gulch.

The hunters never found the dead deer.
Ruth crunched wide-eyed beneath the log.

CHAPTER XXV.
A Little Child.

T N the city it was nearly midnight. The
Christmas bells were singing in the
frost, eager to peal forth “ Glory to God in
the Highest.”

  The year before one of the palaces that
grace Capitol Hill of Denver had been lit
by a hundred lights. In the great hall there
had been a silver spruce that reached from
polished floor to gilded ceiling. Here had
danced the wealthy and the gay of Denver.
Up near the roof, in a dark room, a portly
negro woman had been lowly singing a fe-
verish, neglected baby to sleep.

  On the dancing floor that night the gid-
diest of the gay and thoughtless crush had
been the mother. That was a year before.

  This night the pile of gray stone was
dark. Only from one window came light—
a window near the caves. Here the waver-
ing light told of a fire dancing in a grate
of an otherwise darkened room.

  In this room, on a wolfskin rug before
the open fire in Ruth's room lay a woman.
Her form was queenly, but broken. The
tawny hair—not unlike that of a panther—
now lusterless, was lined with silver here
and there. The eyes were red, but dry.
They ached. Wealth she had, and what
wealth could buy, but not happiness.

  On the now shrunken neck was a string
of pearls. Once they had graced the breast
of a doge of Venice. Before the woman,
between the stiffened ears of the ghastly,
leering, stuffed head of the wolf, was a
jewel-box.

  In it was a baby’s shoe—soiled, torn, and
weather-beaten—with a dark-rimmed hole
through the sole. The palace was hers.
The world had been ransacked to adorn it.
The priceless scrap-pile of five continents
was hers—yet she grieved.

  From the frozen street below came a
scream. Through the icy air it sounded
clear and cruel to the silently moaning
woman, lying on the gray hide before the
fire. It was only the cry of a laughing
girl as she slipped intentionally 011 the side-

walk and not unwillingly fell back into her
lover’s arms. ^

  To the childless mother above the laugh
was the screech of a panther. She tore
from her neck the string of jewels. Pearls
rolled over the floor like marbles. The one
remaining in her hand, the largest—a gem
once the wonder of a Venetian court—this
soul - wrung woman ground between her
teeth, and broke both jewel and teeth! What
cared she? Had not savage jaws crunched
a thing more precious?

  On the frozen slopes of Long's Peak that
night stood a gaunt she-wolf, dying of hun-
ger. With the others of her kind she could
not hunt; she, a cripple. She must hide,
alone; or serve as meat for the famished
pack.

  To her old den in the rocks, far above
timber-line^-she had returned. Many days
she had been away. In the den were the
frozen skin-covered bones of her cubs. She
ate them. Two months before she had seen
her mate die. Wounded herself, unable to
crawl, spring, or run. she had seen her
young slowly starve.

  Desperate with hunger for herself and
young, she had once painfully dragged to
the den the skinned carcass of a male wolf
and the torn remnants of a doe. On this
they had lived. When it failed she left on
three feet in search of meat. The cubs
starved and died.

  To-night she had climbed the heights to
the den to die.

  Over the top of the white peak slowly
rose a burnished shield. Set it was in a
field of darkest blue, studded with stars,
framed with the softest of black clouds,
edged with dazzling white. The shadow
of the lone wolf standing 011 the rock shot
far down the white mountainside like a
black spear. The end of the shadow dis-
appeared in the inky depths of. a thicket
far below.

  The eyes of the wolf ranged for a hun-
dred miles the frozen, moonlit scene of
black and white. The lake was gone. All
was white'down there. All was still, cold,
dead. The world was dark and dead. The
wolf lifted her head to give tongue to that
which alone could make the scene more
drear.

  As the gaunt hand was lifted, the end of
the shadow left the black thicket. The
wolf stopped, still silent. In that thicket
she had had her last taste of living blood.
How the warm blood had spurted, hot and

teeming in the frosty air, when she sunk her
teeth into the gurgling throat.

  This remembrance gave the wolf new
life. Down the glittering slope she flew
with great leaps, unmindful of the tender
stump. Like the shadow of death she en-
tered into the thicket. The middle of it was
clear. Here rotted a great log. Here the
moon shone like a glazed sun. Through
the frozen crust the wolf dug with a single
paw. Her jaws seized a bone and pulled it
to the surface. The bone was dry and bare
and chalky.

  A howl of a wolf echoed from the crags
and cliffs of Long’s Peak. In the awful cry
was hunger, death, despair, revenge, tri-
umph, and justice. In the howl was the
life strength of a timber-wolf.

  Down on the shores of the frozen lake,
in a log cabin, a bride-mother heard that
agoriy go freezing by, and she hugged
closer her new - born. The mountaineer
glanced at his rifle and at the barred door.

  At the foot of the peak a half-grown
buck, which that day had won his first
fight, heard that cry, and crowded under
the belly of his dam, throwing both into
the snow, where they lay bleating in help-
less terror.

  The echoes carried the she-wolf’s cleath-
cry miles away through the soundless
night, and faintly into a panther’s den.
The great cat, standing over her young,
shuddered at that cry, bristled and bared
her teeth and snarled. Two clumsy cubs
that had been rolling, ball-like, playing
with the gnawed hoof of a deer, slunk close
to the panther mother.

  As the last note rolled from between the
yellow fangs the death-rattle sounded in
the throat of the dying wolf. In the last
paroxysm, the wolf clenched her teeth into
the dry bone on which rested the now
bleeding stump. The bone cracked and
split between the iron jaws. There it
stayed. The bone was a child’s skull.

  In the president’s private office a man
sat in his chair asleep. His face was
gaunt as Lincoln’s. The man shuddered

and jerked now and then in his fitful
sleep. Suddenly he aroused himself wear-
ily, passed his hands through his gray,
twisted mass' of hair and pressed them
hard over his hollow eyes. But nothing
could shut out the blood-congealing image
of a frozen peak with a black lake at its
foot.

  The sight of a mountain of crusted sil-
ver froze his burning mind. Long he sat,
looking straight ahead of him into nothing-
ness. Then slowly he said:

  “This is the life of a coward. If she
is under that crust, I can at least live for
others—and for her mother.

  “Brute! In your selfishness you have
thought only of yourself—of your own sor-
row! You have left her, your wife, her
mother, without help to bear her load
alone. Hers is the greater burden — she
does not love me; but we both love her.

I	will go to her and I will help her.”

  He pushed away from the paper-littered
table as a thing abhorrent. As fast as horse
could go Mason went to his home.

  Just within the door of the dim fire-lit
room he stopped and bowed his head. Un-
conscious of his presence, the woman on the
wolf-skin was still fondling the baby’s shoe.
Reverently he went and knelt beside her.

  A look! A cry! The gulf that had al-
ways yawned between them was bridged in
silence too deep for words. For the first
time in their lives this man and this woman
met face to face, mind to mind, heart to
heart, soul to soul—knew each other and
their own inner selves.

  Invisible baby hands knitted together the
fibers of their mutual being.

   Stealing clear on the still, blue air came
the tones of a single bell—then burst the
merry, metal chorus, welling, swelling, chi-
ming merrily the glad Christmas tidings.
The woman raised her face, and moaned':
“Ruth, Ruth, Ruth—oh, Heaven, give
my baby back to me! ”

  The man stroked her hair and bowed his
head above hers, and murmured deeply:

  “ Thy will be done.” -

The Railroad Man’s
Brain Teasers.

FRITZ GANNON, Helena, Montana, contributes all of the teasers
in this number:

    (20)	A car-checker has a string of seven cars, each containing a
number consisting of six figures. After entering down the numbers, he
is surprised to find that not only do the numbers of the first six cars
contain the same figures, but he also notices that the number on the
second car is twice as great; that of the third, three times as great;
that of the fourth, four times as great; that of the fifth, five times as
great; and that of the sixth, six times as great as the number on the
first car he checked. The seventh car has a number, containing none of
the figures to be found on the other six, yet the number on the seventh
car is seven times as great as that on the first. What were the numbers
on the cars?

    (21)	A conductor in making up a freight-train has to cut out a
certain number of cars from three tracks. Ke finds that there are 10
more cars on Track No. 2 than on No. 1, and 10 more on No. 3, than
on No. 2. He cuts out from No. 1, one-half the cars, and a half a car
besides. From No. 2, he cuts out one-fourth the cars, and a fourth of a
car besides. From No. 3, he cuts out one-sixth of the cars and a sixth
of a car besides. After doing so, there are ten more cars on Track No. 3
than on No. 2, and ten more on No. 2 than on No. 1. How many cars
were there at first on each of thy three tracks?

    (22)	A section-foreman, being asked by a passing hobo the time
of day, replied : " The days are now sixteen hours long, and when as
much time has passed as has already passed since the hands of my watch
were last together, the sun will have just done two-thirds of its shining
to-day." Assuming that the sun rose at 4 a.m., that day, what time was
it when the foreman made the above statement?

     The correct answers to the above puzzles will be found in the April
number. -	_

        Where We Get Flagged by Our Readers, and
        Find' an Exhaust for Our Own High Pressure.

OUR running-orders for April arc ready. They
look pretty good to us. When we say this,
we mean that they are a little better than any
running-orders we have had at any previous time
and for any previous run.

  Scanning the sheet, we find that three new
serials will start with April. They are just as
intense and gripping in their way as those which
close with this number—thwre are no blocks
caused by washouts or broken rails; no leaky
joints or broken valve-stems—but a clear track
all the way.

 The first serial is ‘‘The Thousand-Mile
Ticket,” by Dan Duane, which introduces a
character somewhat similar in bravado, fearless-
ness. and adventure to Seth Waters, who made the
chapters of '' In the Hornet's Nest " so interesting.

  “ Baker of the Bad Lands " is by Walter T. Per-
cival. a writer whom we are introducing for the
first time. It is a story that deals-with stirring ad-
ventures of border life, of a time when it took
more than grit and force to build a railroad.

  C. W. Beels, who has contributed a number of
clever short stories to our pages, will appear with
his first serial. It is called "Dr. Jourdans Mys-
tery," ami deals with the remarkable transforma-
tion of a man who was destined to be a crook.

  There will be another thrilling story of frontier
life by R. M. West, whose narrative, “ A Frontier
Man-Hunt,” appears in this number. All of Mr.
West’s stories are based on real happenings and
are truthful pictures of the most romantic days
in the building of our West.

  The latest development in locomotives and
other important phases of railroad life, will be
described by one of our most practical writers.

  Walter Gardner Seaver will be aboard with
an unusually good batch of roundhouse tales.

  Another particularly interesting article will tell
of the struggles of the first builders of the rail-
road—of the days when George Stephenson was
trying to make his wonderful invention prove its
worth. This article will relate the court proceed-
ings of a suit brought by certain canal owners
and landed proprietors of Great Britain to pre-
vent the construction of a railroad. One of the
most learned lawyers on the opposing side told
Mr. Stephenson that it was impossible to run a
train through a tunnel because the snow would
blow into the tunnel, turn to ice and thereby block
the train's progress!

  Wliat do you think of that?

  The buffer aifd the vestibule arc important
parts of every train. They have a history of their
own like all other railroad improvements. Their
importance is described in this number.

  In “ Ten Thousand Miles by Rail,” Gilson
Willets will take a jump from Missouri through
the Sun Flower State, where he collected a num-
ber of good yarns.

  These are only a few of the special features
that we care to mention just now. We reserve
the right to start up a few genuine surprises.

  In the short fiction line, there will be nine or
ten stories of the sort for which The Railroad
Max's Magazine is famous. We wish to state,
with our accustomed modesty, that I he short
stories we are printing are attracting more than
ordinary attention. We always believed they
would. They are selected with the greatest care,
and represent phases of life that thrill with energy,
life, determination, and humor, such as no other
magazine can present.

   In April, the experiences of our friends. ‘‘ Honk
and Horace” in Oklahoma, are told in Mr, Em-
met F. Harte’s best vein. Robert Fulkerson
Hoffman has just completed -a new story in his
most delightful style, which, we will present.
Augustus Wittfeld, MacDuffie Martin. Felix G.
Prentice, George Foxhall, and others, will be in
evidence.

  In short, our April number will be a corker.
We are not trying to blow off while hot, about its
excellence. There are no cracked sheets or broken
stay-bolts—the water in the gage-glass of our
hopes is fluctuating with the water-line in the
boiler of our energy, and it looks as if we have
a good run ahead of us.

THE RAILROAD CLUBS.

SURPRISE has many times been expressed
that more real benefit to the railroads of this
country has not been obtained through the or-
ganized railroad clubs located in the principal
railroad centers throughout America, says the
American Engineer and Railroad Journal. While,
of course, all of these clubs are of more or less
value to their members, this becomes insignificant
when il is considered what they might be. not only
to their own members, but also to the members
of all other clubs. Here is really a clearing-
house for the observations and experiences of the

379
380

THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.

• t

best men in the country, already organized, from
which not one-tenth part of their value is avail-
able for general use.

  Mr. C. E. Turner several years ago suggested
that all of the clubs throughout the country dis-
cuss the same subject at corresponding meetings.
Mr. Vaughan in bis presidential address before
the Master Mechanics’ Association, in 1909, sug-
gested that the railroad clubs should be depended
upon to thoroughly thrash out the subjects which
were to come before the Association, so diat de-
cisive and positive conclusions could be reached
on the various important subjects that were
brought up.

  Both of these suggestions are excellent, and it
is now further suggested that all of the clubs
affiliate info one organization, and that a perma-
nent secretary, provided with suitable office-force
and properly recompensed, be employed. Further,
that the American Railway Association be re-
quested to name a, consulting board, who should
decide w hat subjects are most worthy of discus-
sion, and that the permanent secretary, through
the medium of the local secretaries, obtain papers
to be presented by each of the various clubs on
this subject, where it could be thoroughly and
completely discussed. The papets. with the dis-
cussion. should be returned to the permanent
secretary, who would condense them and put the
•whole matter into suitable shape for publication
and for the use of the committee who might be
preparing a report on the same subject for one
of the National Associations.

  This suggestion, while capable of criticism on
.a number of points, and possibly not suitable for
adoption in its entirety, still has many points
of practicability, and if something of this kind
could be brought about, the proceedings of the
Associated Railroad Clubs of America would be
the most valuable source of information on rail-
road topics that could possibly be compiled, and
with the certainty assured of results which in
prospect are now largely speculative

 THE RIDDLE OF THE CROSS-HEAD

SINCE publication of the reply to “ E T ,"
-Southampton, Long Island, in “ By the Light
of the Lantern ” for January, we have received a
number of critical, though kindly, letters inte/ided
to straighten out our interpretation of the so-
called cross-h?ad problem. We have been greatly
pleased to receive these communications, because
all .evince a friendly and appreciative interest in
1his popular department on which we have worked
untiringly to perfect. We do not object to a “ call
down” when you think that you have it on us.
no matter whether, as in this case, the shoe scarce-
ly happens to fit

  The cross-head question, as originally pro-
pounded. to the best of our recollection, ran as
follows:

  “ Does the cross-head of a locomotive move

backward in the guides, or do the guides move,
forward over the cross-head?"

  We replied that the cross-head did move back-
ward in the guides, which it does, irrespective of
the fact that it must be necessarily earned always
ahead, provided that the locomotive is running
forward.

  To make this entirely Xlear, the answer in the
January “ Lantern ’’ department was based on a
consideration of the relation between the cross-
head and the locomotive which carries it, and with
no consideration of the relation between the cross-
bead and some fixed point foreign to the locomo-
tive. as, for instance, the ground or the rail.

  Xo such connection, however, was suggested in
the correspondent's letter. Under the conditions
mentioned, the reply as given is absolutely correct.
It now appears that this time-honored query,
which is largely a trick, must not take into ac-
count the relation of the cross-head to the guides,
but to the rail or ground.

  It does not require labored diagrams and lengthy
explanations to prove that no matter in which di-
rection the cross-head may be moving, it can never
return to a point over the rail where it may have
been before. This can be shown by the most ele-
mentary application of simple algebra, but before
proceeding with the demonstration we would like
to impress that the cross-head does not move any-
where except back and forth in the guides, as we
said in January.

  Its movement in the direction in which the
locomotive is going is simply because it is carried
along with the locomotive of which it is, with its
guides, a component part

  Assuming:

Diameter of driving-wheel	= x

Stroke of piston	= y

Circumference of driving-wheel = ~ x

  On the lower half of one revolution going for-
ward the locomotive moves forward in relation to

the rail a distance =	At the same time the

cross-head moves backward, relative to the guides,
a distance = y. At the same time, the cross-
head is also curried forward, relative to the rail,
a distance = y. When on this half of the stroke
the cross-head is curried forward, relative to the

rail, a distance =	_ y.

  On the other (upper) half of the revolution, the
locomotive moves forward the same distance
= !LX' and the cross-head moves forward rela-
tive to the guides, a distance = y. Then, on
this half of the stroke the cross-head is carried for-
ward, relative to the rail, a distance = - x v.

                       2 J

  Taking the entire strokes (revolution) to-
gether. we find that the locomotive has moved for-
ward. relative to the rail, a distance = “x, and that
the cross-head has been carried forward relative to
the rail, a distance = —y)	- y) = Tx,

or the same as the locomotive, q.c.d.

  The long and short of it is, that the cross-head

goes regularly back and forth in the guides, but
while all this is going on it is being carried
ahead with its guides by the locomotive to which
they are attached. It might be roughly illustrated
by a ball thrown between two men on either end
of a flat car in motion. The ball moves back and
forth between the men but it can never return to
a point in relation to the track which it has once
left.

. We feel impelled to quote a sentence from one-
letter of those received on this matter: “In
your answer you claim that it (the cross-head)
moves backward, which it does not. and at no
time docs it stand still.”

  For the benefit of this particular correspondent,
\ye want to demonstrate how easily the cross-head
might stand still 'if proper proportions or dimen-
sions were present. He may be surprised to know
that such diameter of wheel and such length of
stroke can be assumed as to make _ y = o,
j. e: that the cross-head under such assumption
is actually stationary in relation to the rail for
the upper half of the stroke.

  Example:

        Let x = 20.

        Let y = 31.4.

       Then “x = 3.1416 x 20 = 62.83.

      Then 14-31 4.

       And 'LiS — y = o.

  Although we could not use any of the diagrams
and explanatory matter which several correspond-
ents kindly sent with their letters, we are grateful
for them, because they establish that in the cross-
head problem the rail or ground is the point to
be considered. Had the original question con-
tained this information we would have proceeded
long ago with the simple explanation as above;
but in view of this omission, our answer was pos-
sibly not as elaborate and satisfying as it might
have been.

FUEL OIL IN THE NORTHWEST.

AS soon as locomotives of the Northern Pacific
and the Tacoma Eastern railroadsjn Wes-
tern Washington can be equipped with oil-burners,
all engines on the main lines traversing the forest
sections of the State will be using oil instead of
coal, thereby eliminating one of the greatest
dangers from forest fires.

  President Williams of the Chicago, Milwaukee
and Puget Sound, announces that the Tacoma
Eastern locomotives will be equipped with oil-
burners early next spring. The Tacoma Eastern
runs through a great virgin forest, part within
the Rainier National forest and part owned by
private corporations.

  All the other Milwaukee lines running through
the forests arc already equipped with oil-burners.
The Oregon-Washington Railroad and Naviga-
tion Company and the Great Northern railways

now use California oil as fuel where their lines
penetrate the forests. The Northern Pacific is
making preliminary investigations with a view to
making the same changes on the west end of the

system.

THE PREVENTION OF SMOKE.

THE comparative absence of smoke in Berlin
is claimed to be due partly to the use of fuel
briquettes. Consul General A. W. Thackara
stales that 30 per cent of the coal-fuel consumed
in the city and suburbs is brown coal briquettes,
and it has been technically demonstrated that,
having been produced without the addition of
a special binder, they burn with less smoke than
any other briquettes. Considerable coke is also
used in Berlin.

  The quantity of coal briquettes produced in
Germany increased from 9,250,000 tons in 1901
to about 16,300,000 tons in 1907 and to IS,000,-

000	tons in 1910. Consul Albert Halstead, of
Birmingham, reports that the manufacture of
coal briquettes has become a large industry in the
United Kingdom.

  Official figures show that in 1909 the produc-
tion for the whole Kingdom was 1,512,645 long
tons, valued at $4,761,860, This output was di-
vided: England, 177,895 tons, valued at $569,-
071; Wales, 1,270,235 tons, valued at $3,948,591;
Scotland, 43,620 tons, valued at $144,885; arid
Ireland, 20,895 tons, valued at $100,313. The
values given represent the selling-price at the
place of manufacture.

A NEW RAILROAD POET.

RAILROAD men in the Northern Pacific
yards at St. Paul, Minnesota, often stop to
look at a smooth-shaven, slender young switch-
man who has endeared himself to them through
short bits of poetry written during his idle mo-
ments. Not infrequently is C. G Byrne seen
perched on top of a box car, pencil in hand,
writing on a scrap of paper. When lie has fin-
ished. there is always this request, “ Let me see,
Byrne.” Some of his productions are worthy of
attention.

  Not long ago, Roger, the little son of the switch-
man, was ill. The doctor had given up hope of
saving the boy’s life. Sitting at home that night,
the father saw the boy’s engine—a bright toy—
idle on the playroom floor. He drew a paper from
his pocket and wrote the touching verses, “ The
Dead Engine," which appear on page 280 of
this number.

 ANSWERS TO CERTAIN SIGNALS.

WL. S., Biggs, Pennsylvania.—It is really
• impossible for us to print in this issue
the names and addresses of the road-foremen,
mechanical engineers, and master mechanics of
all the roads given in your letter. They would
take up too much space. Simply address the
general master mechanic or any other officer of
the road in question, and the letter will reach
the right man. It is not necessary to have his
name.

  R. C. S., Operator, Manchester, Oklahoma.—
Thanks for your verses "Oh, Vou Telephone!”
Would like to use them, but we have decided not
to stir up any more strife on this subject.

  K. K., and others.—" Honk and Horace ” be-
gan their doin's in Thf. Railroad Man's Maga-
zine in November, 1908. Vou can secure back
numbers by sending ten cents per copy to this
office. Yes, " Honk and Horace ” will be with us
for some time to come. They have a pass over
all our lines—notwithstanding the Hepburn Law.

FROM A “LADY HAM.”

Editor, The Railroad Max's Magazine:

IF you will permit, I would like to say a few
words regarding despatching by telephone.

    I have just read Operator Naugle’s little
“ spiel " in the January magazine. T agree with
him. There is not an operator in the United
States who likes the telephone. Why? Surely
there is a reason. In the first place, the " tick-
tick” of the sounder is the sweetest music an
operator ever heard. Silence the sounder and the
operator is lonesome and wonders if the wire is
down, if his instrument is out of adjustment, or
what. Immediately he will seek the trouble.

  A telephone-operator never knows where the
trains arc, if they are gaining or losing time, or
what trains are coming and going, unless he sits
with that harness on his head; and who wants
to sit hours and hours listening to the other ope-
rators and “hams” repeat orders?

  In the first place, an operator has loo many
other duties to devote all his time to the phone.
He can be selling tickets, posting the books, and
numerous other duties, and still keep tab on all
the trains.

  Some contend that the phone is faster than
telegraphing. Possibly it is; at least, a despatcher
can talk fastc-r than he can send, but an operator
cannot copy any faster from the telephone. He
can write just so fast and no faster, no matter
how' rapidly the despatcher talks.

  Another thing, it is impossible to copy as far
behind on the phone as you can by telegraph. I
have to keep right up with the despatcher, else
I lose out. I have heard several say the same
thing.

  How many operators who have copied and de-
livered orders that had been despatched by phone
felt as confident as if the message had come by
telegraph?

  Ask the conductors, and they will tell you they
don't like to run on orders, despatched oyer a
phone. During the past month, several have told
me they were afraid of phone-orders. I must
confess. I'm afraid of them, too. and I h'ave never
delivered an order that had bec-n despatched by
phone when I wasn’t uneasy.

  The telephone will never mean to the operators
what the Morse does, and I see where railroad-
ing is fast losing^its charm for me as well as
for thousands of others. No matter how big a
“ ham ” you may be, you are willing to keep on
struggling rather than have the phones to con-
tend with. Am a full-fledged “ ham ” myself,
but I am not willing to work on the phones. I
much prefer working on some road where there
are no phones, for half the salary.

  If the phone is to succeed the Morse, twenty-
five years from to-day there will be no operators
except those in commercial office^. Any one can
sit downyand, in an hour or two, learn the book of
rules, pass the examination, and walk down and
tell us old experienced railroaders where to “ head
in.” What protection have we? None whatever.

BLASTS AND ORDERS.

Editor, The Railroad Man’s Magazine :

IN your February number, you tell L. E., Gar-
ber. Missouri, that you do not know of any
■ such signal as three short blasts of the engine-
whistle. Perhaps it is not in use on all roads,
but on our lines here it is ,used.

  When the conductor of a passenger-train wants
the train stopped at the next station, which is in
all probability a flag-stop, be gives the engineer
three short blasts on the air-signal whistle. The
engineer answers this by three short blasts of the
engine-whistle.

  L. E. also asks. "Is it safe for an operator to
recopy train-orders? ”

  Here on the Pennsy, we sometimes overlook
our copies. In such an event, we lay the original

copy over some blank orders, and trace them from
the original. When we do this, we repeat the
recopied order to I he despatches and have him
“ O. K." it.—An Operator, Bellaire, Ohio.

Editor, The Railroad Max's Magazine:

IN’ regard to G. F. B.'s letter on the use of fer-
rules in putting in boiler-flues, in your-Janu-
ary number. I want to say that I have pul in
a few Hues, part of them for Uncle Sam. and 1
never waste time on ferrules. I have never had
a fiue-leak develop in my flue-work. I simply
put in the flue and “ roll " it well, but not too
hard. Even “ beading" is not essential to a
tight joint, but is usually put on “ for looks.’’

No—ferrules are absolutely superfluous. Put-
ting them on is work thrown away.—E. M. F.,

LOOKING FORWARD.

THIS is the Vay that they looked at it, boys,
way back in 1789, when Dr. Darwin’s
“ Botanic Garden" was first published after
twenty years of constant labor ott the part of
the author. They certainly looked on steam with
some awe in those days:

Soon s.hall thy arm, uhconquered steam, afar
Drag the slow barge, or drive the rapid car;

Or, on wide-waving wings expanded bear
The flying chariot through the fields of air.

Fair crews, triumphant, leaning from above,

Shall wave their fluttering ’kerchiefs as they move;
Or warrior bands alarm the gaping crowd,

And armies shrink beneath the shadowy cloud ;

So mighty Hercules o'er many a clime
Waved his huge mace in virtue’s cause sublime;
Unmeasured strength with early art combined,
Awed, served, protected, and amazed mankind.

OLD-TIME POEMS.

MR. J. W. WOOD, of Muskogee, Oklahoma,
has sent us several noted railroad classics,
which have already appeared in The Carpel. He
sends us another, ‘‘The Engineer's Story,” which
we append herewith. Again, our thanks to Mr.
Wood.

     THE ENGINEER’S STORY.

WELL, yes, 'tis a hair-curlin’ story—

I would it could not be recalled!

        The terrible fright of that hell-tinctured
            night.

Is the causc of my head bein' bald !

I was runnin’ the Git-There Express, sir,

On the Yankee Creek jenkwater line,

An’ the track along there was as crooked. I swear,
As the growth of a field pumpkin-vine.

My run was a night one, an’ nights on the yank
Was as black as the coal piled back there on the
lank.

We pulled out of Tenderfoot Station,

A day and a half, almost, late.

An' every durn wheel was a poundin' the steel

At a wildly extravagant rate.	—

My fireman kep’ piling the coal in
The jaws of the old 94

Till the sweat from his nose, seemed lo play
    through a hose,

An’ splashed ’round his feet on the floor
As we thundered along like a demon in flight,

 A rippin' a streak through the breast of the night!

As we rounded a curve on the mountain.

 Full sixty an hour, I will swear.

Just ahead was a sight that with blood-freezin'
    flight

Would have raised a stuffed buffalo’s hair!

The bridge over Ute Creek was burnin',

The flames shootin' up in their glee!

My God! how they gleamed in the air, till they
    seemed

Like fiery tongued imps on a spree!

Jest snickered an''sparkled an’ laughed like they
     knowed

I’d make my next trip on a different road!

 In frenzy I reached for the throttle.

But ’twas stuck, and refused to obey!

1 yelled in affright, for our maddening flight
I felt that I never could stay!

Then wildly I grasped the big lever,

Threw her over, then held my hot breath,

An’ waited for what I assuredly thought
Was a sure and a terrible death !

Then came the wild crash, an' with horror-fringed
     yell

Down into that great fiery chasm I fell!

When I came to myself. I was lying
On the floor of my bedroom; my wife
Sat on top of my form, an' was makin’ it warm
For her darling—you bet your sweet life!

My hair she had clutched in her fingers,

And was jamming my head on the floor;

Yet I yelled with delight when I found that my
    fright

Was a horrible dream—nothing more!

 1 had wildly grabbed one of her ankles, she said.
 And reversed her clear over the head of the bed!

OX THE FRONTIER.

By I. Edgar Jones.

HAT! Robbed the mail at midnight! We’ll
    trail them down, you bet !

We'll bring them to the halter; I’m sheriff
     of Yuba yet.

Get out those mustangs, hearties, and long before
     set of sun

We'll trail them down to their refuge, and justice
     shall yet be done.

It's pleasant, this rude experience: life has a
    rugged zest

Here on the plains anil mountains, far to the open
     West:

Look at those snow-capped summits—waves of
    an endless sea;

Look at yon billowed prairie—boundless as grand
    and free.

All, we have found our quarry, yonder within the
    bush!

Empty your carbines at them, then follow me with
    a rush!
384

THE RAILROAD MAN’S MAGAZINE.

Down, with ilie desperadoes! Ours is the cause
    of right!

Though they should slash like demons, still we
    must gain the fight!

Pretty hot work, McGregor; but we have gained
    the day.

What? Have we lost their leader? Can he have
    sneaked away ?

There he goes in the chaparral! Hell reach it
    now in a bound !

Give me that rifle, Parker! I’ll bring him down
    to the ground.

Thc-re! I knew I could drop him—that little
    piece of lead

Sped straight on to its duty. The last of the gang
    is dead.

Hi- was a handsome fellow, plucky and fearless,
    too.

Pity such men are devils, preying 011 those more
    true.

What have you found in his pocket? -Capers?
    Let's take a look.

" George Walgrave ” stamped -on the cover ? Why,
    that is my brother's book ;

The deeds and the papers, also, and letters re-
    ceived from me;

He must have met these demons—been murdered
    and robbed, you see.

And I have been his avenger! It is years since
    last we met.

We loved each other dearly, and Walgraves never
    forget.

If my voice is broken, excuse me. Somehow it
    confines my breath—

Let me look on the face of that demon who dogged
    poor George to his death!

Good God! It is he—my brother—killed by ray
    own strong hand!

He is no bandit leader! This is 110 robber band!

What.a mad, murderous blunder! Friends, who
    thought they were foes.

Seven- men dead on the prairie, and seven homes
    flooded with woes.

And to think that I should have done it! When
    ere many suns should set,

I	hoped to pmbrace my brother—and this is the
    way we’ve met!

He with his dead eyes gazing up to the distant sky.

And T. his murderer, standing, living and un-
    harmed. by!

Well, his fate is the best one! Mine, to behold
    his corse.

Haunting my life forever—doomed to a vain
    remorse.

How shall I bear its shadows? How could this
    strange thing he?

Oh, my brother ;fnd playmate! Would I had
    died for thee! .

Pardon my weak emotion. Bury them here, my
    friends:

Here, where the green-plumed willow over the
    prairie bends.

One more tragedy finished, in the romance of
    strife,

Passing like somber shadows over this frontier
     life.

 CONDUCTOR BRADLEY.

 By John Greenleaf Whither.

ONDLCTOR BRADLEY (always may his
   name

Be said with reverence!), as the swift doom
     came,

Smitten 10 death, a crushed and mangled frame.

Sank with the brake he grasped just where he
    stood

To do the utmost that a brave man could,

And die, if needful, as a true man should.

Men stooped above him; women dropped their
    tears

On that poor wreck beyond all hopes or fears,
Lost in the strength and glory of his years.

What heard they? Lo, the ghastly lips of pain.
Dead to all thought save duty's, moved again:

“ Put out the signals for the ocher train ! ”

No nobler utterance, since the world began.
From lips of.saint or martyr ever ran,

Electric, through the sympathies of man.

Ah, me! how poor and noteless seem to this
The sick-bed dramas of self-consciousness,

Our sensual fears of pain and hopes of bliss!

Oh, grand, supreme endeavor! Not in vain
That last brave act of failing tongue and brain !
Freighted with life, the downward-rushing train

Following the wrecked one as wave follows wave.
Obeyed the warning which the dead lips gave.
Others he saved—himself he could not save.

Nay, the lost life was saved. He is not dead
Who in his record still the earth shall tread.

With God's clear aureole shining round his head.

We bow, as in the dust, with all our pride
Of virtue dwarfed the noble deed beside.

God give us grace to live as Bradley died!

A BAD COUPLING.

    SHE married a railroad man,

     A locomotive spark;

     He told her of his little plan
     At the gate, out in the dark.

But long ere a year had gone,

     The fire it died alack!

    Their coupling apart was drawn
    And he switched her off his track!

Where Minutes
Mean Miles

   A minute’s a minute to most men. But
 minutes mean miles to you men on the road.
 A minute slow or a minute fast and you may-
 be a mile behind or a mile ahead of your
 schedule.

   We’ve made a watch that measures those
 miles to perfection. It is a South Bend
 Watch called "The Studebaker.”

   Six months are spent just in making and
 putting the parts together. Another six
 months are required to bring this watch to
 its marvelous accuracy. A full year on one
 watch is not uncommon, but the watch is
 uncommon when it is finished.

 \ Sixty different men each contributes his
 skill in its making. Each watch gets over
 four hundred inspections. Each must run
 continuously for thirty days and nights and
 'keep accurate time or it isn’t sent out.

   No other watch in the world can compare
 with it.

   See “The Studebaker” at your jeweler’s.
 Only first-class jewelers sell it. Such
 jewelers can give it the "personal
 adjustment” that every good
 watch needs.

          ■i

   The way you carry a watch
 affects it. The man who sits at
 the throttle subjects his watch
 to the jars and jolts occasioned by the
 rocking of the locomotive—the man who

 supplies the steam is continually leaning
 backward and forward, keeping his fire at
 the right point—the man who carries the
 lantern is constantly jumping on and off
 the train and hurrying to and fro—each of
 these men subjects a watch to entirely dif-
 ferent treatment and his watch must be
 one that can be regulated to offset the
 conditions under which it is carried.

 “The Studebaker” can be so regulated.

 Go to your jeweler and get “The Stude-
 baker”—the watch which has met the most
 exacting railroad requirements.

 “The Studebaker” is made with 17 and
 21 jewels and costs only a trifle more than
 common watches.

A LIVING FROM POULTRY

Note the condition of them* three nmnilis old pullets. These pullets and their ancestor for seten

you that we have actually
done a $1500 poultry bus-
iness with 60 hens on a
corner in the city garden 40
feet wide by 40 feet long,
we are simply stating facts.
It would not be possible to

am' in many respects just the reverse, accomplishing things in poultry work
that have always been coneldeied impossible, and getting unheard-of results
that are hard t<> believe without seeing.

THE NEW SYSTEM COVERS ALL BRANCHES OP THE WORK
NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS

from selecting the breeders to marketing the product. It tells how to 2<‘t egg*
that will hatch, how to hatch nearly every egg and how to raise nearly all the
chicks batched. It gives complete plans iu derail how to make everything
necessary to run the business and at less than half the rout required to handle
the poultry business in any other manner.

TWO-POUND BROILERS IN EIGHT WEEKS

are raised in a - pace of less than a square foot to the broiler, and the broiler*
are nfthe very beat quality, bringing here 3 cents a pound above tne highest

tion l- fed, and tne food used is inexpensive as compared with foo l other*

particulars regarding these wonderful diat.-ovci-ies, with simple, easy-to-
uuderstand directions that are iiiiht (<• the point, ami I.', paxes of I.lustra-
tions showing all branches of the work from start to Hnlsli.

DON'T LET THE CHICKS DIE IN THE SHELL

   Ore of the secrets of success is to save all the chickens that are fully de-
veloped at hatching time, whether they can crack the shell or not. It Is t
simple trick, and believed to be the secret of ihe ancient Egyptians and
Chinese which enabled them to sell the chicks at 10 cents a dozen.

CHICKEN FEED AT FIFTEEN CENTS A BUSHEL

Our book tells how to make the best green food with but little trouble and
have a good supply any day in the year, winter or summer. It is just as

impossible to set a large egg yield without irreeu food as It Is to keep a cow
without hay or fodder.

OUR NEW BROODER SAVES 2 CENTS ON EACH CHICKEN

No lamp required. No danrer of chilling, over-heating or burning up th«
chickens as with brooders usin; lamps or any kind o| tire. They also keep th*

TESTIMONIALS

My Dkar Mr. Piiii.o : -	Valley Falls. N. Y., Oct. 1, 1910.

After another year's work with your System of Poultry Keeping (making
threa 'ears iu all) I am thoroughly convinced of its practicability. I raise I
all my chicks in your Brooder-Coops containing your Fireless Brooders, and
kept them there until the} were nearly matured, decreasing the number in
each coop, however, as they grew In size. Those who have visited my plant
have been unanimous in their praise of my birds raised by this System.

Sincerely yours,	iRev ) E. B. Tcmpler.

Mr. E. K. Phii.o, Elmira, N. Y.	Elmira, N. Y., Oct. SO, 1909.

Dear Sir :—No doubt ■ ■ >n will be Interested to learn of our success in keep-
ing poultry by the Philo System. Our first year’s work is now nearly com-
pleted. Il has given us an income of over $500.CO from six pedigree hens and
one cockerel. Had we understood the work as well as we now do after a
year's experience, we could easily have made over $1000.00 from the six liens.
In addition to ihe profits from the sale of pedigree chicks we have cleared
over $000.00, running our Hatchery plant, consisting of 56 Cycle Hatchers. \V->
are pleased with the results, and expect to do better the coming year. Wit.,
best wishes, we are	Very truly yours, Mrs.) C. P. Goodrich.

Mr E. R Phii.o, Elmira, N. Y.	South Britain, Conn., April 19. 1909

Dear Sir:—I have followed your System as close as I could : ihe result is x
complete success. If there can he any improvement on nature, your brooder
is it. The first experience I had with your System was last December. I
batched 17 chicks under two hens, put them as soon as hatched in one <»f
your brooders out of doors, ami at the age of three mouths I sold them at 3.*>r.
a pound. They then averaged 2^ lbs. each, and the man I sold them to said
they were the finest he ever saw. and he wants all I can spare this s-ason.

                              Yours truly,	A. E. Nelson.

" We Make'Tour Dreams of HomeComeTrue

V, ,

  We have made the dreams of home
come true for over 600,000 people, in every
community and in every walk of life; from
the humble cottage to the pretentious
mansion, from the smallest hamlet to the largest city, the Spiegel, May, Stern Com-
pany has been making happy homes for over half a century.

   Rich and poor alike have been extended exactly the same terms, exactly the same low prices. There
has been no favoritism shown—everybody gets the same liberal, generous treatment. And there isn’t any
magic about our way of doing business. Just a simple business proposition that has been wonderfully
successful and which has built up during the last century the greatest business of its kind in the world.

Everything Shown in Our Home-Lovers* Bargain Book is
an Unusual Bargain—Bought at Tremendous Reduction.
No Extra Price if You Wish to Pay as Convenient.

3,000 Bargains in Furniture, Carpets, Rugs, Stoves, Ranges, Draperies, Chinaware,
Silverware, Sewing Machines, Washing Machines, Lamps,Clocks, Baby Carriages, etc.

   We sell at cash factory prices. No middlemen, no jobbers, no dealers —all these expenses
and profits are cut out entirely. We sell from the factory direct to you by means of this catalog
only. This is essentially a book of bargains. We are always in the market with plenty of money
to take advantage of every possible bargain that is offered. We snap up everything in sight if we
can get it at the right price, and we give you the advantage of our quantity-buying, adding only
one small profit. We guarantee a saving under prices quoted by any mail order house or by dealers
of 15 to 50 per cent. And if it is not convenient to pay cash you may buy on our liberal open account
credit plan at the same prices as if you pay cash. No other concern in America does that. We are
going to prove that to you, as we have to over 600,000 people.

home for a month before anything more is due.

    If they are not satisfactory—not cheaper Ilian anywhere else—you return
them at our expense. Every penny you have paid, including the freight
charges, will then be returned to you.

Union Increases Use

  When two groups of telephone
subscribers are joined together the
usefulness of each telephone is
increased.

  Take the simplest case — two
groups, each with three subscribers.
As separate groups there are pos-
sible only six combinations—only
six lines of communication. Unite
these same two groups, and instead
of only six, there will be fifteen
lines of communication.

  No matter how the groups are
located or how they are connected
by exchanges, combination in-

creases the usefulness of each tele-
phone, it multiplies traffic, it
expands trade.

  The increase is in accordance
with the mathematical rule. If two
groups of a thousand each are
united, there will be a million more
lines of communication.

  No one subscriber can use all of
these increased possibilities, but
each subscriber uses some of them.

  Many groups of telephone sub-
scribers have been united in theBell
System to increase the usefulness of
each telephone, and meet the pub-
lic demand for universal service.

        Bathe Daily with
           Fairy Soap	^1

    The daity bath is worth all the squills and pills
in the world, but half its benefit and enjoyment
depends on the purity of the soap used.

Fairy Soap is just as pure as its whiteness would lead
you to believe—because it is made from edible pro-
ducts, and has no coloring matter, dyes or high
perfumes to deceive the eye, or delude the sense
of smell.

Its floating properties, handy, oval shape
and price of 5c leave nothing to be
desired.

Healthy Folks

     Can be comfortable in any kind of weather. But to be healthy, the blood
     must circulate freely from the heels to the top of head. No person can keep
     warm and feel good unless it does.

     Many coffee drinkers shrink from weather a little above or below normal.
     Coffee has a tendency to congest the liver and more or less weaken the heart
     action, which, of course, interferes seriously with the circulation of the blood,
     and a variety of disorders may reasonably be expected to follow.

     It seems that a little common sense impels anyone unpleasantly affected by
     coffee to quit it.

     To such we present the facts about
