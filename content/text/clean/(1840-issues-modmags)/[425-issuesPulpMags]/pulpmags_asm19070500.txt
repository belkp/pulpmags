CHAPTER I.

THE WAXDEJUtR RETURNED.

WHAT! **

 Dr. Sheldon readjusted his
 glasses an d took another arid
 more prolonged look at the
 card in his hand.

“ Henry £. Randall.' " he cried, more

softly. “ Well. Ill be--

 Jest there he stopped, for the maid
 was watching him with slightly elevated
 eyebrows. She was a very prim and
 satisfactory maid, too, and there seemed
 no use risking her nerves by the undue
 use of joyous profanity. Therefore, the
 doctor concluded:

 “ Well, tell him to come right in.
 Helen.”

" There are two geodemen in the
waiting-room. sir. They've been there
ten or fifteen minutes."

 “ Eh? " The doctor had jost come up
 from a late breakfast. “ Nothing the
 matter with them, apparently? "

“ No, sir, bet they gave me their

cards, and-"

 “ All right. Bring 'em in when Mr.
 Randall leaves, then." Sheldon ordered.
 “■ He won't be here long. Show him in."

 Two minutes later he dropped Ran-
 dall’s hand with a final grip and re-
 turned to his chair with an approving
 grin.

 “ So you're actually back at last, and
 as suddenly and unexpectedly as you left,
 Henry' ” be said. “ Sit down.”

 “ WelL I only dropped in for a mo-
 ment." Randall hesitated “ There's
 some one ahead of me. the maid said.

 “ Sit down ’ "

  “ About that." Randall laughed.
“Yes. a jaunt around the world is a bit
cf a freshener, Tom. I've made pretty
certain of that.”

  “ Just where did you go ? "

  “ From here to England." Randall
soiled. “ From England to South
Africa. From there to Holland—to
England—and home again 1r'

  ’■ And yon landed? "

  “ Last night.” said Randall. “Hew
has the world been treating you? Kill-
ing off the population as successfully as
ever? "

  Sheldon did not answer immediately.
He' locked steadily at the other, and a
strong light cf curiosity came into his
eyes.

  “ Did you—get it ? ” he said softly.

  “ The—the diamond I went after? "
Randall started slightly and lowered his
voice. ■' I—why. of coarse."

  Randall merely soiled oddly, nodded,
and remained silent. The doctor pursed
his lips, and just the slightest hint of
a frown appeared.

  “ Henry." he said, in low tones,

v. and you know that I'm nt given to

    Twenty-four years! " Sheldon an-
ounced. “ Hand out the tale. Henry,
and end the suspense! ”

  '■ Well, all right.” Randall glanced
toward the door and drew his chair to
the doctor's side. “ I'll put it in half a
dozen words, then, and skip on cfc-wn-
town. Tom. It’s not an overwhelming
mystery, you know."

  One hand wen* with a queer furtive
motion toward his left armpit. Rar.da'.l
drew breath and began:

For a stan. just three days before
I saw you last a gentleman by the name
of Gardner was ushered into my private
oSce in the jewelry store, down-town.”
'■ WlSch Gardner? "

  “ P. E.”

  " Phew: " Sheldon opened his eyes.
“ The one with the large, large bank-
account, eh? ”

  “ Yes, the millionaire. Well, he closed
the door and sat down, and informed me
that he had done business with my father
in the same store thirty years agj; that
he understood I had inherited the sti re
and was carrying on business as usual,
and that he believed I was one of the
diamond experts of New York. I in-
timated that he had pretty nearly hit the
nail on the head, and invited him to pro-
ceed.

  “ He did. A year ago next month,
you know, he married Miss Marjorie
Pelton. the society beauty, a lady about a
quarter of a century younger than him-
self. He’s pretty well convinced that the

sun rises and sets for her especial benefit,

and rice vtrsa.

  " At any rate, he wished to make her

a little gift on the first anniversary of
their marriage, and he wanted to prepare
for it ahead of time. In short, he wished
to M'i'.sult me about obtaining the largest

I ssible single diamond." *

  “ Aha! ” observed Sheldon.

  “ Well. I’ve been digging a pretty fair
profit out of New York’s fashionable
set." Randall chuckled, “ but I can tell
yon, my heart wanned to that son of
customer. I ran over several stones that
I had in mind, for his benefit.

  “ There was one perfect peach of a
diamond I could have bought for about
twenty thousand, and another that forty-
five might have taken ; and—er, some-
where within a dozen miles—there is a
perfect old-fashioned bouncer that might
be acquired for eighty-five or ninety
thousand dollars:"

  “ Great Scott • ”

  “ That was what I thought he’d say.
but he didn't. Gardner’s a good spon.
Tom. He merely asked whether there
wasn’t something fe-gcr to be had’

  " That rather staggered me for a little
while, but it set me thinking harder. In
the end I went the limit and told him
that the largest diamond of which I had
any inside knowledge was a certain tre-
mendous chunk of r ck. not as yet wholly
at. and recently mined in South Africa,
known as the Great Gordon.

  “ What it could be bought for, if at
all, I couldn't say. Certainly, it was one
of the biggest stones in the world, an !
the only really abnormally big one any -
where near being on the market.

  " Gardner simply nodded, inquired if
I would leave at once, personally under-
take the buying and cutting of the Great
Gordon, and bring it bark here in time
to be set for the anniversary. I con-
sidered it for just five minutes, atid
agreed. There was something about that
deal too fascinating, too infernally profit-
able, too altogether absurd, to resist!

  “ He invited me to meet him at his
bankers' on the following morning, to
arrange letters of credit and an unlimited
cash-supply. Thereafter. I was to leave
as soon as possible, accomplish the mis-
sion, and get back. I did it. There i-
the whole story.”
THE GOING OF THE GORDON.

  “ With the exception of about nine-
tenths of it,” Sheldon commented, while
his face betrayed his lively interest.
“ You must have had worries and respon-
sibilities and adventures by the ton.”

  " Dozens of them.” Randall smiled
easily. “ There were several rows before
I acquired the stone at all; there was a
secret night-departure from the mine that
would put a dime novel in the shade ;
there was an isolated brigand on the
coast who forced me to demonstrate how
fast an automatic pistol can work when
it gets wanned through; all that sort of
thing.

  “ Well, I'm off. I'll raise your hair
with stories of the trip when we've both
more time. Just now I’m slightly anx-
ious to get the Great Gordon into the big
vault and put a guard outside.”

  “You have it with you?" escaped ex-
citedly from the doctor.

  “ I-Iush! ” Randall said sharply. “ Of
course I have! You don’t suppose I ship
the thing around in a trunk, do you?
Except for the time when it was in the
hands of the diamond-cutters, it hasn’t
left me once. Well-”

  He held out his hand in farewell.
Sheldon ignored it. He rose and stood
beside the jeweler, and there was rather
a remarkable quality in his gaze.

  “ Henry! ” he almost whispered. “ Let
me see that stone! ”

  “What?”

  “Do it!” the doctor urged. “I’ve
never seen a diamond of that kind, and
you have increased any previous curiosity
about a thousandfold. Let me have just
one glimpse of it! ”

  “ But my dear fellow-” Randall

broke off.

  If his smile was not annoyed, it was
at least somewhat puzzled.

  “ You know, this whole affair is a
regular dyed-in-the-wool secret, even
from Mrs. Gardner. Only Gardner him-
self, Pelton, his brother-in-law, and I
are aware that the stone is on my
person.”

  “ Well, I’m not going to publish the
fact. Just let me have one look at a
stone that’s worth—how much is it
worth ? ”

  “ Away up in six figures.” said Ran-
dall absently. “ I don't know. I sup-
pose it wouldn’t do any particular harm,

597

but I've gua./led the thing so carefully
all along the line.”

  Sheldon walked across the room and
locked the door. He returned, and stood
expectantly before the jeweler, hands in
pockets. Randall, contemplating the
eager expression, finally sighed resign-
edly.

  “ Well, it’s a fool thing to do, I sup-
pose, and it’s rather a silly thing to re-
fuse, but- Say, pull down those

shades, Tom! ”

  “ No one can see in here.”

  “ Look here, we’re on the street-level,
and I'm not taking any risks!"

  The doctor obeyed briskly. The shades
came down, and Randall's coat came off,
and his vest as well. Somewhat to Shel-
don’s bewilderment, the jeweler began a
rather lengthy expedition into the inner
recesses of his apparel. His right hand
groped and groped in the region of his
left armpit.

  He grunted a little and twisted at
something. He groped farther, and still
farther.

  In the end he grunted again, with ap-
parent satisfaction this time, and re-
gained his coat and vest. In his hand
he held up a rather unique contrivance;
and Sheldon, after a moment's study, be-
came enlightened.

  It was an odd affair in its way, the
product of Randall’s ingenuity and a
Cape Town harness-maker’s craft. There
was a short, stout strap, ta buckle
over the shoulder; there was another,
crossing it and sewed hard to it, which
was obviously meant to encircle the upper
arm. Between the two a pouch was fas-
tened, so placed as to hang under the
arm. All in all, it was a jewel-pouch
with a degree of secure anchorage.

  “ My own invention,” said Randall
softly. “ When this affair’s over I’m
going to patent it and make a million
or two on my own account. Well—sure
that door’s locked?”

  “ Yes,” said Sheldon rather breath-
lessly.

  In the darkened room he watched
tensely as the jeweler opened the mouth
of the pouch. He hardly breathed as a
velvet bag came forth. But he gasped
aloud when there rolled to his desk a
gleaming, glittering diamond of size
hardly conceivable!
going to own—to wear that? ” lie cried.
“ Such seems to be the plan.”

  Randall lingered nervously over the
thing. His fingers fairly twitched as the
doctor raised the stone and looked at it,
wide-eyed and startled beyond words at
the immensity and brilliancy of the gem.
He let a sharp breath of relief escape as
Sheldon’s fingers, positively cold now, re-
turned the crystal fortune.

  In a matter of possibly two seconds
the Great Gordon was returned to its
bag, and the bag to the pouch, and Shel-
don shook his head dazedly.

  “ It's the—the most tremendous thing
of the kind I ever dreamed of! ” he said.
“ I—why, it's worth half a dozen for-
tunes, Henry! ”

  “ Well, what I handed the customs
people alone yesterday afternoon would
keep one or two families in comfort for
a while," Randall muttered thoughtfully.

  “ I declared it for even every cent it’s
worth, for the sake of getting her through
in a hurry and with as little excitement
as possible. Well, now I'm off in earnest,
Tom.”

  “ Going to put it back? ”

  “ Um—no ! ” Randall considered for
a moment. “ I’ll strap it around my
wrist and—eh ? ”

  There was a sharp knock at the door.
Randall, clutching his treasure, turned
swiftly. The doctor hurriedly threw up
the shades, and in a twinkling his bewil-
derment vanished and his professional
calm returned.

  He opened the door to confront the
maid and hear:

  “ The gentlemen, sir. that are waiting.
They sent in their cards, and said they’d
drop in another time if you were still
busy.”

  “Well—hello!'' Sheldon turned to
his visitor with a smile. “ One of the
waiting ones is Mr. Fenway Pelton,
Henry! ”

  “Mrs. Gardner’s brother?”

  “ The same person. He's one of my
patients.”

  “ And he’s growing impatient! ” a
hearty voice in the corridor announced,
“ Alone yet? "

  “ Going to be now," laughed the doc-
tor. “ There's a—an acquaintance of
yours in here, Mr. Pelton.”

For a second Randall scowled his
frank annoyance. Down the corridor
steps were coming; in another moment
Gardner's own brother-in-law would be
in the room, and there he was, standing
with the Great Gordon in his hand. At
the very least, the fact that Sheldon had
had the first view of it would be obvious!

  Rapidly he thrust it into the side
pocket of his coat, just as the tall, broad,
and immaculately fashionable figure of
Mr. Fenway Pelton came through the
door.

  “ Doctor, 1 want to introduce Mr.
David Lane,” he said. “ He’s troubled
with a few of the things you specialize,

I believe, and- Hello, Randall! ”

  He crossed to the jeweler as the slen-
der, rather pale man behind him shook
hands with the physician.

  “By George! You’re looking well,
Randall! ” he cried. “ Diamond-chasing
seems to agree with you! ”

  He drew off his gloves and said more
softly:

  “ So you did get her here safely! I
imagine Philip was a little relieved when
you ’phoned him last night that you were
actually ashore with the thing.”

“ I wasn't particularly sorry myself.”
“ No, I fancy not.” Pelton dropped
into a chair and stretched his long legs.
“Where is she now? Locked up down-
town, I suppose?”

  “ Just at the moment, the Great Gor-
don diamond is in my hand, in this
pocket.”

  “ Phew! ” Pelton opened his eyes
somewhat. “ You don’t mind lugging
fortunes around, do you? Still, I sup'-
pose jewels don’t impress you much more
than greenbacks do the bank-teller.”

  “ Perhaps not.” Randall smiled,
rather thankful for the suggestion. “ I
try to take pretty good care of them,
though.”

  Pelton nodded, and stretched the fin-
gers of his gloves thoughtfully. The
doctor and Lane crossed to them, and
Randall prepared for the third time to
make for the comforting depths of his
own big vault, farther down-town.

  Again he was to be halted, however,
for Pelton looked up suddenly.

  “ I say, doctor—and you, too. Lane—
you’re not addicted to talking about
things that are not to be mentioned? No,

popped from his head. One violently
shaking hand pointed to the blotting-pad
on Sheldon's desk.

  The space was wholly blank!

   I‘he Great Gordon, pouch, straps, and
all, had disappeared!

CHAPTER II.

AN APPARENT EVANESCENCE.

  If old Mr. Frothingham had actually
opened operations bv tearing down the
ceiling the shock would have been rather
gentler.

  The four men stared at one another in
thunderstruck silence for a matter of
minutes: a remarkable sound, half groan,
half wail, escaped Randall.

   It was Sheldon who first regained his
wits, however. He shook himself to-
gether and laughed—and the spell broke.

  “ The thing hasn't walked out of the
room, you know,” he said. “ It may be
a remarkable sort of stone, but it hasn't
legs."

  “ But it was—jvas there! It was lying
right there, Tom. and—and-" Ran-
dall mouthed, incoherently.

  “ Yes. and now it is lying somewhere
within three feet of there! ” said Shel-
don. with a good deal *of briskness, as
he crossed the office and threw up the
shades once more.

  With the coming of more light four
highly interested pairs of eyes centered
on the desk. They as well might have
centered on the chandelier or the mantel
or the door-knob.

   Typically neat as all his other posses-
sions, the flat expanse of Sheldon’s desk-
top held nothing unnecessary: it revealed
a small ink-well, a prescription-pad. a
book or two—and nothing more!

   “ Well, it slid off the desk, then ! " said
the doctor, with a note of impatience in
his voice. “ In the excitement over
Frothingham one of you must have jarred
the desk, or the pad. or something of the
sort.”

  “ I don’t think any of us were near
enough to touch the desk, doctor." said
I.ane.

   “ And if that were the case why isn’t
the pad crooked now?" asked the jew-
eler excitedly.

  “ Eh ? Why—T.ord! I don’t know.

Maybe .me of you brushed it off with his
coat whe> turning. Some of you look on
that side.’

  The iloeutr“dropped to his knees and
searched the rug. It was rather an un-
necessary proceeding, for the leather con-
trivance could have been seen plainly the
length of the room, but in the excitement
the physician’s nose went almost to the
carpet.

  ill ere and there he moved, searching
energetically; he moved chairs; he
peered under the table; he looked even
into the entirely empty fireplace.

  In the end he rose with a puzzled
grunt.

   “ It's over that side! ” he observed.

  Pelton also stood erect, and Randall
with him.

   “ There isn't a sign of it here, Shel-
don ! ” said the former.

  "No! Not a sign! Not the first
sign! ” the jeweler cried wildly.

  " Do you mean to say that that dia-
mond isn't on the floor within two feet
of you?" the doctor exclaimed, in some
bewilderment. “ Why. bosh! It must
be! Let me look."

  He came quickly around the desk, and
his sharp eyes ran across the floor. It
was a search of painful simplicity, and
quite as fruitless as the one he had just
completed.

  From side to side, from corner to
corner, of the office, practically every
inch of floor was visible. An object the
size of a thimble would have been in-
stantly perceptible. There was no indi
cation of the Great Gordon.

  Sheldon scratched his head and
frowned for an instant.

  “Well, here, then!" he said. “It’s
gone under the desk—that’s all. One of
you take hold there, please. Yes. that’s
right. We’ll move it away from the wall
altogether and carry it into the center
of the room. That's it."

  Randall was on his knees again as the
desk rose and was moved away; breath-
ing hard, he craned forward eagerly.
And some two or three seconds later he
sank back somewhat limply.

   “ It isn’t there!” he announced.

  " What! ”

   “ Not a trace of it! ”

  “ Can—can we have dragged it along
under the desk?" Sheldon suggested.
THE GOING OK THE GORDON.

Perhaps the confounded thing’s caught
in the bottom part.”

  His hands closed on the desk and
tilted it upward bodily; the three
crouched together for a view; three
heads shook together.

  “ Nothing doing, Sheldon.” Felton re-
marked.

  The doctor stared blankly at him.

  He rolled the desk back to its old
place and perched on top : and for a little
he looked at the trio in silence. Ex-
treme bewilderment was written upon
two of those faces; bewilderment and
horror on the third. Sheldon began to
feel peculiarly as he faced the problem.

  “ Gentlemen.” he said. “ I'm not ad-
dicted to profanity, but I’d unhesitating-
ly pronounce this about the damnedest
happening on record."

  Randall was gathering his courage, it
seemed. He looked from one to the
other, and suddenly his uppermost
thought crystallized into words:

  “ I—I,” he said, uncertainly—“ I
don't like to say it, but this—this matter

seems to lie between the three-”

  He stopped and reddened a little.

  “ Eh?” Sheldon's eyes opened and a
faint smile appeared on his lips. “ Don’t
be absurd, Henry. You’re excited, and
all that sort of thing, but don’t begin by
accusing us.”

  *’ But that stone never-”

  “ Henry! ” said the doctor, with a
sharp snap of his fingers, “do you be-
lieve me capable of stealing that or any
other diamond?”

  The men faced each other, and Ran-
dall surrendered suddenly.

  “ Frankly. Tom. I know you didn’t! ”
he muttered.

  “ All right. Pass on to Mr. Pelton.
then. He’s Mrs. Gardner’s brother, for
one thing. For another, he hardly needs

the stone. As for Mr. Lane-"

  “ I’ll vouch for Dave Lane," said
Pelton, with a grave smile. " I’ve
known him Ar fifteen years, Randall."
The doctor nodded.

  “ Therefore. Henry, gather your wits
together. If there was a stranger heri-.
or if any one else had even been in the
room, theft might have been a possibility.
As it is, we've got to face the situation
and sit down and reason out just where
that infernal stone is."

  He set the example and found a cigar.

  Let’s see. What do we know about
it?” he went on thoughtfully. “ It was
on the desk, for one thing.’ Who laid
it there? ”

  “ I did,” said Pelton.

  “ And you had not touched it,
Henry? ”

  " I was just going to pick it up when
that old man arrived, Tom.”

  “ But vou hadn't laid hands on it ? ”

  “ No.”

  “ And when Frothingham came to the
door you all turned toward it, if I re-
member right?”

  “ Yes.”

  “ And when you turned back, a sec-
ond or so later, the thing was gone.
Humph! ”

  Sheldon stared at the wall behind the
desk and whistled a bar or two.

  “ Well, bv George! It passes me! If
there was a trap-door in that wall, or an
open chimney within reaching distance.
I'd almost say that some insanely intel-
ligent person had gathered it in."

  He ended with another shake of the
head.

  “ As it is,” groaned Randall. “ the
Great Gordon is simply gone!”

  “ Well, it hasn’t gone into thin air.”
Sheldon pursued dryly. “ We know
that much, anyway. Sole-leather doesn’t
vaporize, at any rate. Um! Henry, is
it possible that you may have picked it
up and thrust it into one of your pockets
when the door opened? Subconscious
cerebration, you know?"

  Do you suppose I shouldn't have
found it out by this time?" Randall
cried, running hopelessly through his
pockets. “ No."

  “One of you gentlemen, then?"

  “ Not I, certainly,” said Lane, with
an uneasy laugh, as he rummaged
through the various receptacles of his
person. “ No. doctor, there's nothing
of the sort here; and furthermore. I mav
say that, on account of its huge value. I
hesitated at even touching the gem when
Mr. Pelton offered it to me for inspec-
tion.”

  “ And you. Mr. Pelton?”

  Pelton had removed his gloves again
and was running through his pockets.

  “ I’m afraid that I shall have to spoil
your theory, Sheldon," he said. " I cer-

tainly did not touch the Great Gordon
after piadng it on the desk.”

  The doctor, frowning again, investi-
gated his own person. lie ended by
throwing up his hands with a helpless
gesture.

  " Not here, either! ” He looked from
one to the other of them, and exclaimed:
“Good Lord! I'm nut a detective or
an analyst of this sort of freak happen-
ing. Hasn’t one of you a suggestion to
offer ? "

  Blank, staring silence was his only
answer. The doctor chewed his cigar
meditatively and looked around the floor
again. It was as empty of diamond as
his own brain of a solution of the mys-
tery.

  “ Young woman! " came from the ad-
joining room, in a thin, cracked voice.

  “ Frothingham! ” muttered the doctor.

  “ Young woman! Come here. I say!
Positively. I must insist that you inform
the doctor at once that I am waiting
here and suffering.”

  Sheldon rose slowly.

  “ Gentlemen. I'm afraid that I shall
have to ask you to step into the waiting-
room for half an hour or so. Mr.
Frothingham has evidently gone his
limit. He’ll he in here in a moment.”

  “ Well. I think I won’t wait, Shel-
don,” said Pelton. “ I have a number
of things to attend to this morning with
Mr. Lane." f

  He, too, arose, and Lane with him,
and upon the latter’s face was a degree
of perplexity.

   Mr. Randall,” he said slowly,
“ this—this has been a most remarkable,
a most unfortunate, occurrence. I—
well, I quite understand that in your
mind, at least, a certain degree of sus-
picion must rest upon all three of us.
Before leaving the room I wish very
much indeed that you, personally, would
make a thorough search of me."

  Pelton nodded approval.

  “ Good scheme. Dave. Go ahead
with it, Randall. It is the best plan all
around.” _

  “ And count me in on it,” added the
doctor, as he removed his coat and held
it forth for a beginning.

  Randall faced them with a weak smile.

  “ Do you suppose for a moment that
I’m going to do anything so absurd un-

der the circumstances, and particularly
in the face o,: a plain invitation? I
am bound to confess, gentlemen, that I
can’t conceive any of you taking the
Great (Jordon, if for no other reason
than that none of you had the oppor-
tunity to do it.”

  “ But nevertheless, Mr. Randall,”.
Lane insisted, “ it is due to us as much
as to yourself. If you will be kind
enough to begin with me. Our time's
a little limited, and the old gentleman
seems to be uneasy.”

  “ I'm not going to search you! ” the
jeweler cried, almost impatiently. “ It
is fair and square of you to suggest it,
but—I’m not going to do it."

  He turned to Sheldon. “ Good-by.
Tom."

  “ Good-by, old man. I'm infernally
sorry."

  “ Thank you. And you will keep it
quiet, for a little while, at least?”

  “ Of course, but-■”

  “ And promise me another thing,”
Randall said miserably. “ When you
get rid of the old chap, in there, make
another search of this room, and as
thorough a one as you know how.”

  “ I certainly will. I’ll tear the whole
place to pieces, Henry, if I have to de-
vote the day to it. If she’s here. I'll
have her before noon, and I’ll telephone
you.”

  “ Thank you. Tom.”

  Randall’s voice was almost quivering.
His head seemed to jump with every
pulse; his feet scuffed weakly along the
hall behind the other two men.

  It was only on the steps once more and
in the outer air that the full meaning of
his loss swept over him.

  Not half an hour ago he had walked
up those steps secure in the possession of
one of the world’s largest diamonds,
cheerfully satisfied in the execution of a
commission that had netted him thou-
sands of dollars and considerable pres-
tige.

  Now he was walking out, and—Pel-
ton was speaking:

  “ I didn't like to say it in there, and
perhaps I shouldn’t say it in Lane's pres-
ence, Randall, but I suppose you realize
that a pretty serious thing has occurred
this morning?”

  “ Serious! ” burst from the jeweler.
THE GOING OF THE GORDON.

603

“ Do you suppose that it is possible for
any one to realize it more sironglv than
1 do?”

  “ Yes! " Pelton's voice was decidedly
sharp. “ Mr. Gardner, for example, is
likely to feel the loss quite as keenly.
He has spent a fortune—and not a
small one—to secure the Great Gordon.
Fortunately, having seen it myself, I can
testify that you at least brought it into
the country, but when he learns that the
stone has vanished ? ”

  Pelton’s aristocratic eyebrows went up
a trifle.

  Randall moistened his lips. He too
had been considering that phase, and in
a measure he was prepared. His eyes,
turned upon the other, were fairly im-
ploring.

   “ Mr. Pelton," he said huskily. “ if it
turns out—I can't believe it. but if it
does turn out—that the stone has really
vanished for good all the reparation that
1 can make will be made, whether it
takes every dollar I have in the world
or not. But until I can feel more cer-
tain that the Great Gordon is not going
to reappear, may I ask that you keep the
affair a secret?”

  Pelton’s eyebrows went higher.

  “ My dear sir! ” he protested, “ Gard-
ner is my brother-in-law, you know.
I'll hardly be justified, knowing what I
do. in keeping quiet.”
t “ I understand that, but—but just for
a little time, Pelton; just until I get
back my breath and—and am able to
take steps toward recovering the stone.”

  Randall waited.

  Pelton tapped the pavement annoyedly
with his cane as they sauntered along,
and his expression did not look alto-
gether hopeful for the jeweler.

-	“ That’s—pshaw! That's rather a
remarkable proposition, you know, Ran-
dall. I don't half like it. Gardner, nat-
urally. should know at once. It's a sort
of family treason for me even to contem-
plate keeping quiet, too.”

   “ Just for a little while! ”

  “Well, for how long a period?"

  “ One week ! ” hazarded Randall.

   “ Urn! ”

  Pelton stopped at the corner and
studied the curb in silence. When he
faced Randall it was with a doubtful
smile.

  “ V\ ell—I 11 do that,” he said.
“ Whatever sort of position it may put
me in, I will say nothing for one week.
But, Randall," and his finger shook
menacingly, “at the very latest, if you
should not get track of the diamond,
you will make the disclosure yourself,
one week from to-day.”

   “ Yes.”

  A word from Lane, and they sepa-
rated. Randall watched them walk
away, in something of a haze. Finally
he turned-half blindly to the car line
which would land him at the store.

   Gould it actually be possible that the
diamond was gone?

  Was he dreaming, or was the Great
Gordon actually gone?

   Wasn’t it some beastly, hideous night-
mare, from which he would awaken to
find the gem under his arm and the pis-
tol under his pillow, as they had been
for so long?

  His hand went up with the familiar
furtive motion. No, that sensation of
emptiness in his armpit had but too solid
foundation. No thick little case was
there now. It was all plain, hard fact.
He and the Great Gordon had parted
company. Randall turned from the
thought with a shudder. He would have
to calm down first and try to analyze the
situation afterward.

  Like a gloomy ghost, he entered his
own store for the first time in months.

  The dozen or so clerks were amazed.
Once the genial employer, with a nod
and a smile for every one. Randall
seemed to have returned from his pleas-
ure-trip a changed mortal. His step was
leaden; he saw no one; even when
Thorne, his manager, hurried forward
with outstretched hand he was hardly
aware of the presence.

   Into his private office at the rear he
went, with a dull steadiness. The desk
was just as he had left it, the chairs in
the same position: the books and the
catalogues on the shelves might never
have been out of his sight, so familiar
were they. The dream-aspect of the
affair returned with fresh strength as
he sank into his chair and threw up the
desk-top.

  Now he must settle down to business,
must collect himself and brace himself.

  “ There’s a gentleman been waiting
604

for ymi some minutes, sir!” said Thorne
from the doorway.

  “ Eh?" Randall's head came up with
n jerk “ Who is it? "

  "It’s Mr. Philip Gardner, sir!"

CHAPTER III.

INTERVIEWS AMI DWUCTtONS.

  Gardner!

  Of all people on the fare of the globe
whom Randall did not wish to interview-
just then, Gardner was certainly the most
unwelcome.

  For an instant the jeweler almost con-
templated precipitate flight by way of
the window. Then, in the dire emer-
gency. calm came over him rapidly.
There was no earthly way of dodging
it: Gardner knew that he was there;
Gardner himself had appointed the inter-
view the uight before over the telephone.
Now he would haw to be faced.

  Plainly, the truth would be out of the
question just then. Plainly, also, he
would have a somewhat difficult job in
concocting a suitable falxhood. Mean
while. Thorne was waiting and studying
his employer with frank curiosity; and
Randall said shortly:

  " Show him in here. Thorne.”

  And now for it!

  The jeweler sat rigid and listened,
lie heard Gardner's big voice; he
heard the heavy steps approaching along
the aisle, like so many strokes of his
own business death-knell; he heard the
millionaire's hearty chuckle at something
and shuddered, If he were not able to
brazen it out, about how many minutes
more would Gardner be chuckling?

  But as the door opened again and
Randall arose he felt, with vast relief
and much surprise, that his smile was
all it should have been; he was aware,
joyfully, that the hand which shook the
millionaire’s no longer trembled; and he
returned to his chair with a stilled sigh
of faint satisfaction,

  Gardner smiled approvingly at him,
and with delicious irony summed up the
situation in:

   “ So it's itU right! "

  Randall almost caught his breath;
and in spite of all the grim humor of the
remark, brought a smile to his lips.

   "Yes, it’s <»//. right! " he assented.

  “Have intich trouble buying it?"

  " No more than I told you. After I
secured it, everything went smoothly."

  "Have any bother with the customs
people ? "

  '■ Not a bit. I put it through there
like a streak oj lightning. Hy the way,
1 have a balance of three or four thou-
sand dollars Ahat >till belong* to you."

  "Ah? All right. The fact of your
bringing in such a stone didn't leak out
anywhere, did it?"

  “ No, I'm sure it didn't."

  Randall was talking quickly, and
thinking even more rapidly. Now, lo-
calise of the latter condition, silence
fell. A hall-minute, and it lmd become
uncomfortable silence. Gardner, with a
little justice, was waiting for something;
and presently he announced the fact.

  “ Well, let's have the first glimpse of
the wonder, Mr. Randall."

  "Eh?" The jeweler's eyes opened
in apparent astonishment. " Did you
want to see the Great Gordon this morn-
ing, Mr. Gardner?"

  " Whv, of course! "

 ‘■DU you? Pshaw! 1-”

  “ What? What's the matter?" Gard-
ner asked quickly, “ Isn't it all right.
Randall?"

  " Why, the stone is perfectly safe, of
course," said the jeweler, with the
sunvest of smiles. " There were one or
two of the facets that needed just the
least trifle more polishing, that is all. 1
took it down-town early this morning
and left it with the diumond-cutters."

   Per j telly safe there, is it. Randall?"

   “ As safe as if it was locked in a treas-
ury-vault, sir!"

  If a case must be made out of thin
air. Randall was impressed with the fact
that it had better lie made as strongly
as possible.

  “ Well, will you take a run down with
me now for a look at the stone?" the
millionaire inquired suddenly.

  " Eh ?" The jeweler wondered
whether insane horror were gleaming
from his eyes.

  “ There's nothing to prevent, is
there ? "

  " Certainly not. I will go, if you’re
very anxious." Randall said siowlv.
'* But would yon not do better to wait

ancl see the stone in absolute perfection.
Mr. Gardner? The Great Gordon is a
magnificently beautiful gem: I should
very much advise waiting until it is in
the finest possible shape."

  “ And how long will the cutting
take? ”

  “ It will be returned one week from
this morning. It is a rather more care-
ful job than the diamond-cutter en-
counters ordinarily, you know.”

  Gardner pursed his lips thoughtfully.
Randall's left hand, out of sight, was
silently snapping its fingers at the rate
of two snaps to the second as he watched
the millionaire.

  In his comparative ignorance of dia-
monds and their handling, in his confi-
dence in Randall, would he accept the
excuse, w6uld be consent to wait? Or
would be insist on going down to the
mythical cutter and viewing the Great
Gordon? Was disaster, after all, to
come at once, and-

  Gardner was nodding reluctant acqui-
escence.

  “ Well, you probably know best, Mr.
Randall,” he said rather grudgingly.
“ I should have liked to see the thing,
considering its purpose and all the time
and money that has been spent on' it.
Still, you’re probably right. The first
impression had better be the most per-
fect possible one. You can’t hurry the
work any? ”

  “ It would be the last thing advisable,
Mr. Gardner,” said Randall, earnesth’.

  And then, after a few minutes of
chatting and the recital of several ad-
ventures of the trip, the jeweler was
alone once more.

  He called for Thorne and further
astonished that individual by ordering
that all details requiring his attention
should wait, that he was not to be dis-
turbed. He locked the door and lighted
a cigar; and head in hands he undertook
to wrestle with the problem.

  At first, the gloomy side of the affair
overwhelmed him. Up to leaving home
that morning, the bringing of the Great
Gordon had been nothing more than a
combination of decided enjoyment and
good business. He had seen the world,
he had a good- profit in view, and all
things were satisfactory.

  And now?

  Well, now it appeared that the Great
Gordon had turned 011 him with all the
force of which its immense value was
capable. From the probable termination
Randall turned shakily. He would have
to make good; that went without saying,
both by reason of Gardner’s power to
compel him and by reason of his own
conscience.

  It was going to be a somewhat cheer-
less process; it would involve the sign-
ing over or the selling out of his splen-
did inherited business; it would mean
that his almost lifelong home would
have to go as well. And even that would
not square the debt, for when he had
rendered himself penniless and without
income other than what he might make
on salary somewhere, there would be a
balance due to Gardner!

  All in all, the Great Gordon seemed
to have changed to the veriest hoodoo
the mind could conjure.

  However, there was another side.
Thanks to Pelton’s goodness and Gard-
ner’s acceptance of the lie he had of-
fered, he had still one week in which
to act.

  Stones do not go into smoke without
reason; a mass of sole leather does not
pass out of existence in a twinkling;
somewhere or other, diamond, pouch, and
all must still exist. His part was to find
them, but—how?

  First and most natural inspiration
included the police. Randall brightened
momentarily, but only momentarily.

  The realization swept over him that
the very last people who must know of
the disappearance were the police. To
communicate with them meant, in all
probability, publicity; publicity signi-
fied instant ruin ! Not only present ruin,
either. It would be bad enough in all
conscience to have Gardner upon him for
an accounting, but his prestige in the
trade would suffer tremendously as well!

  A man who can take a diamond of
immense value and lose it in such a
manner that there is absolutely no trace,
is unlikely to be trusted with other dia-
monds, great or small.

  Moreover, what could the police do?
The idea of using them carried with
it the accepted idea of theft; and this
Randall was not ready to assume.

  Sheldon he simply could not suspect;
7

THE ALL-STORY MAGAZINE.

606

Pelton he certainly could not suspect;
l.ane, too, seemed vouched for and, even
more, as nearly as Randall recalled he
had been farthest from the desk in that
fatal second or two that witnessed the
mysterious passing of the gem.

  But if theft did not enter into the
proposition, what then?

  The stone had emphatically neither
blown nor slid from the desk; there had
been not the slightest indication of it or
the pouch on the floor or elsewhere.
And had it dropped, there shoujd have
been some noise to the process; case and
all, the Great Gordon was not a feather-
weight outfit.

  Bah!

  Why hadn't he taken the three men
at their word and searched them on the
spot? Beyond doubt, it would have been
an embarrassing, a most uncomfortable
proceeding to go systematically through
their pockets, but it would have estab-
lished at least that neither of them was
carrying the diamond.

  Or did that need to be established?
Was it exactly likely that any man, rich
or poor, good, bad, or indifferent, with
a stolen fortune on his person in per-
fectly detectable shape would offer him-
self to be—nay, would insist upon be-
ing—searched ?

  Randall’s head began to swim. Out
in the store, several of his beautiful
clocks began to strike off the hour of
twelve, and he started up. He must
have pondered the problem for a consid-
erable time, and without any result.
Since he had but seven days, the half of
one of them was far too precious to
spend in fruitless mooning.

  He must have help, some sort of
skilled help, and at once. From what
quarter? Obviously, the private detec-
tive field.

  There was Bell, who kept the very
quiet and unadvertised agency on the
other side of the city. Bell had done
well enough last spring, in that little
matter of the stolen rubies; indeed, now
that Randall came to consider it, he had
done everything possible each time he
had been employed by the house, for his
labors inevitably ended only when the
criminal had been detected and jailed.

  Randall gave a decided nod and
reached for the telephone director}-; and

five minutes later he had Bell's assur-
ance of a visit at one o'clock.

  The hollow farce of lunch over, Ran-
dall returned to find the detective wait-
ing.

  He was a most ordinary appearing
man, this same John Bell. His features,
his clothes, his ready-made necktie were
ordinary to a degree. He might have
passed for a bookkeeper or a clerk or
a man waiting hungrily to insure your
life.

  You might have gone by him ten times
in a crowd, and on the eleventh failed
to realize that you had ever seen him
before; and it was this same quality of
utter conventionality of appearance that
formed no small part of his stock in
trade.

  ‘‘Another job for me, Mr. Randall?”

  The jeweler dropped into his chair.

  “If you can find the biggest diamond
that has been sold in the world during
the past ten years—yes! ”

  “Stolen?” Bell's expressionless fea-
tures betrayed only the slightest inter-
est.

  Randall locked his door and plunged
into the story in a low voice. Bell lis-
tened without comment; his face grew
a trifle more animated as the jeweler
described the mysterious taking off of the
Great Gordon, and when the recital
came to its miserable close he crossed
his legs and smiled a little.

  “ Mr. Randall, you are quite positive
that some outside party didn’t walk in,
tie a string to your case and suddenly
jerk it through shade and window—or
up the chimnev—or through the key-
hole?”

  Randall frowned at the levity; Bell
smiled a little more.

  “ And as a diamond expert, you would
go to court and swear that it is impos-
sible for a diamond to go into a vapor-
ous state at ordinary room tempera-
ture?”

  “ Certainly, but-”

  “ Then, my dear sir, how can you see
anything but the simple fact tlm'one of
those three men stole it ? ”

  " But it's impossible, I tell you!
They-”

  “ Nothing’s impossible, unless it be an
impenetrable mystery, Mr. Randall. If
you can show me that that diamond
THE GOING OF THE GORDON.

607

wasn't stolen, I’ll chip in all my worldly
goods with yours, if bad luck should
make restitution to Gardner necessary.

  “Now who stole it? Let’s see. For
a starter, we're bound to get a motive.
Which one of your three gentlemen
needs money the most?”

  “ None of them do! ”

  “ The doctor is well fixed? "

  “ Very well. More than that I have

known him for-”

  " Well, that doesn’t necessarily alter
matters,” Bell chuckled. “ How about
Lane? ”

  “If he is the David Lane I looked
up this noon, he is a person very com-
fortably supplied with this world’s
goods.”

  “And Pelton?”

  “ Man alive! He's wealthy, and he’s
Mrs. Gardner’s brother in addition!”
“Ah?” Bell studied the ceiling. “I
wonder if there’s any little family row-
lurking around this thing. I'll have to
look that up. too.

  “ Still,” he rubbed his chin. “ Un-
likely. I suppose. Well, we’ve estab-
lished that none of them has any
particular reason for wanting to steal
diamonds. Next item: why did one of
them steal it? ”

  “ Bell, it may sound absurd, but I
can’t believe that they did! "

  “ It does sound absurd, decidedly so.
You are positive that the maid or the
old man you mentioned did not enter the
room ? ”

  “ Absolutely."

  “ And that windows and doors were
closed and that the diamond was only
in the hands of those three men. Con-
found it! That certainly settles it!
Why did he do it? Was it the overpow-
ering fascination of a jewel of such
size ?

  “ It might have been that, Mr. Ran-
dall. So far as you know, are any of
the three temperamentally nervous—
high-strung, imaginative—anything of
that sort ? ”

  “ Sheldon certainly isn't. Pelton
doesn't look or act it. if he is.”

  “And this Mr. Lane?”

  “Well, he's rather a nervous, frail-
appearing person, Bell,” Randall said
thoughtfully. “ He’s a fidgety sort of
mortal, I think.”

  “Ah!" Bell's face brightened a lit-
tle. “ Now, isn't it supposable that he
may have been overtaken by an insane
desire to acquire the thing?”

  “ Well, if that were the case, why
should he insist on being searched?"
Bell laughed shortly.

  “It is a sort of sticking-point, that
searching business, isn’t it? I suppose
we might consider a theory on psycho-
logical grounds that he was simply in-
capable of returning it of his own will,
that he wanted to have it discovered on
him and taken away, but—oh, it's prettv
thin."

  “ And if such a thing had occurred,
they're all men of education and sense.
If one of them had yielded to such an
impulse, aren’t the chances ten to one
that he would have regained his senses
in a minute or two and handed it back? ”
“ Perhaps he would—perhaps he
would! ”

  Bell considered his cigar for a time.
When he looked up it was with a new
idea:

  “ Mr. Randall, as you tell the story,
the taking of that gem must have been
a lightning piece of work. Are any of
the three particularly quick of motion—
in a general way, I mean? ”

  “ Only Lane—he seems to move in lit-
tle jerks, Bell. Pelton’s big and pon-
derous and pretty slow. And for the
matter of Sheldon, he was across the
room when I discovered the loss.”

  “Lane again, eh? Lane!”

  Bell’s hands went into his pockets.
He rose and walked' slowly back and
forth for a time.

  “ Any objection to my calling up your
friend Sheldon. Mr. Randall?"

 “Not the slightest. Why? Had
anything turned up, he would have sent
a message before this.”

  “ Doubtless, but I’d like to have a
chat with him.”

  Sheldon answered the wire in person,
and the jeweler’s nerves tingled as he
watched Bell's face. Hope against hope
though it might lie, he waited for the
suddenly animated expression which
would mean good news.

  It failed to come. Bell announced
his identity and, speaking sharply and
with more authority than Randall would
have supposed possible, put a line of
•JO- V

608 m

more or less painted questions. He
seemed to receive answers in no sense
startling.

  In the end he rang .off and shrugged
his shoulders.

  “ He has nothing to tell, it seems. He
says that he lias been over every inch of
the floor, has taken the drawers out of
the desk and even gone into the chim-
ney with a light, and that there is abso-
lutely nothing to be found.

  “ He says that he locks the office be-
hind him when it becomes necessary to
leave and asked me if there was any-
thing more I could advise him to do.
There wasn’t.”

  The detective smiled, somewhat rue-
fully.

  “ Do you know. I had a notion that
if I went at him hard and fast, as I did,
it might startle him into giving some
sign of knowledge of the affair," he
said.

  “ And while I'm not out as an expert
criminal detector by means of the tele-
phoned voice, I'm bound to say that

there was no sign of agitation and that
more open talk I never heard! ”

  “ And if you knew the man . .
Randall began.

  Hell was not listening. His unattrac-
tive brow was wrinkled in thought as
he stared at the lioor. He whistled an
endless melody of his own composition
and beat time with his foot; until,
facing Randall again, he seemed to
have reached a decision.

  “ Well, sir, we have just one course
to pursue."

  “And that?”

  “ That involves the most careful sort
of watch on all three men up to the very
moment we locate the Great Gordon.
I’ll set men on the job this afternoon.
Oh, don’t start, Mr. Randall. They
won’t know any more than that they’re
shadowing somebody.”

  His eyes narrowed into a squinting
smile.

  “ Meanwhile, if you want my private
opinion, your diamond is in possession of
one Mr. David Lane! ”

HORACE JESSUP shivered a little
as he drew nearer to the roaring
fire upon the wide hearth.

        “ Pete will find it very hard
getting through to-night,” he remarked
impartially. “ The drifts in Gatto's
Canon were almost impassable at day-
break and the Yellowstone was whimper-
ing like a half-starved wolf-cub. It is
going to be a fearful night, Bob—even
for the Bad Lands.”

  The man to whom he had spoken, a
well-knit, young fellow with the face of
a seraph, rose languidly from his seat at
the narrow deal table and crossed the

room to the one window which the shack
afforded.’

  “I thought that it would clear up be-
fore noon,” he remarked non-committal-
ly.' “Damn this climate, anyway. It
is early spring now down in God's coun-
try. Jessup. The yellow jasmine is bud-
ding along the banks of the creeks and
the mocking-birds are singing-”

  He stopped short suddenly.

  “Did you speak to me, Jessup?” he
asked, but Jessup was poking the fire
noisily and did not answer.

  Perhaps he heard above the hissing of
the soft, wet snow upon the panes the
echo of a bird's love-song. Perhaps he
saw in the thousand circling sparks that
melted in the black maw of the wide
chimney the fluttering fireflies that
braided a brooding Southern night with
torches of palest gold.

a raw spot. You’ve been a good friend
to me though, old chap, and if the time
ever comes when I can do you a good
turn-”

  Jessup did not look at him.

  He still stared through the tiny win-
dow at the barren sweep of the dreary
waste of butte and canon, the swollen
current of willow-bordered water creep-
ing along under the sullen sky to join
its alkali-roughened voice to the roar
and clamor of the Yellowstone, so lately
freed from its bonds of ice. Late in the
season as it was the scene was especially
gloomy, with no faintest hint of vegeta-
tion, no vaguest promise of a resurrect-
ing spring.

  Horace Jessup dragged his eyes away
from it to the scanty fringe of conifers
that formed the green border of our
Lady’s mantle, and higher yet to the
pure white, shrouded form, half-veiled in
the drifts of swirling snow.

  “ I think that I hear Pete now,” he
said, still without turning. “ I guess he
is going to make it. after all. And the
storm can’t be so heavy as you fancied,
Porter, or he never would have been
able to get the stage through.”

  Porter had .flung himself on the
lounge and now raised himself on his
elbow.

  “ Good, old boy! ” l»e said approv-
ingly. “ I didn't say that he wouldn’t
get through. I didn't speak so posi-
tively.”

  It was nearing night-fall, and the
stage stopped short at the low fence of
lodge-pole pine that surrounded the
shack. Pete climbed down from his seat
a little stiffly. His weather-beaten face,
bitten, blue by the cruel wind, looked
drawn and puckered, like unripened fruit
that the frost has nipped. His voice,
however, was cheery enough.

  “ I'll have to camp here with you fel-
lows to-night,” he said casually. “ I
wouldn't try to get any farther—not for
any amount of money. I ought to ’a'
got through, too. I’ve got two pas-
sengers in the stage booked for Pike."

  “Two passengers!”

  Something in the bland artlessness of
the stage-driver’s face had made Porter,
who had followed Jessup to the door,
vaguely suspicious.

  Pete nodded.

  “Petticoats!” he said pleasantly in a
stage-whisper. “ A young woman anil
her aunt. And say, Porter, she’s a peach
all right—the young one is. The

other-”

  “ Is this the place where we are to
stop, driver?”

  The clear, metallic, frosty tones had
an immediate effect upon Pete. He
winked at Porter, and turned hurriedly.

  “ This is the place—yes’m,” he said
genially. “ We can’t get any farther
to-night, and that’s the plain truth of
it—and there’s no use trying. The
horses have been floundering belly-deep
in snow for the last four hours, and they
are plumb beat now. And with night
coming on——”

 The woman who had spoken said
something in a lower voice to her com-
panion, who seemed to agree—a little re-
luctantly. ■

  “If you are quite sure that it is for
the best,” she said in a low, sweet voice.

  Porter pushed the grinning stage-
driver aside and assisted the two to alight.

  " You are both very welcome to the
little that we have to offer, I am sure.”
he said hastily. “ We can at least assure
you a roof over your heads and some-
thing fairly decent to eat. Jessup!”

  But Jessup, with unwonted shyness,
had vanished.

  “ Y'ou are very good,” said the elde?«.
woman stiffly. “ I had no idea that'Wie*
roads would be so impassable now that it
is almost the last of April. Bari

home-”

  The young man looked at her whole-
some. middle-aged face, a little wistfully.

  “ Perhaps 1 had better introduce my-
self.” he ventured. “ My name is Robert
Porter, and my partner and I have only
been West -a little over a year. 1 an

from Louisiana. He-”

 “From Louisiana!” The older
woman looked at him a little oddly.

" Do you hear that, Margaret, my dear?
The young man, as we are. is from
Louisiana. The world is a little place,
after all. We are from Shreveport. Mr.
Porter, my niece and I. My husband
was a Norris, you know. We are go-
ing-”

  The girl, a slender, blue-eyed thing,
created a momentary diversion, much to
Porter’s relief.
  “I am almost frozen, Aunt Martha,"
she complained, “ and you are keeping.
Mr.—Porter—bare-headed in the snow.
We had better go in the house, dear,
since he has been so good as to say that
we might. The explanation, you know,
can come later.”

   Porter, still more than a little puzzled
by something peculiar in the situation,
went before them a little slowly up the
path. The older woman peered beyond
him "through the swirling drifts at the
cabin and caught above it for a fleeting
instant the vague outlines of the rock-
formation called by the natives “ Our
Lady of the Snows ” that towered above
them. Then the black, bitter gloom of
a night in late spring in the edge of the
Bad Lands closed down and shut the
vision out.

  “ How spiritually inspiring your sur-
roundings are.” she said, still a little
stiffly. “ What an uplift such soul-com-
munings with nature must bring about.”
“ Yes, no doubt,” agreed Porter pleas-
antly, if a little absently. He was won-
dering nervously whether he would have
time to whisk a certain black bottle and
well-thumbed pack of cards off the table
before her eyes would fall upon them.
“ Confound jessup! ”

   “ You are fifty miles from the railroad
here, are you not? " asked the girl. The
icv wind snatched the words from her lips
So greedily that Porter scarcely caught
them. “ I don’t know how you manage
to exist. It is so desolate and dreary.”

   “ It is better in the spring,” said the
young man hurriedly. “ You would not
think what a difference there could be.
I’ll admit that there is little cheerful-
ness even about ‘ Our Lady of the
Snows ’ now. The night and the snow
have veiled much of her beauty. But in
the spring she is very gay, you know.
Then her mantle is blue, with wild lark-
spur, and she wears a wreath of deep-
red wild-roses like a string of coral about
her throat. There used to be a tiny mis-
sion tucked away in the canon at her
feet, but it was abandoned long ago.”

  She stared at him through the dark-
ness, striving vainly to see his features.

  “ My name in Margaret Loomis,” she
said. “ We ought never to have under-
taken the journey at this season, but we
were told-”

  Her companion pushed the door of the
cabin open, almost seeming to ignore the
fact that she was talking.

  A bright fire .flared a welcome to them
from the wide hearth, and two lamps
had been lighted. But the absent-mind-
ed Jessup had evidently forgotten the
palpable tokens of his own and his
friend’s depravity. The cards still lay
face upward on the table, and the half-
emptied bottle of whisky was still very
much in evidence. Jessup himself was
not visible.

 “ He—my friend—may be helping
Pete with the team,” said Porter, try-
ing to appear at ease and agonizedly
conscious that the eyes of the older wom-
an were resting frostily and accusingly
upon the damning articles lying on the
table. He was keenly sensible that any
attempt at apology would only make mat-
ters worse.

  The two women took the seats which
he placed for them near the leaping
flame, and they both—the younger es-
pecially—showed a decided inclination
to maintain a dignified reserve—even
with erring compatriots of her own.

  “ I am horribly tired.” she said to her
companion in a low voice. “ You may
tell them—these people—as much or as
little as you like, dear. I think that

I	should like to lie down at once, if you
do not mind.”

  Young Porter had been dragging
things about clumsily behind a gaudy
print curtain that concealed one-half the
cabin from view.

  “ We have few visitors here,” he said
apologetically, emerging with a very red
face from behind it. “ An occasional

cowboy- I am afraid that the very

best that we can do will be bad enough,
after all. But if the young lady cares

to rest-”

  The girl thanked him with a rather
watery smile.

  “ I have understood that visitors are
always welcome in the West.” she said in
a forlorn little voice. “ We are very-
grateful to you for your hospitality, I
am sure, Mr. Porter.”

  She vanished behind the flimsy curtain
ablaze with flaming poppies and gay with
green roses as she spoke.

  “ The child is tired out,” remarked the
okier woman briefly. “ Tea? Oh, I

think not, thank you. 1 seldom drink
it.”

   Porter, still slightly mystified by Jes-
sup's unaccountable absence, placed food
upon the table a little absently.

  “ I am sorry that I cannot offer you
more,” lie said shyly. “ A half-breed
does the most of our cooking for u*—

and she is away now. I dare say-"

  Mrs. Norris eyed him coldly.

  “ 1 had better come to the point at
once, if we are to understand each other,
I suppose," she said coldly. “ Mr. Por-
ter, we—my niece and I—are looking for
a lad who left home two years ago in a

fit of perversity. The stage-drivcr-”

  A sound behind him made Porter turn
sharply.

  “Oh, it’s you, is it?” lie said to Jes-
sup, who was shaking the loose snow
from his wide-brimmed hat. “ I couldn't
think what on earth had become of you.”
Jessup looked beyond him at the wom-
an still seated at the table. She faced
them both alike with level, uninterested
gaze.

  “ One of the horses had cast a shoe,”
he explained monotonously. “ I had to
help Pete about it a little.”

  Mrs. Norris had bowed to him coldly
enough. Evidently she was not prepared
to take him as readily into her good
graces as she had taken his friend.

  “ 1 thought at first that the stage-
driver might be able to tell us what we
wanted to know,” she said slowly, re-
verting to the subject again. “ He looked
as if he might. But he turned glum of
a sudden and would say just nothing at
all.”

  “ Pete is a half-breed,” remarked Por-
ter explanatorily. “ They are shy, you
know, and quick to take alarm when they
are questioned. And mostly they are gov-
erned by a vague sense of honor, and
there is a certain crude code to which
they conform. Perhaps Pete suspected
that you were asking questions—which
you had no right to ask.”

   She flushed.

  11	The lad for whom we are searching
left home over two years ago, as I have
said,” she repeated. “ He went away
because of a miserable mistake—a mis-
understanding with my brother. It

seems-"

  “ Are you speaking of—the young

lady’s brother?” There was a vague
change in Porter’s voice.

  111	am speaking of my niece’s cousin—
the lad to whom she was engaged. You
see, my brother was an old man, and a
sum of money was missing. He was very
generous with his nephew; generous to

the point of insanity / think, and-"

 “Well?”

  “ Well, my brother awakened one day,
as I have said, with a large sum of money
missing, and there was Meg with a dia-
mond which must have cost an extrav-
agant sum flashing on her finger; a stone
which no one but a rich girl had any
right to wear."

  “ Had he given it to her? ”

  “ Most certainly. Who else could
have done so? That was not the ques-
tion, however. The foolish boy chose
to deny that my brother's money had paid
for it—chose, indeed, to refuse to answer
any of the questions which he asked. Af-
ter that it seemed that there was nothing
that could be done to bring about a rec-
onciliation between the two. My brother
refused to prosecute, but the search for
the money was at once abandoned and
the breach remained absolute. The stub-
born lad had forfeited the affection of
his guardian and abused the confidence
of the" young girl who had promised to
be his wife. She told him so.”

  Jessup had not seen Margaret Loomis.
Naturally, he was not so interested in
the story as his friend was. ' He stirred
restlessly in his seat.

  “ The lad was as foolish as he was
young. He forgot that his uncle’s bark
was worse than his bite, and that the girl
whom he loved was an impulsive chit
who did not know her own mind ten min-
utes together. He treated them both
to a theatrical display of something that
was half temper and half eloquence and
quitted home in a huff. We have not
seen him since.”

  “ So far the story is a very ordinary
one,” said Porter evasively. “ I fail to
see-”

  The woman laid the bit of untasted
bread back upon her plate. There were
tears in her eyes.

  “ My brother died very recently,” she
said in a low^er voice. “Just before his
deatli he discovered that he had accused
his nephew unjustly, and that another

don’t know where Arthur got the money
that he paid for Margaret's engagement
ring. I don’t care to know, and neither
does she. She is breaking her heart over
the injustice that sent him out in the
world. I am going to help to find him
for her. if I can.”

  For the first time Jessup spoke.

  “ Maybe the way the boy got the mon-
ey was quite as much to his discredit
as you thought, even if your brother was
not the victim,” he said harshly. “ His
flight would certainly indicate it.'’

  " I don't care whether it was or not,”
said the lady, with some agitation. She
wiped her eyes defiantly. " He may have
committed highway robbery for all I
know—er care. I am not going to have
his life ruined or Meg’s heart broken if
I can help it. He is my dead brother's
son. and I think shame to myself and
shame to the dead that we allowed him—
our own lad—to sneak out of his own
house at night like a convicted felon!”
Porter looked helplessly from her to
Jessup and back again.

  “ I don’t see just what help you can
expect from us.” he said undecidedly.

  For the second time the woman showed
traces of impatience.

  “ We heard once that he was out in
this part of the country some where.-' she
said. “ The stage-driver practically ad-
mitted that he had heard of him. And
then, as I have told you. he shut up like
a clam and not another word from him.

  “ ‘ You might ask Porter.' he said at
last, when Margaret could not restrain
her tears. ' You see. he lives where he
gets a sight of just about every stranger
that cocoes int” the country first 3nd last
We call this place the “ Gate of the Bad
Lands.” I don't know whether he knows
anything about it or not. and I can't
promise you that he wiii tell you any-
thing about it even if be doe* kni w.'

  “ Where are you from, young man? "
she asked Jessup suddenly and sharply.

  Jessup reddened. He made a grace-
ful effort, however, to overlook this de-
liberate. if unconscious, breach of the
cardinal, fundamental laws of hospital-
ity. "I am from Arkansas,” he admit-
ted hastily.

  “ You look like it," agreed the woman.
“ You’ve got the same maiaria!- Not

that you can help it. of course. Well, it
seems that neither of you are in-
clined-"

  " 1: isn't a question of inclination," ob-
jected Porter hastily. It has been near-
ly two years, you know. You said that
yourself. And shs.—the girl he lowed—
if she accepted his guilt without a pro-
test-"

  There was a little vague, indeterminate
stir at the door and it fell open.

  A young woman crossed the threshold
noiselessly. The high cheek-bones, the
shy movements, the straight black hair,
the lithe grace of the figure told unmis-
takably of Indian blood. She looked
from one to the other of the little party
in surprise, not unmixed w'ith a tinge of
dread.

  “ This young woman was connected
with the njission of which I spoke to vour
niece just now,” said Porter, bridging
an awkward pause “ She is called in
the language of her people ‘ Swaying
Reed.' She understands English perfect-
ly. so it might be as well-”

  Martha Norris's face did not soften.

  “ What is she doing here? ” she asked
pertinently.

  The Indian woman had looked at her
at first indifferently, and later with some-
thing that was almost like trouble in her
dark eyes. Again she cast a quick, be-
wildered glance from Porter to Jessup,
and then back again to the former.

  “ Shall I go now ? ” she asked sim-
piy-

  Jessup did not answer, but Porter, with
a glance at Mrs. Norris, shook his head.

  “ Not now.” he said simply. “ The
storm is growing worse. I will take you
back a little later myself.”

  But still Jessup neither looked at her
ncr spoke.

  “ I asked you where you came from
on account of your name," said the older
-woman, addressing Jessup again and re-
verting to her grievance. “ Our lad's
mother was a Jessup, from the nonhem
pan of the State. I thought it likely
that you might be related to some of our
people.”

  Jessup stared at her as if fascinated,
bat shook his head.

  “ All the people that I have are in
the West," he said stubbornly.

  He looked across at the half-breed
614

for the first time, but she had averted
her face and her eyes were quite hidden
under their long lashes.

  •' Well, I hope that you will both
think it over,” said the woman, with a
sigh. “ Maybe when you have thought
about it a while it will come to you—
whether you have seen him or not. I
mean. He was always a great hand for
stock of all kinds. When I do find him
1 expect to find him in the cattle busi-
ness. Margaret and I have talked it
over, and we both feel just exactly the
same about it. All that I am afraid

of is-”

  She hesitated.

  “ The Jessups were always fools about
women.” she said regretfully. “If I
were to find Arthur entangled with an

Indian woman-”

 Porter flushed.	,

  " She." he said shortly, referring to the
half-breed girL “ understands English
as well as you do. I guess you have for-
gotten that I told you that just now.
You will remember that I mentioned that
she was educated at the mission. And,
personally. I guess that I might just
as well tell you now. first as last, that in
my opinion the Indian women are, as a
rule, far and away too good for the
white men with whom they associate.”
He hesitated in his turn.

  “ I might tell you about a man whom
I knew once, and who came out West
to the Bad Lands.” he said a little
vaguely. “ He—had got into trouble
of some kind back in the States and had
been run out. Maybe it was his own
fault and maybe it wasn't. I guess that
he was about the only one that could
say as to that. He wasn't a very at-
tractive object when he got here. He
had stopped over in St. Paul or some-
where. and had gone just about all the
gaits. I guess—and a little more. He
wasn't fit for a decent woman to touch
with a pair of tongs.”

  The half-breed had evidently found
tlie presence of the strangers embarrass-
ing. She arose from her seat in the cor-
ner impulsively and with a pleading
word or two in her own tongue, but Por-
ter shook his head and she sank back
again in her place.

He was sick a long tune—some sort
of a malignant fever they thought h was

at first. You see, they couldn't j&l
a doctor. Then smallpox in an es-
pecially nasty form developed. One or
two people had clung to him up to that
time. They left him then—all of them."

  He paused significantly. The Indian
woman sat quite still, as if carved out • f
stone. Her unwinking gaze never for
an instant left the leaping flames. Nor
did Mrs. Norris move. She looked from
one to the other of the young men dully.
And behind the dividing curtain a little
current of air set the poppies nodding
feverishly and caused die painted roses
to lift their fading heads. Only Jessup
looked at none of them. His clenched
right hand, thrown across the table, un-
clenched slowly and nervelessly. He did
not speak.

  “ There was one creature, a woman—
scarcely better than a child—to whom
this man (he might have been the neph-
ew of whom you spoke, this type
of the eternally masculine) had been
kind. I do not know in what way. He
was not bad to look upon at the very first
before the fever struck him down, and
it may be that he had tossed her a kind
word now and then as you might toss a
bone to a starving dog. But when the
others had quitted him and left him to
die, as not even a decent dog is left, she
went to his relief.

   Maybe you don't know what she
braved—maybe 1 don't. The Indian is a
bundle of contradictions, sometimes, even
to those who know him liest. And. mir.d
you. this girl had no exaggerated illu-
sions in the matter. She knew exactly
what she had to expect when she watched
the lodge-poles of her father’s teepee
fall that cool morning and saw his slim-
legged children, brown and sinewy,
break the trail, matted with kinnikinick
and Oregon-grape that lay northward.

  “ Deliberately she shut her eyes on
the mist that closed down over the faint,
far-away trail, to the distant tangling
smoke that columned upward and came
to her with a personal message; delib-
erately she would not breathe the tang
of the wo-xi-fire, the scent of salmon
broiling on the coals, the odor of the
tamarack, ar.d the bruised fruit of the
Oregon-grape; deliberately she closed
her ears to the thousand sounds of the
forest that called to her.

   ' She went inside the white man’s cab-
in, looked down upon what had once
been a man, and closed the door behind
her.

  “ She stayed there eight weeks. Part
of the time, when delirium held its vic-
tim strongest in its ruthless hold, she
suffered actual abuse at his hands. It is
easy to strike, you know, when there is
no resistance. Her wrists and hands were
black and bruised. Once when she re-
sisted liis attempts to rise from his bed
he struck her savagely—a brutal blow in
the face with his clenched fist.

  “ It left a mark that she will carry
to her grave. She was always his in-
ferior—admittedly. Sometimes—rarely,
for he talked little—he raved of the girl
who had cast him off for a trifle. His
blows left physical scars; his words left
spiritual disfigurements that will last
until death—and after.

  “ He began to grow better finally,
thanks to her care and nursing. The
fever left him weak mentally as well
as physically. The others of her race
and his did not return.

  “ Then winter came again, and if
they were to live through the long
months, when the ice slowly choked the
raucous cry of the Yellowstone into a
feeble whimper, there was much to do.
And she, never strong, was enfeebled
by the long confinement and by the dis-
ease that, taken in a milder form than
his own, had fed upon her childish
frame. And during all this time he
never—I have had it from his own lips—
gave her one loving word. She never
asked for one.

  “ The winter deepened, and her people
came back into the sheltered little val-
ley under the smile of Our Lady of the
Snows. The first voice she heard—the
first face she saw—I think that I will
spare you that. I will not tell yon what
either brought her.

  “ But a day came, she had worked
hard and was tired, when something
happened. She had been engaged in
the most menial tasks—the gathering of
fagots to keep the dogs of cold at bay
through the long winter, and had strayed
some distance from home. Coming
hack that day when the twilight was al-
most gone, she found a tiny pool of al-
kali water fringed about with thin,

starved grasses that the ice had never
"Hound.

   “ She stared down into the clear mir-
 ror, and the slender vestige of vanity
 and self-respect that his treatment and
 open contempt had left her took flight
 forever. The Indian woman loses youth
 and good looks early enough at best, and
 the half-breed—that alien blossom of
 ill-nourished soil—withers usually long
 before the flower is perfected. It was
 a woman of middle age, haggard and
 tired and faded and ugly, who looked
 back at her from the little mirror set in
 the silver frame of frosted alkali

   “ I have no idea of what she was
thinking as she went back to the cabin
that night. Only God, who is very mer-
ciful to the women of His sinful world
and who of all people need mercy most,
can know!

   “ It was very late when she opened
 the door of the little cabin, and he had
 grown tired waiting for her. He was
 hungry and cold and lonely. Remem-
 ber, I am not trying to excuse him. He
 was not trying to excuse himself when
 he told her about it later. She crept about
 her delayed tasks in the Indian way with
 his brutal words stinging her.

   “ She was so engrossed that some one
 had called outside more than once be-
 fore either of them heard it. He did not
 raise his head when she looked at him
 appealingly—it was one of his glum
 days—and she opened the door hurried-
 ly herself.

   “ The moon was shining, and above
 the toil and fret and trouble Our Lady
 of the Snows looked down with some-
 thing of the same vague pity that her
 gentle heart had held even in the midst
 of her own sorrow when she looked at
 those who hung one upon either side of
 Her Son upon the trees that bore such
 strange, unnatural fruit that morning
 long ago upon that nameless hill above
 the garden.

   “ * Hello! ’ the voice called again.

   “‘What do you want?’ It was the
impatient voice of the man behind her.
He pushed her roughly aside.

   “ ‘ I want to know who lives here and
 if you are the party I want. I am look-
 ing for a fellow that lives somewhere in
 the valley. A squaw-man-’

 any use going on. He left her next day.
 And you can see just about what it must
 have meant to her. She was not all
 Indian, you know. There were the long
 months at the mission, and her white
 blood. And there was another element
 to reckon with, unfortunately.

 “She loved him—God knows why!
Women are made that way. And she
was just Indian enough to snatch up the
gift that another woman had thrown
away, and just enough to suffer—suf-
fer! "

  Jle looked curiously over his shoul-
der. There had been no sound behind
him. but Margaret Loomis stood there,
white and motionless, the gaudy pop-
pies no longer flaunting, lying frost-bit-
ten against her colorless face. She did
not speak.

  She only stared at Porter, and from
him to Jessup, with a growing horror
of comprehension in her face.

  As for Jessup, even Porter, who had
fancied that he knew the man—his faults
and weaknesses—as no one else did
or could, looked at him as at the face
of an utter stranger. The wind out-

side had strengthened, and the whisper
of the snow upon the window had
changed to the hurtling mutter of sleet.
The sound had a chord of summons in
it, steadfast and clear as the note of a
bugle.

  The fire on the hearth had died down
just a little, and the flickering sparks
were no longer like the flicker of the
fireflies of a brooding Southern night,
or if so, it was that of a night whose
moon had gradually gone down at mid-
night.

  Then Jessup rose, and slipping the
resisting hand of the Indian woman in
his, turned and faced the others.

  “ I have been a brute," he said. “ and
worse. I have sunk to depths of cow-
ardice of which even the most craven of
wretches never dreamed. I thank you.
Porter, for your words of to-night. In
uttering them you have cancelled every
debt that you ever owed me.

  “ I may be lacking in the elements
of a hero, but I will no longer forget my
manhood, so help me God! Aunt Mar-
tha—Margaret—you will allow me to
present my wife! ”

SYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS CHAPTERS.

ARTHUR DALE, artist, on returning, one night, to his cottage in the Scotch High-
lands, setjs before his door a packing-case, in which, when he opens it, he finds, to his
horror, the apparently lifeless body of a young girl. He succeeds, however, in resus-
citating her, but she, upon regaining consciousness, is unable to remember even so much
as her own identity, much less the scries of events which preceded her mysterious arrival.
The mist becomes so thick that it is impossible to leave the cottage that night, so the girl
retires to sleep in the loft. Dale goes out for a moment, and on returning is greeted by
the sight of a stranger loading a revolver in front of his fire. This is Sir George Belville,
who tells Dale that he is in search of four strangers who have been seen about the moors.
Dale distrusts Belville, believing him io be involved in the packing-case mystery, and his
suspicions become stronger when Sir George, suddenly dashing out into the night, disap-
pears in the fog and a sound of firing begins. Dale rushes out also, and when he again
returns finds three more strange men in the house, one of whom, dressed as a groom,
threatens him with a revolver and admits knowing all about the box, but believer that it
contained a lifeless body, and insists on being led to where Dale has buried it. D.ile, pre-
suming it best to allow the groom to remain deceived, agrees to lead them to the place.
The girl, in the loft, makes a slight noise, and Dale, upon being questioned, says that it is
his wife. The groom says she must come. too. The two other men attempt to get into the
loft, but the trap-door leading up has evidently been fastened down. While they are
working to force it the girl, who has escaped by a window, opens' the cottage-door from
the outside. Dale knocks down the groom, and with the girl runs out into the fog.
There they encounter a regular running fight, in which Sir George and his servant. Mon-
tague, are pitted against the groom and his followers. After a series of adventures. Dale
leads the exhausted and fainting girl back lo the cottage, where, in a pool of blood 011 the
floor, is the groom—dead. And in death the fact is disclosed that it is a woman in man’s
clothes.

CHAPTER VI.

ABDUCTION.

DALE relighted the candle and sur-
veyed the gruesome sight. It
was as horrible as anything he
had ever looked upon, and he
was more than glad that the girl, in her
faint, was saved from seeing it.

   With little liking for the task, he took
up the body of the unfortunate woman
and carried it outside to the rear of the
cottage, where lie left it beside the mys-
terious packing-box. In his mind was
the conviction that the dead woman was
immediately concerned with the events
which must-have preceded the arrival of
the box, and as he walked back to the

* Began March A 11 - S t 0 r y M

house he rejoiced, almost, at the divine
retribution which had overtaken the
vicious little groom.

  After putting the room in somewhat
decent order and removing or hiding the
signs of the tragedy, Dale for the third
time set about reviving the girl. Grad-
ually, under his ministrations, she re-
turned to consciousness. Dale watched
her heavy eyelids flutter.

  “ Is that you. uncle?” she murmured.
“ 1 was dreaming of the Princess. Why,
where’s your beard?" Then with a sud-
den start she seemed to realize all that
had happened. “ Oh.” she cried,
“ where are they? Are we safe?”

  “You remember?” he asked eagerly,
imagining that at last iiB-it was to be

thrown on the mystery in which he was
involved. “ You remember, don’t you ? ”
She made a gesture of despair.

  “ It has gone from me again," she
said dully. “ For a moment I knew.
For a moment I remembered. There
was an old white-bearded man. There
was a woman, a dark woman—but it’s
all gone from me now.”

  And. she shook her head, gazing into
his eyes with dumb anguish that cut into
his heart.

  “ Let me go.” she cried suddenly,
springing to her feet. “I'm sure I'm a
crazy woman. Let me go. Why should
you be troubled with my madness? ”

  “ Have you so soon forgotten," he
asked, taking her hands. “ what we said
to each other out there in the mist? ”

  “ It's not possible; indeed it’s not,”
she panted, trying hard to release her-
self. “ How can you care for one who
can’t even tell her own name? ”

  “If that’s all,” he answered tenderly,
“ I'll give you a name. To me you. shall
be always 1 Beloved.’ ”

  She did not speak, but presently he
found that she was weeping, and though
he did his best to soothe her, it was long
before her sobs ceased; but at last weari-
ness overcame her and she fell asleep
in his arms. He laid her again on the
settle, then went outside and sat down
with his back against the door.

  His thoughts were many and strange.
He knew it to be a black business, un-
doubtedly concerned with attempted
murder, and now, probably, with abduc-
tion. The people of whom she had
spoken—the Princess, her uncle, the old
man with the white beard; those
whom he had seen—Belville, Montague,
Wilkes, and the quasi-groom—were they
all her enemies? Were any of them her
friends ?

  It was imperative that they get to a
town of some size and consult authori-
ties, and so, about sunrise, after long
hours of thinking and dozing, he went
to rouse the girl. It took a deal of
knocking to wake her, but finally he
heard her sleepy voice asking what was
the trouble.

  He answered that it was morning and
time they were away, and heard her,
after a moment’s silence, give a little
sobbing exclamation, as though the mem-

ory of the events through which she had
so recently passed had rolled back upon
her mind. He knocked again, and told
her that in the chamber above she would
find such toilet requisites as he possessed
—at any rate, clean towels and a hand-
basin.

  It was not long before they were tak-
ing a hasty meal.

  The girl was.weary and nervous; her
face pallid, her eyes rimmed, yet it was
borne in upon Dale that he bad absurdly
underestimated her charms, for though
before he had thought her lovely—an ad-
jective he perceived inadequate—now
indeed she was a beautiful woman. He
did not realize that love had touched his
eyes with tender exaggeration.

  The meal w-as silent, the girl hardly-
speaking, Dale almost as quiet, for in
his heart the young artist was praying
very fervently that she might never have
cause to regret his advent into her life.

  As soon as they had finished, they
started off. over the rough track, to the
village. The walking was hard, and the
girl still tired and somewhat lame; yet
they made fair time, and in an hour or
so were at the village inn, a small estab-
lishment, hardly more than a public-
house. The landlady, however, was a
decent, pleasant woman, and in her
charge Dale placed the girl "while he
went to find the village police (in regard
to the death, of the groom), and to the
railroad station.

  “ There’s no train,” said the landlady,
“ for twa hour or mair."

  " I’m going to order a special,” said
Dale impatiently. “ The lady’s business
is too serious for a moment’s delay. See
that you make her comfortable, and al-
low no one to trouble her.”

  He went away, assuring the girl, who
was clearly ill at ease at being left alone,
that he would not be long, but, as it hap-
pened. fully three-quarters of an hour
had passed before he returned. He had
had some trouble in arranging for the
special train, but at last was able to
make his way back to the inn with the
knowledge that they were already get-
ting up steam in an asthmatic old
freight-engine, which would be ready for
him by the time he returned with his
companion.

  In the hall of the inn Dale met the
ENSHROUDED.

619

landlady. Her air of subdued anxiety
struck an instant chill into his heart.

  “ What’s happened ? ” he demanded.

  “ Weel, sir,” replied the woman, “ ye
st;c the bonny young leddy’s fayther-”

  “Father!1, interrupted Dale. “Did
she know him?”

  “Ken her ain fayther?” echoed the
landlady wonderingly. “ 'Twould be a
sorry lassie that didna, sir; but I didna
ken, for I just telt him whaur she war
an’ in he went. But I thocht I heard a
cry a while sine."

  Dale, when the thought came to him
that this was but another seeking to
harm the girl, was swamped in a wave of
impotent anger and discouragement.

  11	Woman, what have you done?” he
groaned.

  “ What’s ailin’ ye?” she asked him.
“ Would ye hae me keep the bit lassie
frae her ain fayther?”

  He didn't answer, but with bitter self-
reproach that he should have allowed
the girl for even one moment out of his
sight went blindly toward the room
where he had left her. The door was
bolted on the inside, and when lie called
there was no answer.

  His pale face grew still paler, and
disregarding the shrill outcry of the
landlady, he drew back a few feet, and
putting down his shoulder, hurled him-
self with all his might at the panel near-
est the bolt. It gave at once. He
pushed his hand through the splintered
wood, drew back the bolt, and Hinging
the door open, burst into the room.

  A glance showed him that the room
was empty, and so terrible had been the
pictures .conjured up in his mind that
for the moment he felt a certain relief.
A second glance showed a wide-opened
window through which exit must have
been made. All his fears came back.
What her enemies had failed to do by
violence they had now effected by guile.

  There was no sign that the girl had
been there; she had vanished as she had
come—without warning. All the love
in Dale’s being cried out at being thus
deprived of its object. He felt his en-
ergy sapped from him as though by an
illness. For a moment lie stood helpless
and uncertain; then determination came
back to him, and again heedless of the
shrill protesting landlady, 1 e leaped

through the open window into the court:
yard.

  Here his fierce, stammering queries,
that half-frightened the rustics, revealed
that two strangers, a man and a girl, had
been seen walking away a short time
before.

  He listened impatiently till they be-
gan to repeat themselves, then hurried

C horse from the inn stable, and jumping
pon it, galloped off in the direction the
rustics had indicated; then he tore
through the village, beating his old
mount till it reached an acme of fear
unknown to it since colthood and setting
all the population agape.

  The road they were on led only to ?
bare moor, he knew, where he could
surely overtake them. So confident was
he that at the foot of every rise he more
than half expected that upon reaching
the summit he would come up with the
fugitives. As he rounded the shoulder
of a hill he noticed, without paying
much attention, the faint odor of gas-
eous smoke; then as he turned into the
open and came out with the wide moor
on his left a groan of utter disappoint-
ment burst from his lips.

  Not three hundred yards away was a
large motor-car, in which were seated
two men; between them, with drooping
head and rounded shoulders, was the
huddled form of the girl lie sought.
The car was moving slowly, but as he
appeared ran up its speed, and in less
than a minute it was more than half a
mile away, the puffing of its motor com-
ing back faintly to his ears, the dust
rising in a dun cloud behind it.

  Dale's first impulse was to pursue.
Then, grimly laughing at his idiocy, he
pulled up short.

  Broken in spirit, he slouched deject-
edly on his useless horse and watched
the girl disappear.

       CHAPTER VII.

SIR GEORGE’S SLAVE.

   For a while he stared after the car as
it drew away, now scurrying along the
edge of the heath, now burrowing down
out of sight beyond the hills and rises,
to come up again in a cloud of dust and
steam.

  In the end he jerked arcrond the head

of hit disgusted horse and was about to
gallop back to town, when he heard his
name called and saw hurrying toward
him two men.

  Of these, one was Montague, Belville's
servant, as demure and decorous as ever;
the other was Wilkes, late subordinate
to the dead groom. When last Dale had
seen them they had been in deadly con-
flict with each other; now they appeared
to be comrades. Wilkes reached the
road first, and came to a halt in front
of the rider, who looked down at him
uncertainly and angrily.

  “ Beg pardon, but this 'ere bloomin’
gent want? to speak to you.” said Wilkes,
panting after his run. Then he added,
with an affable nod at Dale's unfettered
hands: “ See you’ve got 'em off then.
Reg'lar 'orrid feelin'. ain't it? But,
'Eavins. we done it tender, long the wye
them peelers 'andle a bloke.”

  “What do you want?” asked Dale
impassively, speaking over Wilkes's head
to Montague, who had by that time come
up.

  " Sir George Belville's compliments,
sir." said the man. his face as unexpres-
sive and immobile as ever, “ and he is
arranging to have you hanged for mur-
der unless you promise not to interfere
any longer in this matter.”

  Dale gasped.

 “ Are vcu crazv?" he started.
“ Why-

  “ I can't answer for myself, sir.” re-
plied the mar., with a momentary lifting
of his strangely pale eyes. “ but my mas-
ter is quite sane. I am to make you un-
derstand. sir, that he is arranging to
have you arrested for murder unless you
promise to leave here at once, to preserve
silence about all that has passed, and to
resign the young lady to his care. Sir
George bids me add that his only desire
is to save and protect the young lady
from a certain great peril that menaces
her."

  “ I can believe your last lialf-dozen
words,” said Dale, watching him keenly
to see if he was aware of the girl's dis-
appearance. “ But the lady you speak
of is—there." He turned and pointed
to the motor-car that was now but a
moving dot far down the rough moor
track.

  Montague coughed and raised his
hand to his mouth. Dale thought he
grinned as well as coughed under the
cover of his palm.

  It was Wilkes who finally spoke, and
he said:

  “ Blimee. d’^ ye’ mean to sve they've
got 'er agyne?"

  " Who are they?” asked Dale, and
then, as Montague hesitated to reply, he
added earnestly: “ If she is in any real
danger I wish you would tell me.' Give
me some idea, at least."

  “ In danger, ye?," Montague answered
slowly. " but not immediately. I should
judge, unless their hands are forced by
publicity. Especially she should be safe,
if it's true, as you say, that her memory's
lost. After all, I don’t suppose they
have any wish to kill her if they can
manage without."

  Dale leaned down to Montague.

  “ I’ll give you,” he said. “ a hundred
pounds if you'll tell me all you know
about this matter.”

  Wilkes, who had been craning his
neck to hear this last sentence, for all—
or perhaps because it was clearly not in-
tended for his ears—gave vent to a long
whistle.

  “ Lor love ye.” he said. “ I'll tell all
I know for a fiver."

  But Montague shook his head in
silence, and for the nest few minutes
stood quiet, his mind, evidently, far away
in thought. Dale stared at him. won-
dering what sort of man he might have
been before he became mixed up with
this Belville. After a while he grew
restless.

  " Well," he said, “ I suppose you're
as big a rogue as your master. Give
him my compliments and tell him that
within an hour or so I shall be on my
way to the police to tell them the full
facts. Then I think he will be com-
pelled to give the explanation he now
refuses. Up at my cottage there is
something that cannot well be hidden."

  Montague looked up at him suddenly.

  “ But you see you ain't got no cottage
now.” snickered Wilkes.

  Dale jerked round and stared at him.
The man was grinning inanely.

  " Yes. sir.” supplied Montague,
“ Wilkes and myself have just been burn-
ing your cottage down.’’
ENSHROUDED

621

   “But what for?" The colossal nerve
 of the thing, somehow, struck a humor-
 ous chord in Dale's make-up rather than
 one of anger. He almost could have
 smiled.

    " We buried the body, too, sir." Mon-
 tague continued deferentially. “ and took
 the liberty of placing beside it a long
 sharp knife of yours which we found, in
 order that it might seem to be the
 weapon with which the woman was
 killed.

    ■' At present Sir George is. I believe,
 drawing up the story Wilkes and I are
 to swear to. It is to be represented. I
 understand, that—well, I won't go into
 detail. Suffice it that the story is dis-
 tinctly disagreeable and wilL I imagine,
 prove detrimental to both your good
 name and to your health."

    Dale listened, numb with wonder.

    His sensation of amusement was rap-
 idly changing to one of helpless wrath.
 He knew himself to be powerless, and
 as the fulness of Belville'> intentions
 came to him he pictured the future very-
 black before him. Besides the personal
 danger and harm of the story, it flashed
 across him, too. that if he were entangled
 in such a mesh of lies he would be able
 , to do little for the girl.

   He could not. he believed, cope at
 the same time with her enemies and with
 this accusation against him. Neverthe-
 less. he answered:

    “ I shall tei! my story regardless, and
 I think it will be the more plausible.
 The truth is apt to hang together better
 than a fabric of lies.”

   “ Ah "—Montague bowed apologetic-
 ally—" there I must beg to differ, sir.
 Your statement will not hold when the
 lies are being woven by a gentleman so
 proficient in prevarication as my mas-
 ter.'

   “ A gent," added Wilkes, “ with a
 nat'ral-bora gift Fr it. Such a gift! "

    He rolled his eyes in an ecstacy of ad-
 miration. and then, looking at Dale, went
 through an unpleasant pantomime of
 choking, with his head lolling on one
 side.

   “ Of course," resumed Montague.
 “ Sir George’s plans may have altered
 now that the lady is no longer in your
 care."

    Dale nodded in reply.

  Th re seemed to be little to say. He
was clearly fighting with odds against
him: against one. at least, who could
outd* him at every turn when it cam?
to ingenious perversions of the truth . id
shady machinations. How could lie
best save the girl, who, with her lack of
memory, was as great a hindrance as an
aid?

  Montague watched him in silence, the
light of constrained passion behind his
strange eyes glowing with an intensity
of hidden feeling. It seemed as if he
guessed the artist's thoughts, for he
waved Wilkes aside and said in a
per:

    Mr. Dale, your best chance of help-
ing her is to keep at liberty Belville's
chief idea is to get you out of the way;
but now that she has disappeared asain.
his plans, as I said, may change. Let me
advise you. ^Come and -ee him before
acting in this matter. I think he will
lie wiling to postpone anything in order
to rescue her from the Princess.”

  "From the Princess?" repeated Dale
sharply; then he went on: “If you're
honest, if you’re at all friendly, why
can’t you tell me what you know? How
can I judge what is best for her ^-hiie
I'm so mazed ? "

  “ Sir George's heel is on my neck." re-
plied the other, with an inexpressible
plav of emotions across his mask-like
face. “ I am his slave—body and soul
he owns me. and makes me do what he
wills me to do. If I dared. I would
act readily- enough, but I daren't.”

  He spoke with a great bitterness, and
Dale felt again even more acutely, how
formidable was his adversary, who could
reduce men ta such complete and loath-
some subjection.

  “ What are you afraid of? " he a-ked.
but the other only shivered for ar.*-.ver.

  “ Fight him in the dark." he broke
out; "that's your only chance. \our
story is too strange to be believed, espe-
cial'iy with Sir George weaving lies about
you. Agree with him now and bide your
time or you will deprive the girl of one
of the only two frieuds she has in the*
world."

  “Two friends5 said D3;e swiftly.
'• Who is the other? "

  " I." said the man.

  “ You ?" Dale almost laughed in his
6i2

face. “ You don’t expect to be believed,
do you ? "

  The other shrugged his shoulders.

  ’ Oh, no.” he said, with apathy, then
L.s voice changed, grew small and hard.
'• But 1 tell you, and swear it by my
hate for this man Belville, that I hug to
ray soul by day and by night, that your
best chance of helping and saving that
girl is to ostensibly yield to Sir George
and work with him till the time comes.
Till the time comes," be repeated.

  Dale hesitated for a moment. Mon-
tague was very likely right. So-

  “Take me to him," he said. “At
leas: I'll find out what he has to say be-
fore I go to the police."

  Montague changed again. Dale was
beginning to feel him an emotional
weathercock.

  “ Look here," he cried, throwing his
aims wide, as though in an appeal—
“ look here: I beg of you that, if you
value your life, you’ll go on 3 sketching
tour to Italy for the next sis months or
a year. Don't match yourself between
these two. the Princess and Sir George."

  “ Toat advice." said Dale. “ I think
I shall not follow."

  “ You don't know Sir George," said
Montague, with a sigh. “ He will get
his grip on you as he has on me. It
would be like Brute Belville just for the
fun of it to make you best man at his
wedding, to stand by and watch while
he married the girL"

  “ Now." cried Dale, stung to fury by

the suggestion. “ by my honor-"

  “ Ah." interrupted Montague, “ I
swore that oath once."

  " As I'm a man." said Dale. “ I-"

  " I. too," interrupted Montague again,
“ was once a man."

  " 'Yell, take me to him,” exclaimed
the artist, with an angry gesture.

CHAPTER VIII.

A TREATY OF ALLIAJfCE.

  It was to a «mall shoo ting- lodge that
Tlale was conducted by Montague, who
now had suddenly reverted to the demure
and respectful man servant, interlarding
his conversation with “sirs" and much
hat-touching, and seemingly quite oblivi-
ous to the fact that a while before he had

displayed a different side to his char-
acter.

  He was shown into a very comfortable
and neatly arranged little sitting-room,
where a fire burned cheerily in the
grate. He sa: down, wondering a gcod
deal what was going to happen, for after
his first impulse to accede to Montague's
suggestion it had occurred to him that
he was acting rashly in thus visiting alone
and unarmed a man as desperate and
unscrupulous as Belville seemed to be.

  His cogitations were broken into, how-
ever, by the sound of the baronet's voice,
very loud and fierce. There came an-
other voice, as though in extenuation,
the cracking sound of a blow, and 3
heavy falL Dale sprang to his feet as
the door burst open, and Belville, his
handsome face black with wrath, his left
arm in a siing, came furiously into the
room and ran straight at him.

  “ You fool," he screamed. “ Do you
mean you've lost her? ” He raised his
arm as though to strike.

  “ Look out," warned Dale, in a low
voice, while through the open door he
watched Montague, who with a dazed
look on his white and bleeding face
crawled to his feet. Belville's hand went
down, and he turned away, evidently in
disgust. When he faced Dale again his
features were less contorted, though he
was anything but pleasant t,o look upon.

  " I thought it was all over, and now
it seems that things are worse off than
ever. What happened? How were you
fool and coward enough to lose her? ”

  “ If explanations are to be given,"
said Dale. “ I think you might begin.”

  " You fool, you utter fool, explain to
you? Why, I’ve only to lift my fingers
and you’ll swing from the gallows.’’

  “ That sounds very pretty, but I fear
you are oversanguine about my death. It
is possible that I may be put to that
amount of trouble and inconvenience, but
rest assured that I shall take care that

you-"

  Belville cut him short.

  " While we are fighting each other,
what about this lady, to whom the first
sign of publicity may be fatal? "

  “ Why? "

  “ Because the dead are more easily
hidden than the living."

  There was a quality in his tones that

frightened Dale. The threat aimed at
himself he could afford to disregard.
Formidable as it was, he felt competent
to defend himself. But how if in his
blindness and ignorance he should take
steps that might seem beneficial only to
prove fatal to the unknown girl whom
he loved ? "

“Why can’t you tell me?” he broke
out. “ I don’t know how to treat you.

I only know I mistrust you.” He
paused; then, with a quick gesture of his
hands, exdaimed: “ Who is this lady? ”
“ She is the lady,” replied Belville,
“ whom T intend to marry.”

  “ That, at least, is untrue,” was Dale’s
retort.

  The other started with an angry ex-
clamation, and his piercing eyes became
fixed on the young artist. Then he
flung.back his head and laughed.

  "Sits the wind in that quarter?” he
jeered. “ My good fellow, put such
ideas oat of your head. That the lady-
shall become my wife I have sworn the
most solemn oath a man can take.”

  “ Fortunately,” observed the other,
“ from what I have seen of Sir George
Belville a broken oath more or less can
matter very little."

  He turned and walked toward the
door.

  Belville waited till his hand was on
the knob: then he called to him:

  " Where are you going?"

  “To the police, since you’ll tell me
nothing. It will be strange if they can't
find out something about all this.”
Belville caught him up with:

  “ And while they're trying to find out,
what will be happening to the poor
girl you've allowed to slip into her
enemies' hands?’’

  " I see no other way to help her." said
Dale simply.

  “ Have you forgotten that I told you
that the first hint of publicity will almost
certainly cause her immediate death?"

  “ How have I the slightest idea that
you are telling the truth?"

  The other didn't answer, but rocked
on his heels before the fireplace, his eyes
staring through Dale and out of the
window beyond him. Finally he said,
his voice a little softened:

  “ Because I love her.”

  Dale winced.

  “ All my life long I’ve loved two
things—my own pleasure and power over
other men. Now it seems I must love
a slip of a white-faced girl. The more
fool I for my pains.”

  He fell silent again. Dale was torn
between a desire to spring 3: him and
finish him for good and all and a sort
of admiration for the man’s love, which,
when he gave voice to it, sounded sincere.
Here was a rival, Dale thought, whom,
were he an honest man. it would be
worth while defeating.

  Belville broke into his thoughts with:
“ It’s the princess, of course, who has
her.”

  It had been so useless in the past to
find out just who was this princess that
Dale, though itching with curiosity, let
the remark go.

  “ Speculation,” went on the other, “ is,
however, useless. The practical question
is to rescue her.”

  “The police?” Dale reiterated.

  “Oh, tut! How often have I said to
you this morning that police interference
is impossible. What sense, moreover, in
pitting them against one of the keenest
braids in Europe. I’m not desirous of
having the authorities meddling in this,
anyway. It's too delicate an affair.” He
paused again and looked keenly at Dale.

  “ My dear sir,” he said suddenly, “ if
I should propose a treaty of alliance.

what-”

  “Alliance? With you?” Dale gasped
at the assurance of the man. "If you
were to propose such a treaty with me I
should know, Sir George, that you were
planning some fresh villainy against me."

  " Not till she was safe.” said the other,
with a somewhat sardonic grin. “ 1
am sufficiently in love with that girl to
be honest in getting her. if I can get
her no way else. Can't you see I love
her? ”

  As he spoke there was truth in his ey: «
and in his voice.

  “ I love her, too," said Dale quietly,
and if it please Heaven no other man
shall win her.”

  “ I will win her." cried Belville.
“ whether it please or displease Heaven
—or her. Give me your help to save her
now. or death may win her from us
both."

  “ What is it that vou want me to do? ’
(524	THE ALL-STORY MAGAZINE.

  " Return to London; make the ac-
quaintance of the princess. The divinely
dangerous, the audaciously plain, prin-
cess. From her you can get a clue to
the girl's whereabouts. I can't go. The
princess would suspect me. But you—a
total stranger—can, with your youth and
freshness, win where I should fail.”

  “ We should be good friends—good
allies, rather,” said Dale, “ till the lady

we speak of is rescued. After that-’’

  “ After that as good enemies as you
wish,” Sir George finished the sentence.
Dale sat musing in indecision.

  “ How is it,” he asked, after a pause,
“ that that fellow Wilkes seems to be
in your employ now?”

  “ A fellow like that is easily won over
by a well-aimed, steady pistol,” said the
baronet carelessly.

  “ Who was the woman, then? The
one disguised as a groom ? ”

  “ I don’t know,” replied Sir George.
“• I didn't see the body, being too busy
nursing this shoulder, which some one
slipped a knife into. She was an agent
of the princess’s, I fancy.”

  “ I’ve been imagining this morning
that it might have been the princess .her-
self. Who was it killed her?”

  The other shrugged his shoulders; his
face was not pleasant to look upon.

  “ In such affairs all must take their
chance. One strikes practically without
seeing. Besides, how was I to know she
was a woman ? ’’

  The brutality of the man struck Dale
like a blow. The room grew close; he
could feel the perspiration break out all
over his body.

  “ I think I will go,” he said, rising.
“ I think we have talked enough.”
Belville rose. too.

  “ win you go to London to see the
Princess Fianona?" he asked.

  Dale walked past him toward the door
without answering. The baronet, both
amused and annoyed, followed him with
his eyes.

  “ You haven’t told me yet,” he said,
with mock politeness, " whether you
agree to my proposition ? "

  The smile on his face was almost a
leer, so that when Dale turned to him
he could barely keep from shuddering.
Afterward, it seemed to him that perhaps
this smile was what quickened his deci-

sion ; that he felt that the brain behind
it would be less harmful working with
him than against him.

  He didn't hide his disgust when he

answered.

  “ I don’t understand how I can," he
said, ‘‘ but I agree.”

  The baronet bowed. Dale opened the
door and passed out into the hall.

  On his way out of doors he passed the
obsequious Montague, his pale eyes
gleaming over the bandage which hid the
cuts on his face.

CHAPTER IX.

THE CHASE BEGINS.

  A DAY or two after the evelits which
had brought his stay in Scotland to such
a sudden end Dale was back in his rooms
in London, prepared to overcome all
obstacles in his search for the girl.

  That on the whole he had done wisely
in accepting Sir George’s offer he was
now fairly satisfied. After all, he
persuaded himself, he felt no obligation
to avenge the death of the strangely-
disguised woman who had perished in
the fight on the misty hillside, and to
have informed the police would but have
entangled himself in a network of compli-
cations, just when he had need of perfect
freedom of action.

  He quieted that part of his conscience
that questioned his allowing the Scotch
fight to remain hidden from the authori-
ties and turned his attention to his quest.

  His agreement with Sir George had
already proved satisfactory, for he had
received from the baronet a communica-
tion requesting him to go that evening
to the “ Apollo,” a well-known and fash-
ionable restaurant, where arrangements
had been made for him to be introduced
by a certain Major Bennet to the Prin-
cess Fianona.

  At last he was to meet this redoubtable
person, whom now he realized to be the
center of the whole grim business. He
felt hope grow in him, as the chase be-
came warmer, and set out at once to
arrange for an individual hunting party
on his own hook. For this purpose he
made his way riverward and climbed to
the top floor of a dingy building.

  His knock was answered by an un-
ENSHROUDED.

625

healthy-looking elderly clerk who took
his name and then showed him to an in-
ner room, where a little thin man of
tired appearance and bored manner sat
dozing in front of the fire.

  “ Oh. Mr. Dale," he said, looking up
and stiiling a yawn, evidently with some
difficulty. “Take a seat, sir, please;
yes, I had your letter—proud to oblige

any friend of—of-" He rummaged

among his papers in a kind of mild
despair at his own forgetfulness. “ Oh,
yes. of Mr. Rawson."

  It was with quite an air of triumph
at having remembered at last that he
brought out the name of the solicitor
who had recommended him to Dale as
the smartest and brightest inquiry agent
in the country.

  “ What can I do for you. sir ? ”

  “You are Mr. Mooney. I presume?"
asked Dale, hesitating a little to intro-
duce the business on which he had come.

  The other nodded.

  “ My name, sir," he said, with a deep
sigh that turned into a yawn, and then
he subsided again into a state of apparent
sleepiness, being, as a matter of fact, not
unused to clients who found it somewhat
difficult to state their business.

  Dale still hesitated, hardly knowing
what to say. Really, his chief idea was
to obtain some reserve force on which
to call in any moment of emergency.

  He felt, too, that at present, while he
and Belville were working together for
one object, it was hardiv fair to go to
any one behind his back: yet he enter-
tained toward the baronet so deep a mis-
trust that he felt their partnership might
be broker, at any minute.

   *' Mr. Rawson.’’ he said at last. “ spoke
very highly of your abilities, Mr. Moo-
ney."

  " Yen- good ot Mr. Rawson." mur-
mured Mooney. “ but perhaps too good.
My ability is slight; what I do best is to
sit still. Most people, you know, find
that impossible."

  “ Well." said Dale, after an ther lent:
pause, during which little Mr. Mooney
appeared lost in meditation. " can you
tell me anything about a lady—the Prin-
cess Fianona ? "

  “ Most dangerous woman ;n Europe.”
replied Mooney, for the first time show-
ing a sign of real animation.

      4	S

  " In what way? "

  “ In every way," replied Mooney, sink-
ing again into his manner of repose.
“ Sometimes, sir, after a good dinner, or
on a warm summer afternoon. 1 permit
myself pleasant dreams of some dav lav-
ing my hands on that woman. But I
never shall. Too much to hope for—
too much to hope for.”

  He gave a profound sigh, as of a
wizened little peri in tail-coat and trou-
sers gazing into a paradise that he knew
was not for him.

  “Not even® by sitting still?" asked
Dale, with a faint smile.

  “ Not even by sitting still,” replied
Mr. Mooney, with undiminished gravity.
“ Hut if it is about her you want my
advice, I can give it you in two words—
steer clear. My fee will be ten guinea-,
please, and you never got more for vour
money, either.”

  “ But unluckily I can't steer clear,
for I am to dine with her this evening."

  “ The ia:j gentleman who dined with

her-" mused Mooney. “ It cost him

three pound ten that night, seven thou-
sand within six rr nths. and a bullet
through his brain before the year was out.
But he hadn't laid out ten guineas to
such good purpose as you. Mr. Dale."

  “ There are circumstances," replied the
young artist, “ tha: make it necessary
for me to see as much of her as I can
at present. But I should like you to
keep a watch on her and all her move-
ments."

  Mr. Mooney rubbed the end of his
nose reflectively and looked more sleepy
than ever.

  “Too vague a commission to have any
good results. Only, as it rather uriously
happens. I am watching her already—-v.
rather, her maid."

  “Oh. Betty Brown, do you mean?"
asked Dale.

  “ Urn." said Mooney, shooting at lt::a
a quick glance from beneath ,.;s hall-
closed lids. " you know somethin*;. ' -a?
Mav I ask who gave vou that mo-
tion ? "

  “Sir George Belville." replied Dai.-,
somewhat hesitatingly.

  “ Oh, Sir George Belviile." -aid
Mooney, and he seemed to sink into re-
flection so deep as to become quite ob-
livious to the presence of his visitor, who
626

presently came to the rather angry con-
"■iusion that there was little help to be
obtained from this sleepy and meditative
person.

  He was just thinking of going, when
Mooney looked up and remarked:

  “ The combination of Princess Fia-
nona. Betty Brown, and Sir George Bel-
ville means trouble for some one Where
those three are gathered together there is
the devil to pay. But I hardly see how
I can help you, sir, unless you're more
explicit.”

  “ I’m afraid 1 can’t tell you more at
present." replied Dale. " I merely wish
you to take what lawyers, I believe, call
a ' watching brief.’ ”

  Mooney shook his head and sighed
deeply.

  “ No man," he murmured, “ can do
good work in the dark.”

  “All I feel at liberty to say is that
I have reason to believe that Princess
Fianona has obtained possession of the
person of a young lady whose very name
I am ignorant of. and I cannot imagine
what aim the princess has to serve.” said
Dale. “ But I do know that there is
some deviltry at work, which I intend
to defeat.”

  “ A hard thing to do,” murmured
Mooney, trying to shift into a more
comfortable position. “ where Sir George
Belville is concerned with the Princess
Fianona. I have much affection for them
both, especially Sir George.

  “ He is a strange man, fir. In times
of war or adventure, or in a position of
danger and responsibility, he might have
made a great name for himself, but as it
is, he is one of the most formidable men
I know of—violent and unscrupulous,
yet oddly checked by a crooked sense of
fair play and sportsmanship.

  “ He would ruin a man by the most
subtle treachery, and yet, face to face
with him, you could be assured he would
not lie to you. though if you were a
woman he would think lying to you the
best joke in the world. On the other
hand, he would probably die rather than
strike a woman, while I have seen him
beat some unfortunate fellow, who he
fancied had been lacking in respect to
him. within an inch of his life.

  “ I tell you this, sir. that you may
realize in how deep water you sail in

the company of Princess Fianona and
Sir George Belville. Two people." lie-
added, with another deep sigh, “ for
whom I have a profound admiration and
affection.”

  “ But you have not told me, yet,
whether you will accept my commis-
sion? "

  “ I fear I can do little for you, sir.
unless you can tel! me more."

  " Do you mind telling me why you
are watching this maid of hers ? ” asked
Dale. “ It is possible there might be
some connection between that and the
affair I have come about.”

  “ Hardly, I think." answered Mooney.
'' but—of course in the strictest confi-
dence, sir—she is wanted by the French
police on a charge cf murdering a
mistress of hers in Paris some years ago.
A Frenchman named Acquin was over
here the other day to identify her, and
she will be extradited, though at present
some legal hitch in France is causing
delay.

  “ In a panic lest she should escape
during this delay, the murdered woman's
relatives have telegraphed to me to
watch her, and on the whole I am’
inclined to think Miss Betty Brown's
head ought to feel rather loose. Can you
give me a couple of days to consider your
commission?"

  Dale agreed and went away. Scarcely
had he gone when Mr. Mooney slipped
into his outer office.

  “ Parsons," he said to the clerk, “ how
is my charity account?”

  “ You are about seventy pounds to the
good, sir.” replied the clerk, after re-
ferring to a ledger.

  “ Oh, very satisfactory indeed.” smiled
Mr. Mooney. “ Parsons."

   •' Yes. sir.”

  “ Book a bet of a hundred to three
that Princess Fianona will liave Mr.
Dale her slave, ready to kiss her feet at
her nod, within—within—well, we”.!
give him three months. Parsons.”

  " \ es, s:r,' said Parsons, imperturba-
bly making the entry.

  “A wonderful woman 1" mused Mr.
Mooney, with a kind of restrained
enthusiasm. “An adorable creature.' 1
could love her myself once I had the
handcuffs on her."

  It was an opinion about his future that.

627

had he known it, would probably have
rather amused Dale. For he, walking
slowly back to his room, was thinking
not at all of the princess, but of the
pleading eyes and the sad face memory
of which never left him.

  Deep in thought, he was standing on
the curb waiting a favorable moment
to cross the street, when from a han-
som that momentarily slackened its pace
as it passed there leaned forth a woman,
heavily veiled and muffled in a huge
cloak that covered her from head to
foot, and whispered:

  “Take care! Beware—oh, beware of
driving in a motor-car.”

  It was her voice.

  Dale, in his astonishment, gaped, fish-
like, and before he could speak the cab-
man lashed suddenly at his horse, and
in an instant the hansom was half-way
down the street, paying no attention to
the shouts of Dale, who was running
in pursuit.

  Another cabman near at hand saw a
chance of earning something substantial.

  “Jump in, guv’nor." he called, “and
I’ll catch 'em for you.”

  “Two pounds if you do,” cried Dale,
and made one spring into the cab, which
at once started at a hot pace, rocking
round corners and threading a practi-
cally abandoned course through the press
of the traffic.

*	Now a lumbering omnibus would de-
lay them, now a stretch of clear street
would give them an advantage, while
Dale, his hands nervously clutching on
the door-knob, ready to spring out, asked
himself whether he could have possibly
been mistaken in thinking he had rec-
ognized that soft, clear voice which had
uttered so strange a warning.

  To his dismay, a policeman lifted his
white-gloved hand to stop the traffic.
Now was the chance for the fugitives
to escape. But his driver whipped up
his horse and cut across, with a shouted
apology to the policeman to the effect
that he couldn’t “ ’old ’im in so quick.”
The first cab turned into a side-street,
where, half-way down the block, it
stopped. Its single occupant jumped
cut, wertt lightly up the steps of an un-
pretentious house, and in a second was
out of sight in the vestibule.

  Dale's own cab slackened speed, and,

not waiting for it to stop, he took a fly-
ing leap to the pavement, luckily kept
his feet, and while the passers-by gaped
at the sight of his haste, made after the
girl. He dashed into the entrance into
which she had gone, to find it empty.

  On the door was a small brass plate
that bore the words:

PRINCESS ANDRETTE FIANONA.

CHAPTER X.

PRINCESS FIANONA.

  A STRANGE tumult of fear and of
dismayed bewilderment arose in Dale’s
mind as he saw whither his pursuit had
led him. With a kind of sinister derision,
it seemed to him, the door-plate twinkled
up at him as if mockingly demanding
what reason he imagined had this girl
for flying from him, who loved her, to
take retuge with her deadliest enemy,
who was almost certainly responsible
for her strange and terrible arrival in
Scotland.

  Hampered with hesitation, he stood
there on the landing for four or five
minutes. At one moment he felt that
he must obtain entrance and discover
certainly who it was he had seen enter.
Then it seemed to him that this would
be foolish, that it might result in conse-
quences all the more dreadful to his
imagination from their very vagueness.

  He felt like a man oppressed by a
nightmare, struggling with an im-
palpable terror, or walking blindfold
among dreadful pits.

  Then the door opened quietly and
there glided out a little workman carry-
ing a small bag of tools.

  Dale glanced at him carelessly as he
moved aside to let him pass, but as the
man brushed by he whispered:

  “ I can do no good at all, you know,
sir, if you interfere and make her
suspicious.”

  "What! Mooney?" exclaimed Dale,
recognizing the sleepy little detective,
who certainly seemed to have shown no
sleepiness in his recent movements.

“That’s me, sir,” he said. “And it

doesn't help a man’s disguise to shout
out his name."

  “ Did you see that lady who just
entered the flat three or four minutes
ago?” asked Dale eagerly.

  “ Yes, sir, but we can’t talk here,"
replied Mooney. "Just follow me,
please.”

  Without another word he slipped off
down the stairs, and after a moment’s
vacillation Dale followed, reflecting that
in the end he could return to the flat, if
desirable, when he had heard what
Mooney knew. At any rate, the girl
could not be in any immediate danger,
since she seemed to be at perfect liberty.

  Accordingly, he went slowly in pursuit
of Mooney, who, after several blocks
were passed, dropped back and talked
with the young man.

  “ When you told me what little you
told me, sir," he remarked, “ I confess I
did not attach much importance to your
story. I have changed my mind now.”

  “ You saw that lady, then ? "

  “ Yes.” answered Mooney, shooting at
the other an odd and very alert look
from beneath his half-closed eyelids, “ I
saw her very plainly. I was working
in the vestibule when she entered.”

  “ That’s the one whom I want to
help," said Dale, atremble with excite-
ment. “ How can I see her and talk
with her? Shall I go to the house and
ask to see her, do you think? Or shall
I wait till she comes out again ? ”

  Mr. Mooney rubbed the end of his nose
very hard, and his air of weary dejection
was more pronounced than ever as he
sighed in response:

  “ That young lady who came in just
about five minutes before I came out in
a big cloak and a great hurry—do you
mean her, sir ? ”

  “ Yes, and I must speak to her.” Dale
jumped to his feet, his face flushed, his
voice trembling with eagerness. “ Did
you hear who she was?”

 “ Her name," answered Mooney
slowly, “ is Betty Brown, and she is the
Princess Fianona’s maid.”

  Dale stared at him blankly. Then
he shot out his arm across the table
and caught Mooney by the collar.

  “ Do you think this a time for
joking?” he demanded fiercely.

  “ I never joke," said Mr. Mooney in-

dignantly. “ Only fools joke, things
being what they are.”

  Dale relaxed his grasp upon the other's

collar, and then turned slowly toward
the door.

  “ I don’t understand,” he said briefly,
“ but I don't care to be played with. I
wish to have nothing more to do with
you. Mr. Mooney. I shall go straight
back to the flat and see for myself."

  “ Of all the hot-tempered young gen-
tlemen,” complained the detective,
" you’re the worst. How do you propose
to gain admittance to search a strange
lady’s flat?"

  The other hesitated, perceiving that
he had set himself no easy task. He
frowned and bit his lip. Mooney went
on in a slightly brisker tone:

  “ I pledge you my professional reputa-
tion that in the flat, at the moment I left
it, there was no other person but the
princess herself, Betty Brown, who had
just come in, and old Mrs. Brown,
Betty’s mother, cook and housekeeper to
the establishment and, as I believe, the
worst of the lot.”

  “ But I tell you I saw her go in there.
A man must believe his eyes.”

  "Not if he knows how often they
deceive him.” retorted Mooney. “ I
assure you. sir. I have examined every
room in that flat since I saw you. I knew
something was wrong with the electric
light, so I represented myself as a work-
man sent to see to it, and I went into
every room.

  “ It is only a small flat—two living-
rooms, two bedrooms, and the kitchen.
There is certainly not space to hide a
cat, let alone a young lady. But there
was one thing, sir, that has made me
decide to accept your commission, if you
still wish it, though T had fully made
up my mind to decline."

  "What is that?" asked Dale, whose
certitude was a little staggered by the
detective’s positive assurance that the flat
held but the three people he had men-
tioned.

  “ Why, this,” said Mooney. “ that
while I was there a gentleman named
Bellingham, from Exeter, came to see
the princess.

  “ He’s a doctor well known in the
west, 1 believe—an old man with a long
white beard, of which he seems very

proud. A bit ago his niece and ward
was drowned from one of the Irish boats.
I happened to be on board, and 1 saw
one or two things that struck me as—
rummy. And now when I find him
apparently on intimate terms with
Princess Fianona, I think that is—
rummy, too.

  “ They didn’t give me a chance to
learn much, but I heard Dr. Bellingham
say something was 1 terribly audacious,’
and ' risky,’ and the princess replied,
with that nasty little laugh of hers, that
she found it the most profoundly amusing
experience of her life.

  “ And I,” concluded Mooney, with a
tremendous sigh, “ would give a lot to
know what they referred to. For it
sounded ugly, Mr. Dale—it sounded
terribly ugly.”

  “ Then you'll take my commission to
watch this princess and report anything
suspicious or- unusual ? ” asked Dale.

  “ Yes, sir,” replied Mooney, “ but you
must understand I can’t promise good
results unless vou give me fuller informa-
tion.”

  " That’s impossible,” returned Dale;
“ at present, anyway. You’re simply to
keep her under observation, with a view
to discovering the identity and present
whereabouts of a young lady against
whom I believe this woman to be plot-
ting. But I can tell you nothing about
the young lady in question, except that
I saw her enter the flat just before you
came out.”

-	“ Which I know she didn’t, unless, of
course, she is identical with the princess,
whom I know well; with Betty Brown,
whose head sits so loose upon her
shoulders, or with Betty’s mother, wicked
old hag that she is. Moreover, if the
princess is plotting against the young
lady you speak of, how could it be
possible foT her to take refuge there ? ”
“ I must believe what I saw,” said
Dale obstinately.

  “ But what did you see? Probably
you just mistook Betty Brown for her.
Or perhaps the young lady wished to
avoid you and managed to dodge you.”
They talked a little more; then Dale
went away to dress for his dinner at the
“ Apollo ” with the mysterious princess.

  It was in a mood of some depression
that he made his preparations, for, certain

as he was that he had made no error—
the very suggestion seemed treachery to
his love—he felt the full baffling force
of the detective’s testimony. The more
he saw of the matter the blacker it
seemed.

  The “ Apollo ” was already full of
diners when he arrived, and on the
threshold he was met by Major Bennet,
a tall, dissipated-looking man with a
long, fair mustache and the reputation of
being able to live more extravagantly
on less money than any other man in
town.

  The major, though he had met him but
two or three times before, greeted him
with the warmth of an old friend, and
in a moment or two Dale found himself
bowing low as he was presented to the
Princess Fianona.

  He almost imagined there must be
some misunderstanding, so different was
she from all his expectations.

  In a vague way he had anticipated
some vision of resplendent and fascina-
ting beauty attired fittingly in an
exquisite dress and wearing magnificent
jewels. Instead, he saw a rather plain,
heavy-looking woman, obviously no
longer young, and making no attempt to
conceal the fact; on the whole, probably
the most dowdily dressed woman in the
room. And she was so eagerly intent
upon her dinner that she had hardly a
word to say.

  He experienced a vague sense of dis-
appointment, until the wonder of her
full, lustrous black eyes dawned upon
him. And as the meal progressed he
lost his sense of disappointment and
found himself taking far more than his
usual part in the conversation. It was
not that the princess herself spoke much
—she hardly said a word till she had
finished her soup, and afterward she
conversed chiefly in monosyllables.

  But somehow she seemed remarkably
sympathetic, showed an interest in her
companions, and in particular, displayed
so much knowledge of his own pictures
that Dale could not help responding. It
was not often in his life he had talked
so well, and once or twice when the
princess turned her full black eyes on
him with smiling approval of something
he had said he experienced a singular
feeling, as though his innermost thoughts
630

were being read—and read with admira-
tion.

  The thought crossed Dale's mind that
possibly there was some mistake about
the alleged criminality of the princess.
He wondered whether Sir George had
practised some deep treachery, and if
she were a victim herself of some obscure
plot.

  " Vou are looking at me very intently,
Mr. Dale," said the princess’s slow voice.
“ I wonder, now, if I dare ask you a
favor.”

  “ I should be delighted.”

  “ That’s what you men always say,”
answered the princess, looking at him
as though he were the only person in the
world for whose opinion she had any
regard; il yet some day. perhaps, I shall
ask you to paint my portrait. So you're
fairly warned.”

  “ I should be delighted again. I
should regard it as a great privilege.”
He repeated it earnestly, and it was
as though he heard some small voice
whispering in his ear that it was not only
a motor-car of which it was necessary
to beware.

  “ But how would you make me look. 1
wonder?” she asked, flashing at him a
very swift and piercing glance; “ for
they say, you know, you painters have
such terrible insight into character. Why,
I should be almost afraid.

  “ Vou must come to my flat and we’ll
discuss it. But not to-morrow, for I
intend to go motoring in the afternoon—
‘ :o mote,' as these fast, up-to-date people
say. Do you care for motoring. Mr.
Dale?”

   No.” he answered. “ comparatively
little. As a rule, I preserve an old-
fashioned love for horses. I've not been
in a motor-car for years.”

  “ Oh." she cried, clapping her hands
with more animation than she had shown
all through the dinner, “ then you must
certainly come with me to-morrow and
be converted, for mine is an electric car,
and so delightful. I shall expect you
at three: be sure vou do not fail. Mr.
Dale."

  Once more it seemed to him that he
stood upon the curb, while a low, sweet
voice whispered a strange warning, but
the princess’s black lustrous eyes were
upon him. and it almost seemed as though

they dragged from him by magnetic
force the affirmative he pronounced.

  “ So good of you." she murmured, and
smiled at him very pleasantly.

CHAPTER XL

IN SHITE OF WARNING.

  Ii was with strange thoughts that, at
the appointed hour that afternoon. Dale
stood waiting on the princess’s stairs.
He hoped that perhaps the unknown girl
herself would answer his ring, but in-
stead, a grim old woman appeared.

  She was very tall, and in spite of her
age, seemed still vigorous, though the
skin that covered her gaunt, hawk-like
features was as yellow as parchment.
The hooked nose and the projecting chin
almost met over the cruel thin lips, and
as he caught the glance of two pale, evil
eyes of a cold blue-gray it seemed to
him that he had either seen them before
or eyes very like them.

  " Mr. Dale?” she said, without wait-
ing for him to speak. “ My mistress is
expecting you, sir.”

  She paused and looked him up and
down, and then laughed wickedly to
herself.

  " Aye, aye," she muttered, with a
kind of senile malice, “ she is expecting
you. our little Andrette.”

  Mumbling something unintelligible,
she conducted him to a very pretty and
dainty little drawing-room, carried out
in an effective scheme of white and gold.

  " What an old beldame that woman
does look," thought Dale to himself
when she had gone. Instinctively he
took out a pocketbook and began, from
sheer force of habit, to sketch the old
woman’s face.

  “ Only I hope,” he muttered, as he
paused and surveyed his handiwork. " she
doesn't look quite such a fiend as n,v
sketch has turned her into, somehow."

  There was a light step just outside
the door, and then a faint, restrained
sound of scuffling, as if all those who
struggled were equally anxious to avoid
noise. It had a strange, sinister effect,
this soft conflict and subdued muttering
that reached him through the closed door
of the dainty little drawing-room, and
a moment he stood intently listening.
ENSHROUDED.

631

  Then something seemed to touch a fa-
miliar chord in his heart. He sprang
hastily toward the door. As he put out
his hand it opened suddenly, and the
princess, dressed for motoring, in a neat-
fittir.g jacket of moleskin and a heavy
white veil, came rustling in.

  " Isn't it too awful, Mr. Dale?" she
said, a slightly heightened color on her
cheeks. “ That intolerable maid of mine
has been drinking again.”

  Dale made no answer, but stared at
her stupidly: the vague memory that
had awakened in his mind died utterly
away.

  " 1 would send her off this instant.’’
continued the princess, “ but it would
break my dear old nurse's heart. And,
after all. it is not often Betty breaks out
like this."

  “ Betty,” repeated Dale, like a man
in a dream.

  “ That's her name." the princess ex-
plained—" Betty Brown: she is my old
nurse's daughter, and it is only for her
sake I keep Betty.”

  " It must certainly be trying,” said
Dale slowly.

  “ I am sorry for the deiay.” she re-
marked again. “ I don't want to be
overtaken by the dark.”

  Dale murmured something suitable as
he opened the door for her, and then
following her. had just closed it behind
him when he seemed to hear the faintest
echo of a cry of pain, poignant with in-
expressible agony, and yet so low, so in-
stantly suppressed, that he could not be
certain whether he had heard it at all.
and whence it had 'proceeded, or wheth-
er it had not been a trick of an excited
imagination.

  But already the princess was in the
street, where a smart-looking electric-
car was waiting for them, and though
reluctantly enough, he saw nothing for
it but to ran down after her. As he
assisted her to her seat she suddenly pro-
duced two letters from her capacious
muff.

  “ I had nearly forgotten them." she
said. “ Do you mind posting them for
me? "

  He walked across to the post-box near,
and in slipping them in noticed that the
uppermost one was addressed to Sir
George Bellville.

  At first, after he had taken his seat
by the princess, he had beer, surprised to
see that she intended to drive the car
herseh, but he soon perceived that she
was thoroughly competent. Proceeding
at a moderate pace, she kept her ma-
chine well under control, steered with
considerable dexterity, and showed a
good regard for the customs and courte-
sies of the road.

  The more Dale studied her the more
he recognized in her a woman of un-
usual mind and character. Common-
place in appearance, dowdy in dress,
there was ye: about her a curious mag-
netism to which no man could be entirely
indifferent, and to which Dale’s sensi-
tive artist nature responded readily.

  Her gift was not of the beauty of
which men tire, but of the mind that
is always fresh, and few ever escaped
from her fascination until she herself
threw them away.

  As it was. she had worked herself
through many disadvantages, from her
birthplace in a low Liverpool court,
where all the evils of life flourished, up
to her present position of apparent
wealth and rank, through a career where
the mile-stones were the ruined .souls
of the men on whom she had smiled as
now she smiled on Arthur Dale.

  “ Mr. Dale,” she said suddenly, “ I
wonder if you know how handsome you
are? Men are sometimes rather ashamed
of their good looks; I hope you aren't.”
“ I don't think so,” he laughed, find-
ing her abrupt frankness rather piquant.
“ Are you not afraid of making me
vain ? ”

  “ Now. 1 see, you are angry- with
me.” she remarked, with a quaint
grimace; “ but do not forget I’m old
enough to be your mother.”

  " Hardly. 1 fancy,” said he. laugh-
ing again, “ seeing I am twenty-five.”

  “ And I-” she answered. “ It is

a profound secret. You will not be-
tray it. will you? But I am five years
older in age and two centuries in ex-
perience."

  “ Oh, well, if you are over two hun-
dred years old I am prepared to admit
you might have been my mother.”

  The orincess, after that, did most of
the- talking, speaking freely and ir.ti-
matelv. There was, somehow, a warmer
THE ALL STORY MAGAZINE.

tone in her conversation, and it surprised
Dale to see how friendly they seemed
to have become. On one occasion she
made a half-sad, half-bitter reference to
her past life that impressed the young
man with a sense of sympathy toward
one who had suffered.

  From what she said, it seemed she
had been married young to Prince Fia-
nona—which appeared to be an Ital-
ian title — and Dale gathered that
though the prince had been fond of her,
he had been a man of vulgar habits and
of an absolute hatred toward artistic
interests, which naturally filled so large
a part of her life.

  “ Shortly before he died,” she re-
marked, “ the poor fellow made me
promise never either to paint or to sketch
again. He seemed to be possessed by a
morbid hatred of the arts.”

  “ But surely-” exclaimed Dale.

  “ Ah.” she interrupted, “ one must
keep one’s word; that's necessary, if one
is to steer straight through this tangled
world. Especially a promise to the
dead."

  What could Dale do but how before
so high a display of principle?

  Almost certain was he now that Bel-
ville bad attempted to inveigle him into
a plot against a perfectly innocent, wom-
an of the highest character.

   He grew quite indignant, and in his an-
gry thoughts there was, for the time,
small room for memories of certain soft
brown eyes, however sweet and plead-
ing, or of a certain gentle, sad face.

  They grew even more intimate when
they began to discuss the portrait of the
princess that Dale was to paint soon,
and then quite suddenly she brought the
car to a full stop.

  “What’s the matter?” he asked, for
into her eyes had come a sudden fear, as
though she perceived some danger from
which they bad but barely escaped.

   “ I was thinking,” she replied, “ that
we’d better turn here and go back.”

  They were in a deep and narrow lane,
in one of those solitary patches of coun-
try still to be found near London. To
turn here would be awkward, even dan-
gerous, for a deep ditch ran by the side
of the road.

   Dale looked at her in surprise.

  “ It’s an awkward spot for turning,

isn’t it? Hadn't we better run through
that grove of trees in 'front? We’ll prob-
ably find an easier place to turn farther
on.'’

  She agreed with him, and started the
car slowly forward.

  Suddenly he was aware that she was
looking at him curiously, though the mo-
ment she realized that he had perceived
she turned hastily.

  “ I didn't make you angry just now,
did I,” she asked softly, “ when I said
you were so handsome? ”

  “ Certainly not.” he answered; “ why
should you think you had?”

  “ I like the lad,” she murmured, her
hands moving restlessly on the steering-
wheel. “ Besides, he would add just
the supreme relish to the whole affair—
pay the child out beautifully, and give
the Lamb a lesson.”

  Then she seemed to remember that
she was muttering aloud and broke off,
frowning.

    A foolish trick of mine,” she said,
with a forced laugh. “ I learned it
during three of the most monotonous and
tedious years of my life that I spent once
in France. I think we can turn here.”
She seemed in hesitation as she slack-
ened the speed, and her rather heavy
features showed a perplexity, even an
alarm, quite unwarrantable.

  “ But if you just pass that grove,”
said he again, “ turning will be easy
and safe.”

  Again ’she started the car, and this
time it bounded forward rapidly—faster,
in fact, than it had theretofore traveled.

  There was a curious set look on her
face, as if the pace made her nervous.
He leaned forward to suggest that she
should moderate it, and at the same mo-
ment it was as if the car hounded in the
air. Dale found himself flying through
space to crash headforemost into a small
bush and to the green turf beyond. He
lay quite still, at first, conscious onlv
of a pain in his left arm.

  With an effort, remembering that the
princess might also be hurt and in need
of help, he dragged himself to a crouch-
ing position. He vaguely saw two men. a
few yards farther on, rise from behind
the shrubbery on the roadside, and with
bludgeons in their hands come running
toward him.

  Faintly lie recognized in the first of
them Wilkes, and in the second that
thin red-whiskered man whom he had
seen running in blind panic through the
mist on that night of battle.

  Between them and him ran the prin-
cess. with arms uplifted, though whether
in encouragement, in defiance, or in
greeting he could not tell.

 He tried to get to his feet, and with
 the motion a terrible pain shot through
 his body.

 A tumult of shouting and wild oaths
 reached his deafened ears.

 Before his fleeting sight floated a cloud
 of pale, angry faces and brandished
 weapons.

 Then he fainted.

MRS. PICKETT'S TEMPTATION.

                  By John Ba'rton Oxfoi'd.

  HERE IN a connivance with
  the criminal turns out to be
  an assistance to the virtuous, o*

IT was a gentle tapping that sounded
at the back door—so gentle, indeed,
that it seemed almost apologctic; yet
at the sound of it Mrs. Pickett started
nervously in her chair, and her hands,
which were holding a piece of yellowed
paper close to the feeble light of the
lamp, began to tremble.

  Nevertheless, she arose, and making
her way across the creaking floor of the
tiny kitchen, answered the summons.

  On the door-step stood a disheveled
young man, his clothes covered with dust
and torn by the underbrush of the
woods; his shoulders drooped with weari-
ness, and a two days’ growth of stubbly
beard covered his face. She noticed, with
a little gasp of surprise, a small, well-
defined scar on the left cheek.

  The instant the door had opened the
stranger had removed his battered felt
hat, and now he lifted to Mrs. Pickett's
face a pair of very tired blue eyes.

  “ Good evening,” he said in a low
voice, which also had something of apol-
ogy in it. “ I hope I haven’t startled
you. Can you get me something to eat?
I’m willing to pay you for it," he added,
in smiling explanation.

  She looked at him doubtfully for a

moment. Her heart was pounding madly,
and she felt her knees weakening beneath
her. A second glance, however, gave
her courage. He was not a large man,
and, moreover, he was very plainly tired
out; his face, too, had an expression of
almost childish frankness.

  Mrs. Pickett swallowed what few of
her misgivings remained and stepped
back from the door.

  “ Come in,” she said, holding it open
for him to enter. “ I guess maybe I
can accommodate you.”

  The young man shuffled into the little
kitchen, and sank into a chair against
the wall with a sigh of relief. In the
fuller light of the room his appearance
was even less disquieting than it had
been on the door-step.

  Despite the fact that he was covered
with dust and haggard and unshaven,
there was something rather attractive
about his face. The last of Mrs. Pick-
ett’s apprehensions vanished as she began
to bustle about preparing the meal. The
stranger sat very quietly in his chair,
his head tilted back against the wall, anil
his eyes closed. Presently his hat slipped
from his hand to the floor, and Mrs.
Pickett, looking up from the place she
was setting at the table, saw he was
asleep.

  A grim light came into her eyes. She
tiptoed cautiously to the sleeper’s side
and stood looking down at him.

  “ Guess I didn’t have no call to
be scared of him,” she muttered half
aloud. “ That is. if it really is him,"

she added.

  She moved noiselessly to the dork, on
the mantel-shelf, and from beneath it
drew a paper—a copy of a circular she
had seen at the post-office two days be-
fore. She had copied the circular, that
she might recognize this man and avoid
him; that she might lock herself in the
house in case he appeared in the vicinity.

  That she would ever assume the of-
fensive. in the event of meeting him. had
been the farthest thing from her mind;
now that he was here, such a course
seemed absurdly easy—he was so frail-
looking and so altogether worn out. She
unfolded the paper and ran her eyes
over the description it contained, fitting
it bit by bit to the sleeping man before
her.

  " ‘ Five feet seven and a half,’” she
read. " That part's all right. ‘ Weight,
one hundred and forty-six pounds.’
Looks most too pindling for that, but
maybe he does. ' Blond hair and blue
eyes.' That fits to a T. ' Sandy com-
plexion.’ Vou can’t tell nothing about
that, he's so sunburnt, but it might be
sandy ju*t as well as not. ‘ Small scar
on left cheek.’ If I had any doubts, I
gUess that would settle ’em. I guess
it’s him. all right, and I guess I might
just as well have the reward as anybody
else. There ain’t nobody who needs it
any worse’n I do, that’s one thing cer-
tain.”

  She dropped the paper into the fire
and then put the supper she had pre-
pared onto the table, after which she
shook the sleeping man into wakeful-
ness.

   11	Your supper’s ready now,” she said,
as he sat up staring about him stupidly.

He rubbed his eyes, and for a moment
seemed trying to collect his scattered

senses.

  “ Supper ? Ah, yes. Thank you.” he
said, at length. He drew a chair to the
table and began eating hungrily, like a
man half famished.

  Mrs. Pickett sat watching him nar-
rowly. She was perfectly cool; there
v as not a trace of agitation about her.
Very deliberately she planned it out in
her mind. She would offer to get him
'-■'me fresh water: then, as soon as this
ruse had got her clear of the house, she

would go to the wood-shed and load the
double-barreled gun.

  As soon as he had finished his supper
she would order him lo the front room
and mount guard over him until such
time in the early morning as she could
summon aid from the workmen on their
way to the quarry.

  No sooner had the plan formulated
itself in her mind than she proceeded to
act upon it. She got hurriedly to her
feet and lifted the water-bucket from
its shelf by the sink.

  “ Maybe you’d like some fresh wa-
ter? ” she hazarded.

  “ Don’t bother,” said the man between
mouthfuls. “ I’ll get it myseli* if I
want any.”

  “ I’d just as soon,” she said, and
slipped out of the house.

  Once outside, she set the bucket on
the ground, softly opened the door of
the wood-shed, and cautiously felt her
way through the darkness of the place
to the corner where the old shotgun rest-
ed in the angle of the walls. Fumbling
about on the shelf above her head, she
found the box of shells, snapped the
breech open, and thrust one into either
barrel. Then she made her way out of
the wood-shed and stood panting in the
back yard.

  Through the kitchen-window she could
see her unsuspicious guest still eating
hungrily at the table. A sudden wave of
compunction seized her. Her knees be-
gan to tremble, but by sheer force of
will she stilled the tumult of her mind.

  “He ain’t nothin’ to me," she told
herself angrily. “ I hadn’t ought to
have no fool qualms about sendin’ him
back. If I don’t do it, some one cer-
tainly will, an’ I need that money—
Lord knows how I need it.”

  She crossed the yard, to stop irresolute-
ly again at the back door. Three times
she essayed to lift the latch, but each
time her arm fell back to her side with
the simple deed still unaccomplished.

  The man had finished his meal and
was pushing back his chair. Mrs. Pick-
ett took up the gun. and with a heart
pounding violently against her ribs,
opened the door and entered the kitchen,
'llie man’s eyes widened in surprise.
They fixed themselves finally on the
ru>tv shotgun in Mrs. Pickett’s" hands.
MRS. PICKETT’S TEMPTATION.

  “ It’s loaded,” she said, very grimly.

  The young man smiled in deprecating
fashion.

  “ I'm mighty sorry I’ve frightened
you,” he said gravely, his eyes still on
the gun.

  “ You ain't scared me none,” Mrs.
Pickett returned. Then very deliberate-
ly she cocked the gun and raised it to
her shoulder. “ You’d better be goin’
now.” she commanded.

  The young man seemed not in the
least perturbed. He looked quite stead-
ily into the barrels of the gun and then
at the woman.

  “ I guess you’ve made some sort of a
mistake,” he began.

  “ I ain’t made no mistake,” Mrs.
Pickett returned. “ You'd better go, an’
go quick, before I change my mind
again. I know who you are. You're
Dave Samson. You got out of the peni-
tentiary at Danville day before yester-
day. They’re huntin’ for you all around
these parts now, an’ there’s a cirkeler
down to the post-office givin’ a descrip-
tion of you an’ offerin’ a reward of a
hundred dollars for your capture. I
know’d you soon’s I clapped my eyes on

ter go.”

  Her guest stood before her, smiling
quietly. He made no motion to leave.
Instead, he put his hand into his pocket
and drew out a handful of silver and be-
gan picking out some coins.

  “ How much is my supper? ” he asked
calmly.

  “ I don't want your money,” said Mrs.
Pickett. “ You keep it. Like enough
you'll have need of it before you get
away from ’em. Now you'd better start
right off. You're temptin' of me every
minute that you’re staying here. I need
money very much. There’s a mortgage
on this house, an’ the interest is long
overdue.

  “ They're goin’ to foreclose on me if
I can’t raise fifty dollars before next
Wednesday. When you come here to-
night I was figgerin’ it up an’ prayin'
that I might get that fifty in some way.
but I ain’t a goin’ to get it in no such
way as this. I ain’t goin’ to send you
back to Danville for the sake of havin’
it. Now, you go, d’ yer hear? You go

  The young man looked at her thought-
fully for a moment. Then he picked
up his battered hat and opened the back
door. On the threshold he turned.
Mrs. Pickett, with the gun still held to
her shoulder, was watching him with
steady eyfes.

  “ I’m much obliged to you. I sha’n't
forget it,” he said quietly, and disap-
peared into the darkness.

  She heard his dragging footsteps cross-
ing the yard. Suddenly she put down
the gun and ran to the back door.

  “ Say; you,” she called.

  “ Yes,” came a voice out of the dark-
ness; “ what is it? ”

  “ Vou'd oughter be careful about goin’
to houses,” she cautioned. “ An’ if you
was to take some of the outside shells
of shagbarks an’ grind ’em up between
your hands an' rub ’em on your hair
’twould darken it up considerable."

  “ Thanks,” the voice returned simply.
She heard him crashing through the
underbrush at the edge of the woods.
She listened intently until the sounds
grew fainter and finally died away.
Then she sank down on the door-step and
wept weakly.

  Two days later, .sirs. Pickett opened
a letter addressed to her, at the post-
office, and stood staring stupidly at a
fifty-dollar bill pinned to the bit of scrib-
bled paper within. It was some time be-
fore she could collect herself sufficiently
to read the brief note written in a sprawl-
ing hand.

SYNOPSIS O'F PREVIOUS CHAPTERS.

BEATRIX YBARRA, cousin of President Ybarra, of the South American republic San
Benito, loves Colonel Arniytage, a British officer, but Ybarra, who wishes to marry
her for money, abducts her from New York by means of his tool. Gonzalez. Through a
chain of circumstances she is accompanied by Fifi Sariol and Cornelius Kerrigan. Army-
tnge gets up an expedition to rescuc Beatriz, and enrolls Allardyce and Corbyn, who start
for San Benito on a ship carrying, unbeknown to lliem, anus for San Benitan revolution-
ists, and on which an unexplained mutiny occurs, wherein the young men have a taste of
fighting. Ybarra learns of the cargo of this ship, and when it arrives at La Boat, the San
Benitan seaport, just after Beatriz is brought there, decides to destroy it with torpedoes.

   This he succeeds in doing. Allardyce and Corbin escape destruction by diving just
before the shock, and are rescued from the water by Challoner, a New York newspaper
correspondent and a friend of Arniytage, who has been warned that the two young men
from .Manhattan will turn up on the Hilario. Challoner, consequently, feeds them, gives
them dry c|othes, and sets them on the road to La Boca, where they pass the president and
his kidnaped fiancee, and Kerrigan and Fifi—bound, by carriage, to Cruz Alta, the country's
capital—and are " spotted " by Gonzalez. In some fear they go to the Golden Eagle, a
hostelry whose landlady is devoted to Armytage, but in the night are captured by lancers,
sc-nt after them by Gonzalez, and taken to the city prison. Meanwhile, Ybarra and his party
have decided to go still farther into the interior, to a place known as the Golden Horseshoe.
Challoner learns of this and informs Armytage. who lias at last arrived safely in San
Benito, and the latter, with his little troop, picked to accomplish the rescue of Beatriz,
sets out and lir.st liberates Allardyce and Corbyn, and then proceeds, with colossal nerve,
to travel through Cruz Alta and after the fleeing president.

TH E city of the golden spires was
sparkling in the morning sun-
shine when two dusty Iraveling-
carriages drew up before the
great pink-marble palace which looks
loftily across the Plaza Principale.

  Cornelius Kerrigan helped Fi.fi from
the first of these, and Karl von Rudolf
stood bowing by the other while the pres-
ident alighted.

  Beatriz came forth also, but without
availing herself of the hand extended
by her august relative.

   They all went up the steps together,
and the guard presented arms, while such
of the populace as were astir and pass-
ing through the square peered in upon
them from behind the gilded railings,
gaping at the spectacle, but giving no
sign or sound of approval. For the
Tiger’s yoke pressed full heavily upon
the common people. But as they reached
the pillared portico and there came run-
ning forth to greet them one who had
been watching from within a cry of
" Viva Sariol! ” resounded from the
background, and Ybarra bit his lips.

   The black frown faded from his face,
however, as he shook hands warmly with
the effusive newcomer, and turning to
his cousin, he said ceremoniously:

     I have the honor to present to you
Don Quintin Sariol, vice-president of
the republic and my most valued friend.”

  “ I kiss your hands. I am your hum-
ble servant,” declared Sariol, with
breathless volubility. “ But have you
heard. Ybarra, that the Englishman is
hard at your heels? Pray pardon my ab-
ruptness. sefwrita. but we live in
troublous times, and it is for his excel-
lency's welfare."

  “ What is the latest from La Boca?”
asked the president, cutting him short.
“ Has any message reached you from
the Pass?”

  “ The wires are down,” said Sariol,
without attempting to suppress the mal-
ice in his voice. " There will be no
more messages in the meantime, I'm
afraid.”

  Ygnacio Ybarra glared at him. but
made no other comment on the news.

  “ Order fresh horses, Von Rudolf," he
Snapped over his shoulder.

  The general coolly transmitted the
order to an adjacent sentry in a tone of
indifferent contempt. He was 110 lackey,
and though it pleased him for the pres-
ent to ride at the head of the presiden-
tial life-guards, he was ready and will-
ing to show this South American savage
that it was Karl von Rudolf, and not
a menial, who wore his livery.

  Nor was his excellency slow to realize
that he had made a false step.

  “ I wish you’d take my cousin in to
breakfast. KarL” he said, in a concilia-
tory tone. “ I’ve business to discuss with
Quintin, here. Show those two. also,
where to find food, if you will.''

  Fifi and Kerrigan followed without a
word as Beatriz moved forward on Von
Rudolf’s arm, and after she had been be-
stowed within the president's private
apartment they were shown into an ad-
joining room, wherein was spread a re-
past, at the sight of which Cornelius
whistled mellifluously:

  “ No more chop-sooy and cheap rapid-
fire meals for mine. It suits me better
to inhabit a pink palace."

  Von Rudolf shot a swift inquiring
glance at Fifi and withdrew.

  Ybarra did not waste much time over
affairs of state with the vice-president.
He rejoined Beatriz within ten minutes,
and having seen that all her wants were
supplied, dismissed the servants, helping
himself from the buffet before lie sat
down beside her.

  “ Listen, my cousin," he said sharply,
and she looked up at him in obvious as-
tonishment. “ There is no time for fur-
ther trifling, and we must understand
each other clearly. The crisis approaches
fast. 1 have not weeks to woo you in.
I have no option but to act. You know
that I intend to marry you; and that our

union will save San Benito from-”

  She interrupted him with flashing
eyes.

  “ Peace, man! ” she cried, “ and do
not perjure your unfortunate country.

  “ You know that I will never marry
you. Not even in order to fill your
empty purse. You know that if you are
forced from your dictatorship to-mor-
row San Benito will be better off than
it is to-day.

  “ You know that my troth is pledged
elsewhere; and let me tell you, since
there is no time for further trifling, that

I	hold my least pledge sacreji Would
you could say as much! ”

  His face grew livid as she thus defied
him, for heretofore their intercourse had
been more guarded, and he had never
doubted that in time he would be able
to achieve his object. Her allegiance
to his rival, set forth thus in words for
the first time, was in itself sufficient to
provoke him to the point of frenzy.

  •Who was this English dog that would
dare to beard the Tiger of San Benito?

  " Cuerpo de Dios'” swore the presi-
dent. “ I'll free you from your troth,
fair cousin, and no least pledge will bind
you to a lifeless body. Without, there!
Chamberlain! Tell Father Agust in he
is to travel with us. We leave for the
Golden Horseshoe within five minutes.
Let the people know that I shall bring
back a wife—the Dona Beatriz Ybarra.”
The official, who had come at his call,
went hastily to carry out his orders.
When the travelers set forth again there
was a priest in their company.

  All the church-bells were ringing
wildly. At the street-corners there win-
cheering crowds. His excellency's wa-
ning popularity had apparently received
a fillip, and that in the nick of time.

  But Quintin Sariol, standing on the
palace-steps, whence he had sped the
couple whose announced engagement
had so pleased the fickle populace,
laughed with low glee.
638

THE ALL-STORY MAGAZINE.

  "The fool!” he said, speaking thus
disrespectfully of his superior. “ The
stupid fool—to think that such a woman
would defy him with mere words!”

  A long day's journey took the tired
travelers into the far recesses of that great
sirrra whose volcanic peaks look down
on five republics. Von Rudolf, faith-
ful to his task, went with them all the
way, and it was well he did, since within
a wild ravine they were beset by a strong
body of insurgent infantry, wild moun-
taineers of no mean marksmanship, who
under efficient leadership might have put
period to this history there and then.

  But after a fierce contest they were
driven from their coigns of vantage with
only the death of a dozen government
troopers to their credit. The pass was
picketed, fresh horses were harnessed in
the place of those which had fallen un-
der fire, the two women came forth from
among the rocks, where they had been
led to shelter, and they reached safety
without further accident.

  The Golden Horseshoe, so called
from its shape, was an enormous cup-
like hollow, scooped by some eternal
power out of the sheer cliff-face which
spread for leagues on either side of it
and towered mistily above. Its only
opening looked across the intervening
hilltops, toward Cruz Alta, and was
guarded by a ridge of rock through
which a narrow entrance had been
blasted by the hand of man.

  Within lay an almost circular expanse
of level pasture, watered by a stream
which showed like a white thread against
the golden rock five hundred feet above.
Sheer in the center there rose from the
green plain a steep, unscalable islet of
stone, an altar to the gods, pushed up
entire out of the solid earth. Upon this
stood a number of low white buildings.

  With a sufficient garrison at the open-
ing of the Horseshoe, the place was abso-
lutely impregnable, and it was Ybarra’s
property. He had been born there, on
liis father's hacicntla, and still farmed
the fertile acres which encircled his old
home.

  “ Is this the local Sing-Sing?’ asked
Kerrigan, staring about him in blank
amazement. “ It won’t be easy to break
out, at any rate. Did you ever see such
a place, Fifi ? ”

  " It’s very wonderful,” the girl an-
swered gently, her eyes on the golden
glow cast by the setting sun upon the
stupendous walls about her.

  Their carriage stopped under the
fortress-like shadow of the central height
and they alighted. Ybarra and his
cousin took the lead, and all slowly des-
cended a steep winding staircase cut in
the solid rock.

  It was a long climb to the top, but
once there they could not restrain the
exclamations of surprise that rose to
their lips as the full beauty of the scene
displayed itself.

  Even Ybarra was touched for an in-
stant as he looked back toward the city
of the golden spires all glittering in the
tender sunset beyond the blue hills in
between.

 11	You will be happy here, my
Beatrix? ” he whispered. She turned
from him with a faint gesture of con-
tempt.

  “ Not with you,” she answered stead-
ily.

  Her hand was on her heart, against
which nestled a fragrant faded rose.

  Cornelius had not failed to notice that
the stair was well guarded: he saw the
twinkling camp-fires on the inside of the
ridge that encompassed the Golden
Horseshoe, but noticed that in addition
to the sentry at the top of the steps,
there seemed to be no armed men on the
plateau.

  “ It’s safe enough without them,” he
mumbled disconsolately. “ No visitors
without wings will trouble us here. I’d
hate to go too near the edge on a dark
night.”

  There were wide, unkempt gardens
about the white buildings, and beyond
those a thicket of low trees which shel-
tered them from any sudden blast.

  “ Two acres and a cow—on the top
of a perch ! ’’ Kerrigan remarked to Fifi,
and showed her the quadruped in ques-
tion—a draft-ox at the windlass of a
well.

  Once within the walls, however, they
forgot the strangeness of their situation
in the midst of solid comfort. Ill kept
as the surroundings seemed to be. there
was no detail missing in the interior of
the rambling dwelling.

  Servants were waiting to receive
CLIPPING THE TIGERS CLAWS.

them; all were treated with considera-
tion. The women were taken charge of
by two maids, the president had two
men to attend him. and Cornelius one.
The priest seemed to have betaken him-
self elsewhere for the time being.

  But he appeared again at dinner-time,
and ate below the salt with the two
others, while Beatriz sat with her cousin
at a separate table.

  It was a silent meal, and every one
was glad when it was over. Ere they
separated for the night, however,
Ybarra took the opportunity to explain
his plans and dispositions.

  “ Y'ou know the rules, Dom Agustin,”
he said, turning his chair to face the
other table; “you. Mr. Kerrigan, may
learn from the holy father. My poor
house, here, with all that it contains, is
at your disposal, so long as you do not
transgress my rules.

  “ I have come hither to attend a wed-
ding—my own with Dona Beatriz Y'bar-
ra. It will take place within our private
chapel to-morrow night, at this hour.
Dom Agustin will marry us, and you two
will attend as witnesses.

  “ Ladies and gentlemen. I give you the
good night.’'

  He arose, and left them sitting,
dumbly conscious of their helplessness
in his hands. Presently the women went
also, weary enough to forget their
troubles in sleep.

  Kerrigan was fatigued almost beyond
endurance, but he sat on for an hour
and sucked a very sound cigar that the
priest had produced, hoping to extract
therefrom some temporal comfort.

  Ybarra seemed to have forgotten that
neither could understand the other, and
the rules of which he had spoken could
not, therefore, be imparted to the
stranger wjthin his gates. Father Agus-
t!n knew no English, Kerrigan little
Spanish. They compounded on such
few words of Latin as the actor still
carried in his memory, and having ex-
hausted these, parted with mutual com-
passion, very little the wiser for their
intercourse.

  It was late next morning before Cor-
nelius awoke, and having breakfasted, at
the instigation of his servant, in his own
apartment, he went out into the garden
to smoke.

   Fifi and Beatriz were there before him,
pacing an open path together, chatting
in low tones, with ever and anon an
anxious glance in the direction of Cruz
Alta.

  “ You haven’t a revolver, have you,
Mr. Kerrigan?'' Fifi asked as he ap-
proached.

  “ I have that/’ he answered cheer-
fully. “But why?"

  " Would you—will you let me have it
this evening?" Beatriz begged impul-
sively, but he shook his head.

  “ Excuse me, Miss Ybarra.” he re-
plied, “ but—if there’s any shooting to
be done, I'll do it myself. Now, don't
mistake my meaning. I'm going to be
best man at this interesting ceremony to-
night, and it will be my painful duty to
show cause why the ceremony should be
stopped by the simple but effective
method of corpsing the chief performer.

  “If you see me stoop to tie my shoe-
lace, stand fast—and don't scream.”

  She shuddered in the sunshine.

  “ There you are, you see," he added.
“ You’d be far too nervous.’’

  “ I meant it for myself—not him,"
she whispered. “ That would be the
easier way.”

  He shook his head decidedly.

“ I’m going to be best man,” he re-
peated. “ Leave all the details to me.”
A flash as of lightning flared up from
above Cruz Alta, and was followed by
others in steady succession.

  “What’s that?” Fifi asked curiously.
“ It's been going on all morning.”

  “ Somebody jiggling a shaving-mir-
ror in the sun,” Cornelius answered from
the depths of his superior knowledge.
“ Perhaps they’re trying to signal.
That's it, sure. A heliograph, of
course. They’re talking to us here. I
only wish I could read it.”

  “ Beatriz! ” cried a voice from the
veranda behind, and turning, they saw
the president.

  “ Our good friend Quintin Sariol
sends his respects and asks me if lie
may attend our wedding. Shall I say
yes?”

   “ Say yes,” Cornelius whispered to her
from behind, and on the impulse of the
moment. She nodded, and his excel-
lency looked well pleased.

  “ I'm glad you’re agreeable.” he re-

marked, and went back again to where,
at oue side of the house, a field telegraph-
ist was receiving and answering the
distant signals.

  The day passed somewhat drearily
despite strong efforts on the part of all
to show at least an outward unconcern.
The two girls dreaded, in anticipation,
the seemingly inevitable tragedy that
every hour was bringing nearer. Ker-
rigan was cudgeling his brains for some
faint semblance of a plan to prevent the
atrocious wrong Ybarra was ready to per-
petrate.

  He knew too well that it would be
but by a miracle that he could hope to
carry out his wild idea of shooting the
wrongdoer down on the steps of the
altar. His excellency was by far too
clever, too well accustomed to such meth-
ods. to afford him any opportunity of
using the ineffectual weapon he had
strapped to his ankle. (He had done this
with the idea that he might be searched.)
Come what might, he could not let the
victim of the wrong take her own life.

  “ I’d throw myself off this cliff if it
would help her,” he reflected wretchedly.
“ But, as things are. that would be worse
than a useless sacrifice. We’ll have to
wait and see what happens.”

  The dinner-hour came round relent-
lessly. and with it Father Agustin ap-
peared again. The five of them sat
mutely through it. and after coffee had
been served Ybarra rose.

  “ Come, cousin,” he said coldly.

  She followed him without a word.

  The priest went next, and after him
walked Kerrigan, with Fifi leaning heav-
ily on his arm.

  “ You mustn't faint,” he said to her
in an anxious whisper as they passed
through a long passage. “ Be brave—
•for just a little while longer.”

  She shook convulsively, but soon her
steps grew steadier, and he was able to
spare a morsel of mental advice to his
own raw nerves.

  “ Keep cool, you shivering snipe! " he
said savagely to himself, “ and, when the
time comes, act like a man.”

They went downward into the earth,
by steps that were slippery with damp
and gray with mildew, toward soft mu-
tiiat came as if from behind closed
doors.

  “ A merry sort of marriage—in a
catacomb! ” commented Kerrigan in-
wardly. “ liut all the more convenient
for a funeral.”

  A double door in front moved noise-
lessly back upon its hinges; a blaze of
light burst through. Kerrigan crossed
the threshold of the church behind the
priest, and stared about him blindly for
a moment as he moved toward the altar.

   It was indeed a most surprising scene
that met his view.

   A cave in the interior of the table-
land on which the hacicnda buildings
stood had been converted, in the course
of many lifetimes, into a chapel, perfect
in every detail, from the most intricate
carving of the massive pillars to the
grained arches of the natural roof. The
loving labor of centuries had gone to
make the cave a casket worthy of its
purpose.

  It was a masterpiece—a monument to
-the dead men who had perfected it.

   The crash of a great organ echoed in
the vault above, and many voices were
uplifted in a curious chant. The edi-
fice was full to overflowing, and the ef-
fect was almost deafening.

   Ybarra stopped before the altar, and
his cousin faced him as the priest passed
up the steps. Fifi would have gone for-
ward, but he held up his hand, and from
the ranks of men in uniform on either
side four stepped forward.

  Two tackled Kerrigan, and in such
wise that he had little chance to strug-
gle. The other two took each a hand
of Fifi’s, holding her gently where she
was.

  The whole affair had been stage-
managed to a_jirto. and Beatriz Ybar-
ra. looking wildly about her, saw all
chance of escape cut off.

  The singing ceased and at that in-
stant there came thrusting up the aisle
Don Quintin Sariol, in boots and spurs,
and breathless from his journev.

   In his great haste he had forgotten to
doff his hat. and when he did so it was
too late to stay him in his purpose.

  “ Let no man move a finger, or I
fire! ” he cried. And no man did move.

   For he had the prospective bridegroom
by the throat at arm's length, and with
his head bent back upon the altar. In
his right hand he held a cocked revolver,
CLIPPING THE TIGER’S CLAWS.

with the muzzle making a white mark on
the prospective bridegroom's forehead.

  For a tense moment- this endured.
Then Ybarra spoke, quite calmly.

   “ You're earlier than I expected, Ar- ■
mytage,” he said. “ I wish you wouldn’t
press so hard upon .your pistol.”

CHAPTER X.

DON QUINTIN SARIOI. SHOWS CURIOSITY,
    AND SUFFERS THE CONSEQUENCES
    WITHOUT COMPLAINT, WHILE JOA-
    QUIN GONZALEZ SHOWS THE WHITE
    FEATHER.

   It had struck Quintin Sariol as high-
ly humorous that his superior in the
executive of San Benito should have as-
sumed the task of bending Beatriz
Ybarra’s will to his.

  “ The wedding ceremony will be en-
tertaining—to the spectators,” the vice-
president told himself, and grinned
across the table at his secretary.

  “ Make me a cipher message to his
excellency,” he commanded. “ Say that
■affairs of state will take me to the Gold-
en Horseshoe on the instant, and that
I hope to reach his side in time to at-
tend his nuptials.

  “ Afterward, order horses—three re-
lays.”

  “And any escort?” asked the man of
letters.

   “ I’ll take two orderlies. Von Rudolf
and his men have doubtless left the road
safe, and—I'm not afraid.”

   He left the room to change his clothes
for the journey, and his underling
glanced after him through gold-rimmed
glasses.

   “ You're a deep well, Don Quintin,”
said that worthy to himself, “ and if
you meet a few Reds by the way it will
not inconvenience you. I only wish I
knew which of you is coming out on top.”

  There was an answer to the message
waiting when Sariol came in again.

   “ At half past nine to-night,” it said,
and that was all.

   “ I’ll start at once, and dine with them
at eight. It will be amusing to watch
them together,” he reflected mischiev-
ously, and so set forth.

He made good speed upon the jour-
ney. finding fresh horses ready for him

at each stage, and sunset saw him at the
entrance of the gorge wherein the presi-
dent had been attacked the day before.

  “ We’ll wait on this side until dark
comes down,” lie told his scanty escort.
“ It will be safer then than in the half-
light.”

  He threw his reins to one of the two
troopers and sauntered along the road-
side, smoking contentedly, as they
ensconced themselves behind a boulder
to avoid unfriendly observation.

  A hundred yards away he, too, sat
down and looked about him curiously.

  Suddenly his attention became concen-
trated on a split tree-trunk not a stone’s
throw from where he was sitting, he saw
clearly a brown gun-barrel resting upon
the fork, and behind it two white eye-
balls that were fixed steadily on the top
left-hand pocket of his waistcoat.

  He did not stir, nor yet cry out, be-
cause he had already recalled to mind
the unfortunate fact that a warm wind
was blowing from behind him, where-
fore his voice might not carry far in
that direction.

 He did not move when he heard
stealthy footsteps on the splintered shale
among the undergrowth at one side.

  When a sharp voice said “ Hands
up! ” he held his hands up promptly.

  Some one behind him drew the pistol
from its holster in his belt, and having
made sure he had no other arms con-
cealed about him. said suavely:

  “ Thank you. I think you may drop
your hands now, if you wish. But don’t
make any noise.”

  The speaker stepped in front of him,
a slim youth in the uniform of an officer
of cavalry, and Sariol looked non-
plused for the first time.

  “ What means this outrage, senor
tcnicntc? ” he asked stiffly. “ Is the
vice-president of San Benito to be
treated thus by soldiers of ‘the repub-
lic?”

  “ Call up your men. and order them
to lay their arms down,” his captor or-
dered, as if he had not heard, and
Sariol did so.

  The troopers tramped along on foot,
leading the horses, and stared up to
where he was sitting.

They handed their weapons over at a
word from him, and were_bidden to

face about and get back to Cruz Alta
at top speed, on loot. A thing they set
out to do without delay, being only too
thankful that their throats had not been
cut.

  But Sariol was led, still smoking
philosophically, into the presence of
Major Armytage, who seemed pleased to

see him.

  " We met in Cruz Alta three years
ago, Don Quintin,” said that gentleman
in response to SarioFs puzzled inquiry.

  The vice-president looked relieved.

  “My old friend Don Antonio!” he
exclaimed. ''I am delighted. I might
have known. But then your men are
wearing our new uniforms. Von Rudolf
will be jealous if you don’t look out.
And when he hears how you rode

Out—zass.' He will be almost cross
with you. You’re brave, my old friend,
and, as they say, none but the brave de-
serve—success.”	.

  “ Ybarra's at the Golden Horseshoe? ”
Armytage asked as they sat down to-
gether by a deadwood fire within a hol-
low on the hillside.

  " He is. And it may interest you to
know that he intends to wed the Dona
Beatriz to-night. The hour is set for
half past nine, and I was on my way to
the ceremony.”

  He turned his head to hide the mali-
cious grin called forth by the major’s
startled malediction.

  " It's only half past seven now,” he
added tentatively, looking at his watch.
“ Fbere is still time.”

  “ Excuse me for five minutes," his host
interrupted, and calling Corbyn over
from an adjacent lire held whispered
conversation with him.

  Don Quintin made no demur when
he was presently requested to exchange
his clothes for a full cavalry uniform.
He yielded-up his papers without pro-
test and supplied the correct counter-
sign as if he had been performing an
agreeable duty. Which in part he was.
since any misfortune which might over-
take Ybarra would help his own suc-
cession. whereas, otice the president had
the mastery of his cousin’s millions, he
himself might look for a short shrift.

  It therefore suited his own hand to
help the Englishman, and. when that

  rash spirit rode forth on his risky er-
rand, he knew all that Quintin Sariol
could tell him concerning current dis-
positions at the Golden Horseshoe. That
did not amount to a great deal, since his
excellency had always been astute enough
to guard the secrets of his final refuge
very jealously, but Armytage was glad
to gather all the details thus available.

  The night passed quietly after he had
gone, and Don Quintin made himself
quite at home with his remaining hosts.
He was, at worst, a cheerful scoundrel,
with feW illusions as to honesty in walk
or conduct.

  “ In San Benito we are not yet civil-
ized,” he said to Allardyce as they sat
smoking, “ and might is right. My
friend Ybarra rules with a high hand,
and he has Von Rudolf to help him. but
now that there is a woman in the case
we may see changes.

  “ Lopez, of Paraguay, was still alive
when I was born, and he had cause to
curse the petticoats before he died.
Ybarra also calls himself * the Tiger,'
but as for me. 1 need no alias. When
the time comes I shall be merely Sariol.
the President, and at your service
always.”

  The bait was clumsy. Allardyce ig-
nored it and the other said no more.

  Next day hung very heavily on the
hands of those who were waiting the
news which did not come.

  The orders left by Armytage with his
subordinates were that they should stand
fast for four and twenty hours, where-
after. failing receipt of word from him,
they were to act as should seem to them-
selves most fitting.

  When dusk came down again. Corbyn
and Allardyce consulted long and anx-
iously. With them now lay responsibil-
ity for the next step and twenty lives as
well as their own depended on their
decision, wise or unwise.

  “ Let's put it to the others first.” Cor-
byn suggested, after they had formed a
plan wh. -e sheer foolhardiness had for
sole excuse the lack of any one more
feasible, and his friend readily approved
the proposition.

  “ You talk to ’em. old chap.” said
Allardyce, ’* and I’ll look after the vice-
president.”

  Corbyn agreed, and to the group
CLIPPING THE TIGER'S CLAWS.

which gathered round him while the
Englishman relieved the guard explained
the matter thus:

  “ The game’s against us, boys, at this
stage and we’re going to chance a bluff.
You know how weak our hand is, and
I'll tell you honestly that it may cost us
all our chips. If any of you feel like
coming in, it's boot and saddle right
away, but we’ll think none the worse of
those that stand out.”

  He stooped and loosened his own
horse’s halter from the picket-line, led
Allardyce’s also to the spot where their
accouterments were stacked and got both
ready for the road. Some one had
saddled Sariol's before he went back for
it. there was much noiseless bustle in the
neighborhood; and, when he numbered
off the ready rank in front of him, there
were just twenty men who had made up
their minds to go the limit.

  *' There’s no four-flushers in this
bunch,” said a gruff voice reprovingly.

  Corbyn laughed softly as he answered.
“ That’s a sure thing. McGuire.”

  They led their mounts, all fresh and
willing after the long rest, down to the
roadside, where they were on the point
of starting southward when from the
direction of Cruz Alta there was audible
the thud of many hoofs, the clank of
metal, the echo of an angry order.

  Out of the shadows which lay thick
in the ravine appeared two shaggy heads,
bent beneath wicked-looking horns and
swaying to and fro on heaving shoul-
ders* Slavering lips blew steamy breath
almost in Corbyn’s face before he real-
ized that he saw nothing more night-
marish than mountain-oxen. A span
of twenty shuffled past, the rear-
most yoke bent almost to the earth be-
neath the weight of a high two-wheeled
cart.

  The driver was on foot, wielding both
whip and goad. Perched up above him
on the vehicle there was a woman,
quarrelsomely inclined, to judge by the
way in which she presently began to rate
him for their slow progress. The man
made no reply beyond redoubling his
efforts to hasten the pace of his leisurely
team.

  “Halt, there!” cried Allardyce, and
at the words dark figures darted out
upon the driver, who obeyed with busi-

ness-like celerity. The woman sat quite
still and did not even scream.

  Corbyn ran up.

  “ Drop that gun," he said to her in
English. “ I've got you covered. Climb
down, quick! ”

  His tone was ominous, and she did as
she was bidden, descending from her
perch with the agility of a young girl.

  “ Who—who are you? ” she asked, her
accents thin and shaky as she peered in-
tently at the uniforms about her.

  And Corbyn snapped, “ Shut up,
Gonzalez. Don’t ask silly questions.”

  He had recognized his enemy’s voice.

  A hurried consultation resulted in the
release of the wagoner, who proved to
be a stupid peasant, pressed into the
present enterprise at pistol-point, and he
made off rejoicing, after he had handed
oyer all his passenger’s property, con-
sisting of a rifle, a rusty revolver, and a
full suit of man's apparel.

  As to Gonzalez they were in two minds
till Sariol begged speech of Allardyce
and helped them to a prompt decision.

  “ Where are you taking me? ” the spy
asked fearfully of the two troopers who
had bound his hands and were now
thrusting him toward a point where the
highway hung starkly over a deep gorge
within whose unseen depths a mountain
stream made mournful music. He tot-
tered as he walked, his teeth were chat-
tering, great beads of perspiration be-
dewed his pallid face. In his ridiculous
disguise he made a singularly unattract-
ive picture, and they who had heard of
the Hilario answered sternly, “To a
safe place.”

  He gave vent to a groan and would
have fallen but for their support.

  At the edge of the precipice they
dropped him, a huddled heap, and drew
back while a half-circle of their com-
rades hemmed him in with ready rifles.

  Corbyn had charge of the firing-
party.

  “ Get up, Gonzalez,” he adjured the
guilty wretch who was groveling wildly
at their feet.

  “ Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot, seiior! ”
that coward screamed. “ Show mercy
for a moment. It’s worth your while,
I'll swear. Don’t shoot! I’ll buy my
life from you. I’ll tell you evetything.
Don’t shoot! ”
644

  “ There’s nothing you can tell us we
don't know," said Corbyn. “ For the
last time, stand up.”

  “ My God! but wait,” protested the
doomed man. “ I’ll tell you how to
reach the senorita. I’ll take you through
the Golden Horseshoe.”

  “ If you could take us through the
Golden Horseshoe we might spare you—
for the present,” Corbyn interpolated in
a most disbelieving tone. “ But since

you can't-”

  “ I can; I can.” Gonzalez urged.

“ There is a way-”

  “Take him along with you,” said the
American contemptuously, and at the
words the whimpering poltroon was
picked up and led away.

  To the vice-president they bade a brief
farewell before they started and he ex-
pressed great pain at parting.

  “ Yes. I’ll go straight back to Cruz
Alta,” he assured them. “ I do not pine
to interfere between you and the Tiger,
although I should have liked to look
on—from a distance.

  “ Some day I may be able to serve
you, caballeros. Until then, discretion,
eh? That which has passed is safe as
between gentlemen. Command me to
his excellency. Good-by.”

  He went his way on foot, chuckling
contentedly, and they silently on into the
mountains.

  Gonzalez had no horse and they had
none for him. He tramped along, his
wrists fast to the stirrup-leathers of the
leading files, and was most useful there,
for, at two different points, the road was
picketed. He gave them timely warning
of the fact and they were able to pass
onward unmolested at sole cost of a
short detour in each case.

  At three in the morning they were
within long range of the ridge enclosing
the hacienda.

  “ There are two regiments behind it,”
he told them in a terror-stricken whis-
per. “ That foreign devil Von Rudolf
is in command. We must bear west
to where the stream comes forth, and

then-”

  He hesitated.

  “ What then ?" demanded Corbyn
suspiciously.

  “ There is the tunnel it flows through.”
  “ Which will be guarded! ”

  “ There is no guard, sen or. That is
the secret with which I have bought my
life.”

  He looked up furtively and licked his
dry lips, well knowing that the secret
might be worthless.

  “ Your life will be short unless we get
safely through,” Corbyn said grimly.

  Leaving the road, their way lay
through the broken country at the base
of that gigantic peak within whose skirts
the hacienda was hidden; soon they had
to dismount and lead their horses, but
in time they came to the .shallow gorge
through which the crystal torrent, re-
sponsible for the due irrigation of its
acres, had exit.

  There was no great head of water run-
ning, and Gonzalez gasped relief; had
the great sluice within the ridge been
wide there would have been small hope
for him.

  “ You’ll have to leave your horses,” he
explained.

  “Where?” asked Allardyce.

  “ There is an opening in the bank.
See—there. With grass and water in
abundance.”

  It was too late to balk at details, and
they left the animals behind, hiding the
saddles as best they could.

  A breathless scramble up the bed of
the stream took them to a low cavern in
the cliff-side. They entered blindly.

  Gonzalez led the way, a stirrup-leather
fast about his waist ; Allardyce held an
end of it in one hand, while in his other
was a cocked revolver.

  “ Make no false steps,” observed that
anxious follower, “ lest I should blow
your brains out by mistake.”

  “ Be very careful, senor,” begged his
guide uneasily. “ I’ll take you safely
through, upon my honor. A short half-
hour will see us on the other side.”

  Nor did he speak beside the mark, for,
five and twenty minutes later—five and
twenty years they seemed to the torn and
bedraggled climbers—the thick gloom
gave way to dim starlight and they
emerged within a well-like opening over
which waved ghost-like grass and
rustling leaves.

  Allardyce drew Gonzalez back into
the earth again.

  “ Why is this entrance left un-
guarded?” he inquired menacingly.
CLIPPING THE TIGER'S CLAWS.

645

  “ It is his excellency’s private exit,
only known to him—and me,” the spy
replied. “ By opening the water-gate
above it can be blocked.”

  “ Why is the gate closed ? ”

  “To fill the dam up for the garri-
son.”

•	They waited there till word came up
the line that the last man was within
touch, then Corbyn crept ahead to see
and make sure that their course was
clear.

  “ There's no one within sight or hear-
ing,” said Gonzalez. “ We’re well with-
in the ridge, and all the troops are kept
in close quarters there lest they should
spoil or destroy his excellency’s crops.
See, there’s Senor Corbvn signaling to
you.”

  Up above, in the open air, no time
was wasted.

  Gonzalez pointed out the black bulk
of the strange table-land on which
Ybarra’s refuge stood, and they held
straight for it in single file behind him,
their backs toward the twinkling points
of fire which told them that breakfast
was being made ready for the regalement
of the regiments set there to withstand
them.

  He did not lead them to the stair-
foot, where there was also a fire burning
and a sleepy sentry ready to discourage
visitors, but, skirting the other side of
the plateau, reached a long range of
cattle-sheds and byres.

  “ Be very cautious,” he. requested
breathlessly. “ The peons' quarters lie
beyond these buildings and there may be
dogs about.”

  Even as he spoke, one growled suspi-
ciously and a dozen others at once an-
swered it.

  “ Run! ” said Gonzalez, and they ran,
in time and no more to escape the pack
which came hotfoot upon their trail as
they shut to the door of the long stable
they had entered.

  They clambered to the loft above and
from there through an ivy-covered trap-
door into a crevice of the overhanging
cliff.

  At the far end there was a second door
for which Gonzalez had a key, and, once
within it, he assured them that there
would be no pursuit.

  “ Only his excellency comes and goes

by this and the water-gate,” he said.
“ The stair on which we stand leads to
his private chapel."

CHAPTER XI.

THE DISAPPEARANCE OF DOM AGUSTIN
    AND OTHERS RESULTS IN AN AP-
    POINTMENT FOR VON RUDOLF.

  “ I wish you wouldn’t press so hard
upon your pistol,” said Y'gnacio Ybarra.
“ It hurts my head.”

  “ You’ll have 110 head immediately,”
Armytage answered, and his trigger-
finger trembled as he heard a rustle at
his side.

  “ Unless,” he added, doubtfully,
“ you are prepared to carry out the or-
ders I shall give you.”

  “ Spare him—for my sake, Tony,”
cried a woman’s voice, and Beatriz Y'bar-
ra would have laid a timid hand upon
his arm but that he ordered her back
abruptly.

  “ Stand still! ” he said again in Span-
ish, “ or I fire.”

  “ Let no one move,” Y'barra echoed,
“ until I give the word.”

  Then their eyes met again, and he
continued: “Tell me what you would
have me do, and I—I’ll do it.”

  Armytage tried hard not to look re-
lieved. He had not dared to hope that
he could thus coerce his rival, who,
among many evil qualities, had never
been accounted a coward. Ybarra’s reck-
less disregard of death, his stubborn
courage, had helped him to the place
he held and enabled him to sit secure
where a more cautious man would most
assuredly have come to grief.

  His smooth assent to that which was
thus required of him, without demur or
counter-stipulation, made things much
easier for the Englishman.

  “ Order your men to ground their
arms," that strategist requested, and the
president complied.

  His words were audible throughout
the edifice. The rank and file laid down
their rifles; the staring subaltern in
charge cast sword and pistol clattering
on the tessellated pavement. He felt the
degradation of this strange surrender
keenly! but for Ybarra’s sake he yielded.
“ Say, friend,” Cornelius Kerrigan
616

THE ALL-STORY MAGAZINE.

broke in. “ I’m on your side. I'll help
you if you'll let me have a gun."

  “ Who is that man?" Armytage asked
'of Beatriz.

   “ Yes, he’s a friend; lie’ll help,” she
replied. “ I’ll take a rifle also, Tony.”

  “ Come up the steps, then, both of
you,” he said, and they came forward,
armed. Their reinforcement carried
matters more swiftly forward, ami when
Fifi also volunteered, the congregation
was quite cowed by the three rifles
leveled at them, while in the background
was his excellency, helpless in the hands
of a mysterious stranger, his very life
dependent on their prompt obedience.

  “ Have the church cleared." com-
manded Armytage. “ The women first
and then the workmen; the troops will
follow, with the lieutenant last.

   “ They are to leave the hacicnda by
the stairway. I have men posted there,
and any one who speaks ere ’he or she
sets foot upon the road below will be
shot down without a moment’s mercy.
The first shot fired will also sound your
death-knell. Bid them be very careful
to obey exactly.”

   An angry light shone in Ybarra’s eyes
even as lie confirmed this disposition.
He could not imagine by what means
Armytage had succeeded in obtaining
entrance for the men of whom that anx-
ious diplomat had spoken so glibly. He
could not know that there were only two,
or that these, in the uniform of his own
army, had replaced the topmost sentries
by the expedient of a flask of potent
spirit duly drugged. For the first time
he began to doubt the durability of his
luck. If his opponent held the stairway,
his own position would be doubly diffi-
cult.

   There was no present help for it. how-
ever, and he heard his wonder-dumb de-
pendents and his guards shuffle away in
silcnce. They streamed up the long
passage to its exit, out into the darkness,
down the stair past the two troopers sta-
tioned there, without a whisper.

   And when the keepers of the stair-foot
would have questioned them the women
broke and ran, with white lips, for the
safe shelter of the huts behind the
stables. ’Their men-folk followed sheep-
ishly, and after them the soldiery came
forth in impotent array.

  The last to reach ground-level was
the boy-officer who had been chosen to
command the guard of honor. His black
eyes were suffused with tears of shame,
his empty fingers twitched convulsively,
his cheeks were chalk-like in their pallor.

  He formed his men up and marched
off to camp, there to inform Von Rudolf
of that which had befallen.

  Ybarra was by this time bitterly re-
pentant for that he had not bidden the
general himself to attend the ceremony.
But he had been so secure in the inac-
cessibility of his private stronghold that
he had thought it more prudent to in-
sure the safeguarding of the outer gate.

  Furthermore, the said Von Rudolf had
to perfection that most debonair and
winning way with women which Don
Ygnacio was ever striving to attain, but
with equivocal success. It had not
seemed advisable to his excellency to
challenge comparison of himself with
the beau sabrcur in all the glory of full
regimentals, and it had seemed still less
so to expose that most susceptible young
man to further contact with the Dona
Beatriz.

  He was still cursing his precautions
for the general good when Armytage
stepped back and bade him stand up-
right.

  He did so gladly. The two rivals
faced each other for the first time since
they had dropped their masks. At one
side stood the girl for whom they were
prepared to fight to a finish. Fifi and
Kerrigan looked on, the latter with his
rifle ready for eventualities.

  Armytage asked his name and, learn-
ing it, knew who he was. Corbyn had
spoken of him.

  “ You know this place better than I.
Mr. Kerrigan,” he said pleasantly. “If
you will reinforce my men above-ground

I	shall be easier in my mind. The stair-
head must be held at any cost and if
there’s any other entrance to the
hacicnda, it will be well to guard that*
also. It won’t be long before we have
Von Rudolf to reckon with.”

  Cornelius sought a sign from Beatriz
and she nodded. He went away to car-
ry out the duty imposed on him, and.
when he found that all the company he
could count upon for the defense con-
sisted of two devil-may-care cavalry
CLIPPING THE TIGER'S CLAWS.

647

troopers with a West Point vocabulary,
he barely escaped brain-fever; but he
soon assimilated some of their ideas as
to the wisdom of evading worry until
that specter should assume a tangible
and concrete shape, and so sat down
to help them hold the fort there, since
he knew no other vulnerable point.

  While down below them the dum-
founded guardians of the stair-foot
squatted about their fire and spoke in
whispers of the incomprehensible move-
ments they had witnessed.

  “ You're foolish, Armytage,” Ybarra
said; “ to come here thus. You have me
at a disadvantage for the moment, but
you can scarcely hope to escape with
your prize. Can we not settle matters
amicably? I'm willing to make terms."

  Beatriz was about to speak, but
checked the impulse. Armytage was
looking fixedly at her half-cousin, whose
eyes «soon fell before the Englishman’s
straightforward glance.

  “ You take me for a fool, Ybarra.” he
answered presently; “ and perhaps you’re
right. I’d rather be an honest fool than
a clever rogue. But if you think I’m
fool enough to take your word for any-
thing, you’ve overshot the mark. Par-
don my speaking plainly, but it will be
best to understand each other.

  “ No terms that you could offer would
tempt me to trust you. Your reputation
is not that of a fool, and still less that
of an honest man.”

  The president’s pale face grew paler
and his teeth clenched under the unvar-
nished rejection of his right to treat in
honor with an enemy.

  It was so long since any one had dared
to twit him with his weaknesses that he
had grown to think himself no worse in
that/respect than any of his neighbors.
L^pon his pedestal of autocracy he had
been immune from criticism. Its per-
sonal application now stung him to the
verge of violent outbreak.

  But with an effort he controlled his
feelings.

  “ You have me at a disadvantage.” he
repeated. “ for the moment. What do
you mean to do? ”

  “ I have accomplished my immediate
object,” Armytage responded, “ which
was to prevent your molesting the lady
who will shortlv be mv wife. I don’t

know that I need discuss with you my
further plans.”

  “ It would perhaps be waste of time,
it' they have any reference to the Dona
Beatrix,'' Ybarra countered, and his
cousin at length broke silence.

  “ Tony," she said in a tense whisper,
and her lover held out his right hand.

  She moved toward him and he caught
her in a close embrace which somewhat
salved the hurt that his first words to
her had left. All the time he kept his
left arm free and both eyes fixed upon
his excellency, who was inwardly cursing
his astuteness.

  “ Tony,” she said again, and shyly
nestling against his shoulder. “ there’ is
a priest here. Why should we not-”

  “ We will, sweetheart,” he answered
rapturously, “ and right away. It was to
that end that I ventured to detain his'
reverence.

  “ Come forward, holy father. There
will be a ceremony, after all.”

  Dom A gust 111 obeyed with terror-
stricken readiness. Penned in beyond
the altar he had been prevented from
escaping with the parislyoners. and had
waited dumbly while the two men talked.

_ “ We’ll need another witness,” Army-
tage observed to the now blushing
Beatriz. “ Miss—Miss Florian might
perhaps ask .Mr. Kerrigan to step
down. I’d go myself, but it would not
be wise.”

  " I'll go,” said Fifi bravely, and
passed swiftly down the aisle. The
echo of her footsteps became fainter and
’then ceased.

  Ybarra ‘ moved an inch or two to one
side.

  “ Stand still,” his adversary- ordered,
and the words clicked like the snapping
of a steel trap. He stood still, since he
could see the blue-nosed bullets in the
revolver-barrel. His teeth showed bare
behind the black mustache and his whole
attitude was that of a beast about to
spring. Armytage held him at bay with
unwinking watchfulness.

  There was a sudden flash, and Beatriz
uttered a single strangled cry as she saw
Armytage sink to the floor without a
sound. So instantaneous had been the
impact of the great golden candlestick,
which the priest had used as missile, that
no shot, was fired. The stricken man
THE ALL-STORY MAGAZINE.

relaxed his trigger-f.nger with ‘he others,
and lay starkly still.

  Ybarra sprang at her and heid her
lips, his chaplain helping him to silence
her. Voices resounded from the stair-
way. Fifi and Kerrigan were coming
down together. The two men lifted her
and disappeared.

  She was aware of an unpleasant,
earthy odor and that they were descend-
ing. Almost immediately they stopped
and set her on her feet.

  And one said sneeringly, “ Your par-
don, cousin, if we have seemed rough or
hasty."

  She did not answer, knowing that
nothing she could say would help her
plight.

  The place in which they were stand-
ing was pitch dark, but she assumed that
It must be a crypt connected with the
chapel.

  Ybarra spoke again, quite confidently,
confirming her impression that it would
serve no purpose to cry out for help.

  “ Dom Agustin will lead the way,” he
ordered. “ Come, Beatriz. Tread care-
fully: the steps are slippery—in places."

  He led her forward, and she followed
his directions dumbly. They entered an
abruptly sloping tunnel and began a
journey which seemed never-ending.

  Their progress was slow : twice Y'barra
urged the priest ahead to greater speed;
but as he was about to speak a third
time, there resounded from in front a
bitter and blood-curdling cry—a long-
drawn wail that rose full-voiced with-
out a moment’s warning and thinned
away into illimitable distance like the
last echo of a lost soul's farewell. Even
Ybarra shivered.

  The girl beside him stopped and thrust
her fingers into her ears ; her knees were
trembling under her; she would have
fallen but that he upheld her and spoke
soothingly.

  “ Be brave,” he said. “ We are quite
safe."

  “ What—what was that ? she asked,
a shrinking horror of him in her tone.

  “ It must have been ... It was
. . . Never mind." he stammered.

11	we are quite safe."

  “ It was the priest,” she whispered
brokenly. 11 And—and—you knew that
he was going to his death.”

  “ I thought he Jtnew the secret," said
Y'barra sullenly. “ I would have warned
him. but ... It was an oversight—
an accident. I was not thinking—I am
not to blame. We must get on—away
from here. Come. Close your eyes if
you feel giddy. You need not fear while
I am with you.”

  He struck a light and looked about
him. His face was wet and ghastly.

  A few steps farther down there was a
cresset in the tunnel wall, and over
against it in a niche a plentiful supply
of pine-knots. He paused to kindle a
handful in the iron basket and the light
from them lasted until he had led his
unresisting companion across the chasm
into which their ill-fated predecessor
had fallen.

   It was a twelve-foot fissure within the
very heart of the titanic altar upon
which the hacienda stood, a crack which
came together overhead and at some dis-
tance on either side of the tunnel: below
it seemed to open out in bottle shape.

   Beatriz, looking unblinkingly into its
abysmal depths as Don Ygnacio guided
her to safety on the other side, saw for
herself the secret of which he had
spoken.

  The narrow stairway led directly to
its edge and began again upon the other
side. An infernal ingenuity had fash-
ioned the steps on both sides in such wise
that a stranger, either mounting or de-
scending in the dark, must surely slip
and so slide smoothly into space.

  For those who knew there was a nar-
row gallery, a two-foot ledge cut for a
man’s height in the rock around the
edge, skirting one corner of the open
mouth.

  Ybarra breathed more freely after
they had set another hundred steps be-
tween them and the gaping oubliette.

  "I hate this passage!" he said, sav-
agely. " I've always hated it. Thank
God, we're nearly through.”

   His spirits rose again, however, as soon
as they had clambered unobserved from
the ivy-covered cliff-face behind the
farm buildings on which the entrance
abutted. Thence they went forward to
Von Rudolf’s camp, and by the way
Ybarra chatted volubly.

  " Dom Agustin is dead.’’ he said re-
flectively, “ and more’s the pity. But

when the Spaniards ruled here—must
shoulder the responsibility.

   “ There is no other priest at hand and
 I must wait a day or two before I nomi-
 nate a new chaplain. He was a faithful
 fellow, Beatriz, and always wide awake.
 He caught my idea about the candle-
 stick at once—a telepathic sympathy, no
 doubt.”

   She bore with him because she must,
 but speechlessly, and was unspeakably
 relieved when the sharp challenge of a
 sentry interrupted his reminiscences; lor
 then he took upon himself again the dig-
 nitv of his high office and his habitual
 reserve.

  Von Rudolf galloped out to greet
them, when he heard of their miraculous
appearance at . the picket, and having
satisfied himself that it was really they,
made hasty disposition for their accom-
modation in camp, and walked at his
excellency’s side discussing all the as-
pects of the case and planning prompt
reprisals.

   They sauntered slowly through the
 lines, that their men might reassure
 themselves as to the president’s capacity
 for further mischief (the story that the
 guard of honor had brought back had
 not improved his prestige)—and see be-
 side him Dona Beatriz, the beautiful and
 the wealthy, upon whose whim, it had
 been rumored, depended all the back pay
 due them.

   Von Rudolf's field-pavilion had been
 swept and garnished for his excellency’s
 cousin. She pleaded fatigue and passed
 within, leaving the others to their own
 devices.

   Once inside, secure from observation
 or intrusion, she threw herself despair-
 ingly on the thick rugs with which the
 floor was covered. Her head fell for-
 ward on her forearm; two tears of mis-
 ery ran down her wrists, and then she
 slept, the deep and dreamless slumber of
 exhaustion.

  When she awoke, refreshed and
strengthened, it seemed strange to her
that day had not yet broken. The inner
chamber, where she lay, was dark, but
in the anteroom beyond a lamp was
still burning. And seated in a rocking-
chair, was Fifi Florian, busily sewing.

  She lay still for a moment, struggling
to recollect, somewhat bewildered. Be-
tween the curtains she observed Fifi rise,
as a step came softly toward the canvas
porchway, which was also discreetly
draped.

  Some one lapped gently and a hand
was thrust through with "a note. Fifi.

took the other; then she turned back and
read the note, scribbled a hasty answer

five fingers visible behind the screen,
gave vent to a coy giggle as they made a
grab at her and fled back to her rocking-
chair with much modest confusion and
a mincing gait.

  The hand was withdrawn and steps
died quietly away./

  “ Damn that fellow anyway! ” com-
mented the occupant of the rocking-
chai$ facing about with guilty haste as
Beartviz came through, laying finger on
lips with an imploring gesture.

  “ I’m one of Armvtage’s men,” he ex-
plained. “ My name is Allardyce."

  Beatriz looked at him with an ex-
pression of the most blank amazement.

  “ Kerrigan made me up,” he contin-
ued. as if anxious to dispel her doubts at
once. “ He would have come himself,
but I am more like Fifi.”

  She held a hand up and he paused.

  “ I don't—I can’t—where have you
come from?" she asked dully. “How
long have I been here?”

  He looked at her in turn, and what
he saw in her clear eyes helped him to
understand.

  “ You have been here for nearly four
and twenty hours,” he answered, speak-
ing distinctly. “ and much lias happened
in that time. I think you must have had
some opiate to make you sleep so long.

here as soon as Corney—Kerrigan, this
is—had fixed me up to look like Fifi.

  “ The pickets passed me readily
enough and 1 went straight to Von
Rudolf with a note from Armytage say-
ing that you would he sure to want your
maid. He brought me here and has been
corresponding with me ever since. I
told' him in reply to his last billet doux
that you were angry with him for
disturbing you and that he must stay
away until i want him.

  “ His excellency is at present on his
way here from Cruz Alta, where he went
yesterday to slaughter Quintin Sariol,
who, he thinks, is plotting to supplant
him. He intends to bring a priest back
with him.

  “ The coast is therefore as clear as it
will ever be, and. if you feel all right
again, we'd better go as soon as
possible.”

  “ Yes, I am wide awake now,” she
declared. “ 1 think they must have
drugged the glass of water that I drank
just before daylight. It seems so short
a time since I saw dawn across the
threshold. What chance is there of our
escaping from the camp ? ”

  “ Where is the glass you drank from? ”
Fifi's double asked, and she fetched it
along with a glass carafe still half full.

  Allardyce held it up to the light, then
shook it slowly. Its contents clouded
over, and he chuckled.

  “ They’re third-class criminals, and
clumsy ones at that.” he commented
cheerfully. “ Do you know Mr. Chal-
loner, Miss Beatriz?”

  She shook her head, and seemed sur-
prised.

  “ That’s all right then,” said he.
“ And now if you will—if you will
change your costume for that which I
have brought you in this suit-case, I’ll
have you safely settled at the hacienda
with the real Fifi by the time his
excellency comes to pay his morning
call upon you. But you must not delay
a moment in the process, please. If he
should catch us by the way-”

  She caught up the case and had dis-
appeared ere he could finish.

  He turned away and lifted up a corner
of the tiger-skin which covered a dim
corner of the anteroom behind the chair
in which she* had been sitting.

  “ The game's . afoot, old chap,” he
whispered. “ If any trouble comes to
you through the part you have played
send up the signal and I'll come to your
assistance.”

  “ The Wireless will be wild if they
hear how I’ve been behaving,” he
answered Challoner with a wry grin.
“ As for Ybarra, I don’t give a damn.
He doesn’t dare interfere with me. I've
too much pull. Crank up and get her
going."

  The Englishman dropped the rug
over him again, turned the lamp lower,
and passed swiftly to the porch. He
thrust a hand out through the curtains
there and waved it in a manner which
he hoped might be set down as ladylike
and languid. Soft footsteps once more
sounded on the sun-baked soil without,
and some one, stooping, kissed his
fingers.

  He shook with silent laughter, but
composed his features as Von Rudolf
pulled the screens apart and peeped in
roguishly.

  “ Angel adorable! ” whispered that
flatterer in French.

  But his charmer with shy gestures
indicated the necessity of caution, so in
pantomime he promised everything she
asked and, as she drew back before him,
crossed the threshold on tiptoe.

  She raised her eyebrows and held up
her hands, with a wild glance toward
the inner room, always retreating.
When he was opposite the rocking-chair
she signed to him to sit down, while she
assured herself that there was no one
watching.

  He did so willingly and waited with
a complacent smile, while she tripped to
the partition, laid an ear against it,
listened for the fraction of a second and
came back behind him.

  Flash-like Von Rudolf’s long legs
were shot out in front of him, the rock-
ing-chair tipped backward and a cravat
of cord, across his throat, cut short the
cry of anger and astonishment to which
he would have given voice.

  Allardyce choked him thoroughly and
there emerged, from underneath a tiger-
skin, one who, unseen, secured his ankles
first and afterward his wrists. It was
a very workmanlike garroting.

} b-l-.-d into his open mouth. To gag
him efficaciously was easy, and after that
he was quite powerless: sight, speech,
and hearing were shut off and the
languor of drugged impotence was
loosening hi# limbs.

  The Englishman made all his disposi-
tions at ti>p speed, then turned his atten-
tion io providing Challoner with an alibi
which should be unimpeachable. He
tied him also hand and foot, but tenderly,
tacked him a-''ay beneath the rug again,
patted his curly head approvingly and
held up a handkerchief.

  " Read;-, old chap?" he asked.

  The correspondent nodded.

    That was a tricky turn! " he said.
“ Give Armytage my love, and don’t
forget to tell him that I'm working for
the Wireless 1 don't mind lending him
a helping hand at an odd moment now
and then."

   “ I'll tel! him you're a wooden brick,"
responded Allardyce in a gruff voice.
“ What hope would 1 have had of get-
ting his girl back to him. if you hadn't
stepped up?”

  “ ’Nuff said." snapped Challoner.
“ Get busy with the rr.ouchrir or I’ll
bite yon.”

  He signified, as soon as he was gagged
and blinded, that he could live quite
comfortably till relief came. Allardyce
gave him a very gentle farewell pat, and
pulled the rug up carefully.

  There was another young man waiting
when, he rose. A shapely youth with
motor garb-and goggles, «h~>rt coat and
cap and puttee? all complete, but who
w3> blushing vividly.

  She started at the sight of Von Ru-
dolfs figure covered with a table-cloth
and stood aghast when Allardyce faced
her in the general’s field-uniform.

   “ It's I. all right." he said to reasrare
her. =' Do I look like him? "

  “ I thought it was he. and that you."
she answered, staring at the outline in
the chair.

  “ You're Challoner, a correspondent
of the Wireless. come through Cruz
Alta from/.he :ast in starch of news.''
he explained rapidlv. “Your motor-
bike's behind Von Rudolfs tent.

  “Yon Rudolfs going r,und the

pickets now and you'll go with him.
W hen we get to the outermost well have
to make a break for the stair-foot which
Armytage's men hold now. If anv-
thing goes wrong you'll run for it, wbOe
I keep any friends that follow us in
check. Whatever happens you make for
the hacienda. Ready?”

  *• Quite ready.”

  “ Off we go then, and—good luck
to us."

  He extinguished the lamp and thev
started.

  Their way led through the officers’
lines, and from the bell-tents the s >und
of snoring smote upon the small hours.
Beyond these were the servants'
bivouacs, rude shelters, screens of
platted grass. And then the kitchens,
where a night-cook. boiling water for
the duty detail, sprang to attention as
the}- passed and startled Beatriz so that
she all but screamed. Von Rudolf had
apparently succeeded in imbuing his
subordinates with a profound respect for
Austrian etiquette.

  Allardyce lifted a forefinger in per-
functory response and. looking back from
a safe distance, saw that the man had
squatted down beside his fire again.

  “ I think that we’ll pass current.” he
encouraged her.

  They followed the made road which
ran straight from the ridge to the stair-
foot and twice met orderlies bringing
reports in from the pickets. Allardyce
opened these and read them, striking
matches in the shelter of his great-coat,
his chin well down within the collar.

  The first of them be sent or. into
ramp, the second was instructed to re-
turn whence he had come and bid the
n; n-rommissic ned officer in charge await
the general’s arrival.

  Allardyce lit a cigarette and. taking
his companion by the arm. strode for-
ward chatting cheerfully in French of
the most nondescript. ’ As they ap-
proached the outpost set half way be-
tween the hacienda and the ridge he
stopped to illustrate a point of no im-
portance. puffing smoke the while.

THE ALL-STORY MAGAZINE.

  They had all but won through when
from behind sounded the call to arms.
A single rocket soared up and dropped
two blue stars. They heard the sound of
feet running after them and in front had
to face seven rifles waiting the word to
(ire.

  Allardyce gnashed his teeth and swore
vociferously at the picket’s corporal who
presently came forward and was most
apologetic when he saw the general, but
would by no means part with him.

  “It is*by your own order, general,”
he said appealingly, “ and you will
doubtless have me shot like those poor
fellows who let Senor Sariol through, if

I	do not obey the very letter of it. There
were two stars and that means ‘ hold all
comers whatsoever.’ It is by your own
order, general. My God! Do not push
past me or I’ll fire! ”

  “ Now run! ” cried Allardyce in such
a tone that his companion did not dare
to disobey. At that instant his left hand
shot forth, the corporal fell over back-
ward with a final grunt, while the mere
rank and file, too bewildered by such a
strange display upon the part of their
redoubtable chief to offer further resist-
ance, were glad to see him disappear
into the darkness ahead. As soon as
he was out of sight they judged it well
to open an aimless fire upon the sur-
rounding scenery.

  Two or three bullets whistled past the
fugitives, but they paid no attention to
such trifles. What frightened Allardyce
far more was the faint thud of hoofs be-
hind his hack, that did not die down,
but gained in volume, until he ktiew that
the pursuers must be dangerously nl’ar.

  “ Keep straight on,” he told Beatriz
abruptly and stopped short himself.

  She knew that it would only hamper
him if she should lag and went on. most
unwillingly, but with renewed energy.
If she were out of the way, there would
be more chance for him. She heard the
crack of his revolver and loud cries.

  A moment later she fell headlong into
the arms of a gray shadow traveling
outward at a great pace and with others
following behind.

  “Who's this?” it asked most anxious-
ly. She replied, “Tony! He’s back
there. Oh! quick—or you will be too
late.”

  Tie was too late and that though he
lost no single instant. There was a hot
skirmish in the dark between his bandful
and the hurried reinforcements which
had made the picket’s position impreg-
nable to him. But for the darkness he
would have been cut off from his own
base and even as it was he had to fight
hard to regain the stair-foot.

  There he found safety in the end, but
as he carried up the steep stone steps the
slim boy whose recovery had cost the
capture of another, his gray eyes were
dim, and he held Beatriz very tightly
to him, for she was doubly dear, since
she had cost so much.

  Fifi svas waiting at the top and led
Beatriz in to the house. Kerrigan and
Corbyn spent the remainder of the night
in proving to each other and to Army-
tage that when fate steps in. human effort
is of no avail.

  “ It’s just the narrowness that
pinches,” Corbyn concluded as day
broke. “ Less than a hundred yards we
lost him by, I reckon. I wish that he
had let me go instead.”

  A clear, cold dawn showed that the
plain beneath was empty save for the
customary outposts. The scant light
strengthened and the sun changed the
gray walls of their prison to gold.
Spirals of smoke rose slowly from the
ridge, and the world about them woke
without discord. It seemed that they
were not to be molested yet awhile, and,
since the hour for a daylight attack was
safely past, they tried to sleep.

  Then Beatriz came forth in her own
guise and paced the garden paths with
Armytage till Fifi came to call them to
breakfast. Both girls were heavy-eyed,
but strove to show a brave front to the
others. It was a melancholy morning.

  They fumed and fretted all forenoon
in forced inaction. It would have been
sheer madness to attempt a sortie and yet
every man among them itched to pro-
pose and to take part in it. Rut coramon-
sense prevailed and no one annoyed his
neighbors by suggesting an impossibility.
Their business was to get the women
safely to the coast and at all costs they
must attend to that.

  A sudden idea struck Kerrigan and he
communicated it to Armytage, whs.
jumped at it with concentrated eagerness.
CLIPPING THE TIGER'S CLAWS.

653

  “ Where did you say they signaled
from?” he asked “The south side?
Come along. We'll find the tackle if
it’s anywhere about the hacienda."

  Xor had they far to look, for under
a loose plank in the porch they dis-
covered all the signaling equipment
used for communicating with Cruz Alta
when his excellency happened to be in
the Golden Horseshoe.

  Armytage carried the tripod out and
Kerrigan the leather case containing the
two mirrors. They set the apparatus up,
sighted it on the main-guard at the
ridge and the major, to whom all such
matters were as an open book, sent an
insistent call across to the enemy.

  Within ten minutes there came back
an answering flash, and he held speech
with Don Ygnacio.

  His first inquiry was as to Allardyce.
Allardyce was alive.

  He asked if Don Ygnacio would ex-
change him honorably for Gonzalez, but
was informed that he might hang that
individual out of hand and so save Don
Ygnacio trouble. It seemed that Don
Ygnacio was not at all pleased with his
ex-spy.

  “ ‘ And—as to—the—Senor—Allar-
dyce.” Armytage read mechanically,
turning the text of the flickering message
into English for behoof of his listening
men. “ he will be shot—at—dawn—to-
morrow. The rest—of—you—will be
t reated—likewise — when—the—t ime —
comes! ”

  “ We need waste no more words on
him.” said the major curtly. “ I'll see
whether I can’t call up Cruz Alta.
Vice-President Sariol might do something
for us.”

  But ere he could achieve his purpose
it had been forestalled, a message from
the ridge forbidding the city to answer
any signals but those preceded by the
president’s cipher. All he could do was
to read off the news that came thence to
the camp, and since the bulk of that was
also coded he learned little.

  Corbyn and Kerrigan in turn took
their commander to one side in order to
propound to him a private plan whereby
each might take Allardyce’s place: or.
failing that, lead a forlorn hope to his
rescue. It was, of course, impossible
for Armytage to countenance such a

suggestion, or he would have gone forth
himself.

  Fortune had called a forfeit, fixing on
Allardyce to pay it. That he would do
so with'good grace affd manliness no one
doubted. The irrevocable could not be
gainsaid, no matter what it might cost to
look on.

  Next morning they could not help but
rise early, so sleepless had the night been.
Standing upon the cliffs they once more
watclied the dawn and heard the minutes
tick away.

  The doomed man’s friends saw clearly
through their glasses all that passed.
There was a band, which played a dismal
parody of the dead march, and, close
behind it, a rough coffin on a cart. After
the cart there walked a woman, closely
guarded.

  Armytage groaned aloud.

  “ Poor chap! ” he said. “ They’ve
made him wear the clothes he was
disguised in. What an inhuman brute
Ybarra is! ”

  The sad procession halted half way
between the two opposing camps, and
waited there until all the troops visible
had massed upon it. They formed a
hollow square, on one side of which a
dozen sappers had dug a narrow, shallow
grave.

  The woman stepped toward it without
hesitation and stood facing the firing
party, while an officer acting as provost-
marshal declaimed in a loud voice her
crime and its sentence. Faint echoes of
his speech floated to the hacienda on the
rare atmosphere.

  And while the men there strained their
ears in a vain effort to catch a chance
word, they heard a cheery voice behind
them saying:

  “ Gad! but I’m glad to see you all
again.”

  It was Allardyce himself, who shook
hands with therh after they had got over
their first fright.

 “What’s doing down there?” he
asked wonderingly.

  As he spoke, a thin, white, straggling
vapor wreathed the rifles of the firing-
party, the woman in front of them fell
forward on her face and lay there, very
still. A sudden, discordant crackle
sounded jarringly upon the silence.

  And, at that moment, Beatriz \ barra.

 Ginger Handasyde’S Home-Coming.

By Robert Ai I ken.

  a long-absent lover, whose
  second return dispelled the
  grief his first had brought. J-

  T was very hot in Sao Pedro.

      The fat ship-chandler’s clerk am-
bling along the shady side of the
Calle Desierta paused for a moment
to mop his moist countenance with an un-
pleasant-looking pocket-handkerchief. In
order that he might do so the more con-
veniently he dropped upon the dusty
pavement the tiny octagonal tin case,
labeled for the mail, which he was car-
rying toward the lifeless post-office at
the end of the street, and leaned his
great white, green-lined umbrella
against his shoulder.

  The laths in the outlook of a sun-
shutter behind him moved creakingly. A
pair of hot. feverish eyes, peering out in
vain quest of coolness or change, rested
fretfully for a moment on the blinding
brightness of the discarded package and
were instantly withdrawn. The way-
farer, glancing mechanically upward,
saw only the impenetrable screen.

  ■A pariah dog paused perfunctorily to
nose the glittering jetsam and he kicked
it in the ribs. It snapped at his ankles
and fled in haste with a mouthful of
trouser-leg.

  The fat man swore sanguinarily in
seven languages, and disregarding in his
wrath the adverse climatic conditions,
sought with exceeding fervor some
scheme of retaliation. The dog lay
down in the dry gutter at a distance,
with a view to making a meal of its
mouthful.

  The prayerful eye of the avenger

lighted upon the twinkling tin. He
picked it up again, thankfully, sidled
down the street in the shadow of the
houses, and casting his missile with Teu-
tonic accuracy, smote the enemy to its
hurt. Wherefore he recovered the case
and pursued his way peacefully, under a
halo of perspiration, pocketing, with ten-
der solicitude, the half-chewed shred of
cloth which the cur had dropped.

  The incident thus ended, Paul Me-
thuen, who had witnessed it with lan-
guid amusement, lay back in his chair
again with a groan of disgust.

  He might have been a passenger by the
same steamer which would take the par-
cel away from Sao Pedro but for a
bout of fever which, coupled with Gin-
ger Iiandasyde’s unaccountable failure
to turn up in time, had caused him to de-
lay his departure for another week. It
made him tired to think of such misfor-
tune, and—in five minutes he was fast
asleep.

  Sleep is scarce and precious during the
long days and nights when the Norte
blows across Brazil like the breath of a
blast-furnace. I-t is worth more to an
invalid than many doctors, and when a
grating, guttural voice recalled Methuen,
the recently recovered, from the
snow-sweet realm of dreams to a hate-
ful, sweltering consciousness of mundane
misery, that irritable convalescent rose
limply from his lounge, resolute to shed
the blood of the injurious soliloquist.

  It was the ship-chandler's clerkvwho,
addressing to the still apparent mongrel
noisy, Judas-like endearments, would
fain have decoyed it within reach of his
resentment. He was still carrying the
curious case, had evidently missed the
mail, and held it morally responsible for
the mischance.
GINGER HANDASYDE’S II i.ME-COMING.

655

   Methuen, lacking personal interest fh
grievances other than his own. opened
fire upon him with an overripe orange.
The bullet found its billet on the nape
of the unconscious alien’s neck.

   That injured individual almost broke
down under the bespattering misfortune
which had thus befallen him. but faced
about and entered into acrimonious ar-
gument. In the midst of this he threw
the tin. with great cunning and swiftness,
at his aggressor’s head.

   Methuen caught it deftly, weighed it
for a moment in one hand that he mighi
the more rakiiiglv return the compliment,
and—fell fainting.

   His projectile clattered over the win-
dow-sill onto the flags. The fat man
once more retrieved it hastily, and melt-
ed away in silence.

   The dog barked delightedly, and hav-
ing composed itself to slumber, snored
audibly throughout the afternoon.

   It was very hot in Sao Pedro.

  Up-river, a hundred miles from the
seashore, it was, if anything, hotter, and
Ah Chow, chopping wood in the pri-
meval forest, sighed wearily.

   His heart was not in his work ; his
'thoughts were wandering. It therefore
happened quite suddenly that he
chopped a joint off his left forefinger.

   His attention thus pointedly recalled
to the matter in hand, he dropped his im-
plement and eyed the damaged digit
frowningly.

   “ Velly dam luck! ’’ said Ah Chow.

   He tore a thread from the ragged shirt
which composed his costume, and with
the help.of his teeth tied it tightly about
the wounded finger. Then he lit a small
fire, heated the blade of his chopper
therein with great patience, and cauter-
ized the bleeding stump unflinchingly.

   As soon as the chopper was onre more
cool he went on deliberately with his
chopping.

   Toward sunset he rested from his la-
bors in that direction, setting himself
instead to the tying up of neat little
bundles of fagots with cordage of flex-
ile creepers.

When he had builded up a yellow
man’s burden of these he shouldered it
uncomplainingly', and made his way with
cautious steps toward ‘an extremely in-
>

eligible abode pitched on foot-high piles
above the sodden bank of a sluggish
stream which wandered through the
dankness of the undergrowth like a
wounded serpent, wherein, on a couch
of dry leaves, lay Ginger Handasyde, de-
lirious.

  Ginger was no coward, but he had
fled from Sao Pedro to escape the epi-
demic which seemed likely to decimate
the scanty population of that insalubri-
ous spot.

  He had been risking his life there for
five long years in order to accumulate a
competence, and now that he had almost
achieved his object, had not scrupled to
flee before the plague until such time
as he should be ready to set sail from its
stronghold for good and all.

  That was already arranged. He had
promised to accompany Paul Methuen
by the Cotopaxi at the end of April, by
which time the balance of his modest
fortune would be forthcoming in cash.
With it in his hand he would go back
to civilization and match the March-
mont millions for a wife.

  Such was the proposal. But the dis-
posal was otherwise, for it fell out that
the fever followed him. He was one of
the first to be stricken by it in the lit-
tle country village whither he had re-
treated.

  Help there was none. The populace
was panic-stricken, believing that he had
brought the pestilence within their walls.
They pursued, with him, the time-worn
tactics of superstitious ignorance, turn-
ing him out into the wilderness to die—
as live—as an all-wise Providence should
ordain ; and the chief of police officially
annexed his portmanteau, which was a
new one and looked quite nice once his
initials had been inked over.

  In deference to his obvious gentility,
they exiled with him the surprised Ah
Chow, professional vagrant, and ordered
that unfortunate to see the matter
through under pain of their most pro-
nounced displeasure. After which they
forgot all about both, for the sickness
ceased.

  Ah Chow, having pondered the situa:
tion deeply, decided to carry out the trust
imposed upon him. He had found it not
unprofitable in the course of his career
to deal justly by such of the human race

as were of ruddy countenance, with' red
hair and blue eyes., lie knew, more-
over, that he might well be shot at sight
by any black-browed local patriot who
should chance to find him wandering
from the narrow path of duty, and in
view of all these inducements to well-
doing set himself philosophically to tend
his gratuitous charge, whom he feeling-
ly described, for his own private edifica-
tion, as “ velly sick pidgin.”

  He was by no means a bad servant,
and he was also a fatalist. He made his
patient as comfortable as might be un-
der the very uncomfortable circum-
stances, keeping house for him on such
slender resources as were to be had for
the gathering within the great forest
which hemmed them in.

  (.linger grew rapidly worse, and Ah
Chow, who had acquired an easy liking
for the helpless white man, correspond-
ingly sorrowful. Sorrow and fatalism,
with a blending of sanitary instinct, in-
duced the faithful Chinaman to cut much
fire-wood, which he persisted in stor-
ing immediately underneath the rotten
floor of Mr. Handasyde’s temporary
dwelling, and Mr. Handasyde’s cursory
objections to this dangerous habit he met
with diplomatic evasiveness.

  Ginger spoke rationally to him at in-
frequent intervals, and Ah Chow always
answered civilly to the best of his ability,
lightly undertaking many ill-understood
commissions of importance in order that
his master might sleep with an easier
mind, until, at the end of an interminable
week, that sufferer did drop off.

   He slept for twelve hours, and Ah Chow,
watching over him, grew very weary.
He slept for twelve more, and the Ce-
lestial decided that it was high time to
jog the memory of that particular joss
which had so evidently forgotten a worn-
out Chinaman at his post.

  He looked long and carefully at the
motionless figure on its leafy couch, held
a steel mirror to the breathless lips in
vain, stood upright dizzily, and shook
his head with doleful significance.

  He placed his last handful of rice
and. a pinch of rock-salt upon the Head
man’s breast, moistened thtj lips of the
corpse with water against the long jour-
ney.' groaned heartrendingly, and ap-
plied a light to the carefully prepared

•	pyre. The dry fagots flamed up, sobbed
•inwardly, and were all ablaze.

  Ah Chow sat -down at a safe distance
and closed his" tired eyes, moralizing in
the Confucian manner upon the muta-
bility of human purpose until an indig-
nant family of monkeys stopped his snor-
ing with a shower of nuts. Having
now overcome his mixed emotions, he
returned to the site of the riverside
mansion, which was now 110 more.

  The most prized of the poor Orien-
tal's worldly possessions was a small oc-
tagonal tin, of curious workmanship, in-
wrought with quaint devices in the shape
of dragons and serpents, enwrapped in
blue paper bearing the announcement:

  “ Ly Chee.”

  This he sacrificed upon the altar of
friendship, soaking it in the stream un-
til its gaudy wrapper was 110 more, pol-
ishing it with the plenteous mud to an
exceeding brightness.

  He took two double-handfuls of pro-
miscuous gray ash from the heap which
represented the deceased, dropped them
decorously into the tin, and having' also
enclosed a calling-card, inscribed with
certain shaky words, entrusted to him by
Ginger in an interval of sanity, soldered
the lid back into its place with a brand,
from the fresh fire. That accomplished,
he departed coastward circuitously, satis-
fied that he had done his best for all.

  Arriving at Sao Pedro after manifold
and blood-curdling trials, he sought out
Samuelsen, the ship-chandler, from
whom it had been his habit in happier
days to purchase pennyworths of pre-
served ginger, and laid before that unin-
terested individual an addressed envelope
containing a letter written by the de-
funct American, as also the tin coir-
taining all that was left of the letter.

  By some species of legerdemain he
produced, from nowhere in particular,
the sum of two milreis in small change,
the harvest of a somewhat prolonged
plowing in the wilds of Brazil, and
having spread that out upon the counter,
departed penniless to hire himself, in
the capacity of cook, to the skipper of a
Swedish bark then lying in the roads.
This, later on, had to be abandoned 011
the high seas because of the contagion
which went on board with the China-
man.
GINGER’ HA'NP’ASYDE’S HOME-COMING.

  He was no longer visible when Mr.
Samuelsen again looked up from his
ledger and that gentleman was consid-‘‘
erably incensed by his casual conduct,
but, notwithstanding, instructed his
clerk to forward the aforesaid letter and
parcel to the address indicated on the
envelope; which the clerk finally did at
the inclusive cost of one and a half mil-
reis, two trips to the post-office, and a
vast amount of grumbling.

  He and his employer were then taken
very sick, and had to stay in bed for a
fortnight before they felt better. Neither
they nor the Swedish skipper can speak
of Ah Chow without emotion to this
day.

  In due course, and after being disin-
fected by the quarantine officials, the let-
ter reached its destination on Long
Island Sound, an<f*May Marchmont felt
uncommonly glad, when she had read it,
that she had had faith enough in the
future to refuse that morning, for the
fifth time, the unconditional offer of her
cousin Tommy’s hand and heart.

  Five years is a long past to x mod-
ern maiden of three and twenty, and
Tommy's annual appeal had served to
remind her, however unnecessarily, that
she had had no word from the other
in all that interval; for Ginger, poor,
proud, and dipped in debt before his de-
parture, had not dared to put his aspira-
tions into words ere he set forth for for-
eign parts in search of that fortune
which should enable him to make her a
similar and more acceptable offer.

  Wherefore, perhaps, he had main-
tained a higher rank in her esteem than
any of the other suitors who had come
and gone in his absence.

  His written message was a formal one.
but she could read between the lines,
and what she saw there brought bright-
er color to her cheeks. It would be her
turn now to call the main, and—she
owed this Mr. Handasyde some sleepless
nights.

  Should she take toll of him, when he
appeared, for the -quixotic stubbornness
which had kept them apart, which might
easily have cost them both their
happiness? Or should she rather re-
ward at once the single-minded purpose
which had brought him back from the
struggle to. sge. for his prize? She

  •	6-S

laughed delightedly and went indoors out
of the sunshine," making her way toward
the drawing-room, whence sounded the
voices of visitors.

  There was evidently a man among
them, and she thought it only kind to
round up Tommy, the disconsolate, for
his more masculine entertainment. That
youth she discovered in a very dejected
attitude and a capacious armchair be-
fore the fire in the billian 1-room. He
made no objection to honoring his aunt's
tea-table with his presence, given that
there was another male on the spot to
support him against the opposite sex,
and followed his cousin back to the
drawing-room obediently, although with-
out enthusiasm.

  A tall, thin, cadaverous-looking stran-
ger rose to intercept them as they came
forward, and with a simultaneous start
they recognized Paul Methuen.

  “How d’ ye do, Miss Marchmont?”
said that wanderer cheerfully, and held
out his hand. “ How do. Tommy?
How’re things with you? All brisk,
eh?”

  They returned his greeting warmly,
and having saluted the other guests, re-
turned to talk. Paul had been a great
friend of theirs before he went abroad.

  “ And • how are you ? ” May asked.
“ You don't look very-”

  “ Strong as a horse,” he reassured her
heartily, “ and quite ready for a good
time. I had a go of fever, y’ know, and
lost weight a bit, but I’m all right now.”

  Thus euphemistically did he describe
the very narrowest escape from death at
which the overworked Danish doctor in
Sao Pedro had ever connived during a
long experience of that joyless spot.

  11	How did you leave Gerald Handa-
syde, Paul?” asked Mrs. Marchmont’s
gentle voice, and her daughter listened
intently.

  " Quite well last time I saw him,”
Methuen answered. “ He went up-river
to get away from the fever. It’s been
pretty bad this summer—or winter, as
you call it here.”

," What sort of fever?” Tommy in-
terpolated, and the traveler turned to-
ward him again.

  “Yellow Jaqk,” he explained' in a
lower tone. " A nasty, dirty sort of sick-
ness. Knocks a man out in quick-time—

and then they cremate you in case you
recover."

  “ I’ve heard of it," said Tommy.
“ When's Ginger coming home?”

  May’s heart sank as Methuen frowned
and shook his head, but she could feel
the edge of the envelope in her lap, and
that helped to uphold her.

  “Extraordinary thing!” he replied.
“ Ginger and I agreed, months ago, to
travel by the same steamer; but he didn't
turn up, although I waited a week for
him, and I've had 110 news of him since.

  “ Perhaps we’ll hear by the next boat.”

  More people came in, and there was
nothing else said on that subject. Tea
over, a move was made toward the ten-
nis-courts, and Paul claimed May as his
partner for the first set on the plea of his
own rustiness; but she did not seem to
be in the best of form, either, and they
were hard pushed by their opponents.

  The appearance of the station-messen-
ger trundling up the avenue on his wheel
afforded them a pretext for a moment’s
breathing-space while she inspected the
mail.

  Paul Methuen, watching her admi-
ringly as she came tripping back across
the turf, saw with sudden horror that
she was carrying poised on her racquet
what seemed a faithful duplicate of the
curious case which he and the ship-
chandler’s clerk had used for projectile
in the Calle Desierta a few short weeks
before. He felt a sudden dryness of the
mouth as she dropped it outside the
court, and his play became so shocking
that the other side had no difficulty in
bringing the game to an early conclusion.
Whereupon he apologized lamely, and
she went off laughing to welcome some
new arrivals, so that the ill-omened arti-
cle lay where she had left it until Tom-
my Marchmont, passing, picked it up.

  “ More cigarettes. May?” he asked in
jest.

  “ Open it,” she answered, “ to dis-
prove the libel.”

  The case was tightly soldered, how-
ever, and the inquisitive youth had some
difficulty in broaching it with his knife;
but he finally managed to cut round the
lid, and forcing the jagged ends back,
handed it to his cousin, while half a
dozen of the loungers looked on with
idle curiosity.

  She peered into it half fearfully, and
inserting her hand, drew forth a calling-
card, soiled and smeared with fine gray
dust.

  Methuen, watching the process with
a fascinated stare, a sick anticipation of
evil, sprang forward to save her, but he
was too late; the card fell fluttering
from her fingers as she pitched forward
on the grass, unconscious.

  Ah Chow's tin treasure had been lying
in the Handasyde burial-place for a full
week before May Marchmont could re-
cover from the shock of its arrival; and
then she went down-stairs again to face
things out. Since she had sold hei
heart's secret to the world she would
take the consequences without crying in
public.

  She blushed hotly when Paul Me-
thuen met her in the hall—he had fallen
into the habit of riding over every day
to ask for her—but he kept his eyes else-
where and talked triflingly. so that she
soon recovered her self-possession and
was even glad of his countenance as
they entered the crowded drawing-room
together. In the midst of that ordeal
Tommy came in, and the two men car-
ried her off to a quiet corner where they
entrenched themselves, one on each side
of her, and under pretense of being des-
perately hungry, occupied themselves
with eating and drinking.

  Paul was in the act of taking a large
bite out of a larger muffin when the
drawing-room door was opened from
without and a hysterical housemaid an-
nounced : " Mr. Gin—Gerald Handa-
syde.”

  A frozen silence fell upon the com-
pany as a gaunt-looking individual, not
unlike the dead man save for the dam-
ning difference between his snow-white
hair and the flaming shock which had
been the hall-mark of the genuine Gin-
ger. advanced shamefacedly toward
them, and no one answered his ingra-
tiating “ Good evenin’.”

  He flushed, and stopped short. Paul
Methuen sprang up with a stifled ex-
clamation, confronting him squarely.
Tommy reenforced his friend, and the
two together shouldered the stranger
quietly but firmly out of the room.

struggle to be still. The others, in pity
for her plight, took up again their bro-
ken sentences, and a low buzz of con-
versation once more filled the room.

  Outside in the hall three angry men
were eying each other unpleasantly, un-
til at length the newcomer spoke for the
second time.

  “ What's the matter with you all ? ”
he demanded with great indignation.
“Are you mad—or what?”

  “ Damn it, man,” Methuen answered
as fiercely. “ you’re dead! Dead an’
buried—an’ cremated at that! "

  “ I’m nothing of the sort, you fool! "
said the specter savagely. “ You’re mad,
at any rate.” And it turned to Tommy.

  “ Well,” it inquired coldly as he
gaped vacantly in its direction. “ Are
you Tommy Marchmont—or a paralytic
idiot ? ”

  “ Ginger, old fellow! ” Paul Me-
thuen interrupted in a choking voice.
“ Ginger, old fellow, is it really you? ”
“Is it really me?" the apparition
mocked without regard for grammar.
“If I didn’t know you too well, Polly
Methuen, I’d try to knock some of the
silliness out of your fat head. Who d’ ye
think it is, that you must bounce up and
boot me out of this room when I drop
into a friend’s house for a cup of tea?

  “ You’re ratty, my lad; that’s what’s
the matter with you! Take my tip and
swear off for a time till you get the
knots out of your noddle.”

  Methuen gulped down his joy, arid
unappalled by this utterance from the
tomb, seized one hand of the wraith,
which he shook like a pump-handle.

  “ Ginger, old fellow! ” he repeated
ecstatically. “ Ginger, old fellow ! ”
And did not for a moment leave off
his hand-shake.

  Tommy bolted back into the drawing-
room.

  “ It’s him! ” he cried, and at the
words his cousin ran past him into the
hall, so that when the less impulsive of
the gathering followed her they were in
ample time to behold the edifying spec-
tacle of a beautiful heiress locked in the
arms of a haggard and by no means
lovely lover.

  Gerald Handasyde was haled into the
drawing-room again, and tljere held
forth for a time-concerninir the manner

of his most marvelous resurrection; but
the billiard-room edition of his adven-
tures, which was shorter and more to the
point, must serve the purpose of these
pages, wherein brevity is the soul of
worth.

  “ I saw the dirty heathen popping his
beastly bundles under my bed,” said
Ginger wrathfully, while Tommy held
a glass for him and Methuen poured,
“but I'd no idea of the trick he in-
tended to play me.

  “ I was feeling sort of cheap at the
time, and thought a ten minutes’ snooze'd
do me a lot of good; but if you’ll
believe me, I’d no sooner closed my eyes
than the worthy Ah Chow lighted me
up and cleared.

  “ I’m pretty hardy, but not quite
hardy enough to stop in bed when the
blankets are burning, so I vamoosed the
ranch, one-time. Nothing to wear but
an old top hat of the heathen's that I
grabbed in passing, all my money raked
in by the local aristocracy before they
footed me out into the forest, an' devil
a shave for weeks—I didn’t need a
mirror to know that I was a beauty!

  “ I strolled over toward the village to
investigate, but some sportsman with a
second-hand rifle headed me off at the
outskirts, which I took as a warning that
I need never hope to be a welcome guest
there.

  “ I struck out for the coast—it took
me ten days to cover the distance—and
when I at last reached it my troubles be-
gan. But I borrowed a pair of trousers
from a man I met—that’s the mark of
his knife on my neck; he didn’t want
to oblige me—and swam out to an old
dago windjammer that was loading tim-
ber in a creek I came to.

  “ The skipper shipped me as a dis-
tressed seaman, and 1 worked my way to
New York. Got there last night, and
wired you first thing this forenoon, Pol-
ly, you brute! You’ll find my message
when you get home, I suppose.”

  “ Aftd what about Ah Chow ? ” asked
Tommy thoughtlessly.

  “What about Ah Chow?” Ginger
answered, with great earnestness. “ Well,
I think I'll have enough left out of the
wreck to burv him handsomely.

  “ When I next meet Ah Chow' he will
suddenly cease.”

SYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS CHAPTERS.

COLONEL GAJLLARD, with his younger son, Radnor, receives his nephew, Arnold
Crosby, the narrator, at his Southern place, Four-Pools Farm. Arnold learns that
the elder son, Jeff, disinherited by his father, has evidently gone to the bad out West, and
that the negroes are terrified by a " ha'nt" that has appeared at Four-Pools. That night
he sees a repulsive negro, " Cat-Eye Mose,” sneaking with a bundle to where the ha'nt was
seen. He tells his suspicions to his hosts, who laugh at him.

    Radnor and Jim Mattison, the sheriff, are rivals for Polly Mathers. At a dance at Four-
Pools, Radnor, in a sheet, plays the ha’nt. After some time he rejoins his guests, strangely
excited. Polly snubs him. That night Arnold sees him sneak off mysteriously.

   Radnor and Mose now have some secret. Ugly stories are circulated about Radnor
and the ha’nt, some of which come to Polly, who becomes even colder.

   Mose secs the ha’nt and is terrified. Arnold sees Radnor again at night. This time
he drives away with a mysterious some one. Hardly has he gone when Mose rouses the
household by his fright at having seen another awful ha’nt in the house.

   Next morning five thousand dollars in bonds and cash is missing from the safe.
Radnor, though perturbed, will not tell where he spent the night, but vows he knows
nothing of the robbery. Ill feeling arises between himself and the colonel, who engages
a detective. He reports that Radnor is guilty, but Crosby keeps this from the colonel,
whose mental state is now of the worst, and who breaks out and brutally beats a negro
suspected of chicken-stealing.

   A trip is made to the Luray Cave. Polly Mathers leaves her coat in the cave and the
colonel turns back for it. Radnor disappears, to turn up again very much excited, while
the colonel fails to appear, and Crosby in anxiety sets out again for Luray, where he
discovers the dead body of the missing man.

   Crosby suspects Cat-Eye Mose, the more so that he has disappeared, and offers
a reward for his apprehension; but the rest of the community believe Radnor guilty,
because of the quarrels that he and his father had had, and because of the strangely
excited condition that the young man was in on the day of the murder. Radnor will do
little to help his cause, being so reticent that Crosby feels sure that he is shielding some
one, and that the mysterious "ha'nt” is somehow involved. Jim Mattison is especially
vindictive against Radnor, much to the disgust and grief of Polly, who is much broken
up over the affair and shows that she is devoted to Radnor. Crosby, believing that the
culprit may be the scapegrace brother, Jeff, telegraphs concerning him, but gets the reply
that on the day of the murder Jeff was at his home in the West. The situation becomes
hopelessly involved, and Radnor, at the inquest, makes so poor a showing that he is sent
to jail. Then all of a sudden Jerry Patten, an old friend of Crosby's and an exceedingly
clever New York newspaper man, sends word that he is coming down to solve the
mystery.

feeling that he could find the bottom of
any mystery. It was with a deep breath
of relief that I held out my hand.

   “ Hello, old man! How are you! ”
he exclaimed with a smile of cordiality
as he grasped it.

   Then recalling the gravity of the sit-
uation, he with some difficulty pulled a
sober face.

       JERRY COMES.	*

TH E moment I caught sight of
     Jerry as he swung off the train
     I felt involuntarily that my
     troubles were near their end.

His sharp, eager face, with its firm
jaw and quick eye, inspired one with the

  “ I’m sorry that we meet again under
such sad circumstances,” he added per-
functorily. “ I suppose you think I’ve
meddled enough in your affairs already;
and on my word, I intended to stay out
of this.

   “ But. of course, I’ve been watching it
in the papers: partly because it was in-
teresting and partly because I knew you.
It struck me yesterday afternoon as I
was thinking things over that you weren’t
making much headway and might like
a little help; so I induced the Post-
Despatcli to send down their best man.
I hope I shall get at the truth.”

  He paused a moment and looked at
me sharply.

  “ Do you want me to stay? I will go
back if you say so."

  I was instantly ashamed of my dis-
trust of the afternoon. Whatever might
be Jerry’s failings, I could not doubt,
as I looked into his face, that his Irish
heart was in the right place.

   “ I am not afraid of the truth,” I re-
turned steadily. “If you can discover
it. for Heaven’s sake do so! ”

  “ Well, that’s what I’m paid for,"
said Jerry. “ The Post-Despatch doesn’t
deal in fiction any more than it can
help. It’s a terrible affair,” he added
briskly, as we climbed into the carriage.
“ The details, as I have them from the
papers, are not full enough, of course,
but you can tell them to me as we drive
along.”

  I should have laughed had I been
feeling less anxious. His greeting was
so entirely characteristic in the way he
shuffled through the necessary con-
dolences and jumped, with such evident
relish, to the gruesome details.

  As I gathered up the reins and backed
away from the hitching-post, Jerry
broke out with:	,

  “ Here, hold on a minute. Where are
you going? ”

  “ Back to Four-Pools,” I said in some
surprise. “ I thought you'd want to un-
pack your things and get settled.”

   “ I haven’t much time to get settled,”
he laughed. “ I have an engagement in
New York the day after to-morrow.
How about the cave? Is it too late to
visit it now ? ”

   “ Well,” I said dubiously, “ it’s eight
miles across the mountains and pretty

heavy roads. It would be dark before
we got there.”

  “As far as that goes, we could visit
the cave at night as well as in the day-
time. But I want to examine the neigh-
borhood and interview some of the
people; so I suppose,” he added with an
impatient sigh. “ we’ll have to wait till
morning. And now, where’s this young
Gaillard? "

  " He’s in the Kennisburg jail.”

  “ And where’s that ? ”

  “ About three miles from here and six
miles from the farm.”

  " Ah—suppose we pay him a visit first,
then. There are one or two points con-
cerning his whereabouts on the night
of the robbery and his actions on the
day cSf the murder that I should like to
have him clear up.”

  I smiled slightly as I turned the
horses’ heads toward Kennisburg. Rad-
nor, in- his present uncommunicative
frame of mind, was not likely to afford
Jerry much satisfaction.

  “ There isn't any time to waste,” said
Jerry, as we drove along. “ Just let me
have your account of everything that
happened, beginning with the first ap-
pearance of the ghost.”

   I briefly sketched the situation in Four-
Pools as I had found it on my arrival
and the events preceding the robbery and
the murder.

  Jerry interrupted me once or twice
with questions.

  He was particularly interested in the
three-cornered situation concerning Rad-
nor, Polly Mathers, and Jim Mattison.
and I was as brief as possible in my re-
plies; I did not care to make Polly the
heroine of a Sunday feature article. He
was also persistent in regard to Jeffer-
son’s past.

  I told him all I knew, added the story
of my own suspicions, and ended by pro-
ducing the telegram proving his alibi.

  “ H’m! ” said Jerry, folding it
thoughtfully and putting it in his pocket.
“ It had occurred to me, too, that Jeff
might be our man—this puts an end to
the theory that he personally committed
the murder.

  “ There are some very peculiar points
about this case," he added. “ As a mat-
ter of fact. I don’t believe that Radnor
Gaillard is any more guilty of the crime

  than I am—or I shouldn’t have come.
  But it won’t do for me to jump at con-
  clusions until I get more data. 1 sup-
  pose you realize what is the peculiarly
  significant point about the murder?”
  “You mean Mose’s disappearance?”
  “ Well. no. I didn't have that in
  mind. That’s significant enough, to be
  sure, but nothing but what you would
  naturally expect. The crime was com-
  mitted, if yoifr data is straight, either by
  him or in his presence, and of course he
  disappears. You could scarcely have ex-
  pected to find him sitting there waiting
  for you, in either case.”

    “ You mean Radnor's behavior on the
  day of the murder and his refusal to
  explain it?” I asked uneasily.

   “No," Jerry laughed. “That may
 be significant and it may not. I strongly
 suspect that it is not. What I mean is
 the peculiar place in which the crime
 was committed. No person on earth
 could have foreseen that Colonel Gail-
 lard would go alone into that cave.

    “ There is an accidental element about
  the murder. It must have been commit-
  ted on the spur of the moment by some
  one who had not premeditated it—at
  least at that time. This is the point
  we must keep in mind.”

    He sat for a few moments staring at
  the dashboard with a puzzled frown.

    “ Broadly speaking,” he said slowly,
  “ I have found that you can place the
  motive of every wilful murder under
  one of three heads—avarice, fear, or
  revenge. Suppose we consider the first.
  Could avarice have been the motive for
  Colonel Gaillard’s murder? The body
  had not been robbed, you tell me?"

    “ No, we found a gold watch and con-
  siderable money in the pockets.”

    “ Then, you see, if the motive were
  avarice, it could not have been immediate
  gain. That throws out the possibility
  that the murderer was some unknown
  thief who merely took advantage of a
  chance opportunity. If we are to con-
  ceive of avarice as the motive, the crime
  must have been committed by some per-
  son who would benefit more remotely by
  the colonel’s death. Did any one owe

*	him money that you know of?"

    “ There is no record of anything of
  the sort, and he was a careful business
  man. I do not think he would have

loaned money without making some mem-
orandum of it. He held several mort-
gages, but they, of course, revert to his
heire.”

  “ I understood that Radnor was the
only heir."

  “ He is, practically. There are a few
minor bequests to the servants and to
some old friends.”

  “ Did the servants know that anything
was to go to them ? ”

  “ No, I don’t think they did.”

  “ And this Cat-Eye Mose, did he re-
ceive a share? ”

“ Yes, larger than any of the others.”
“ It seems that Colonel Gail lard, at
least, had confidence in him. And how
about the other son? Did he know that
he was to be disinherited ? ”

  “ I think that the colonel made it plain
at the time they parted.”

  Jerry shook his head and frowned.

  “ This disinheriting business is bad. I
don't like it, and I never shall. It stirs
up more ill feeling than anything I know
of. Jeff seems to have proved an alibi,
however, and we will dismiss him for the
present.”

  “ Rad has always sympathized with
Jeff,” I said.

  “ Then,” continued Jerry, “ if the
servants did not know the contents of the
will, and we have all of the data, Rad-
nor is the only one who could knowingly
have benefited by the colonel's death.

  “ Suppose we take a glance at motives
of fear. Do you know of any one who
had any reason to stand in fear of the
colonel? He wasn’t oppressing anybody?
No damaging evidence against any per-
son in his possession? Not levying black-
mail, was he?”

  “ Not that I know of.” and I smile'’
slightly.

  “ It's not likely," mused Jerry, 11 but
you never can tell what is going to come
out when a respectable man is dead.

  “ And now as to revenge. With a
man of Colonel Gaillard’s character,
there were likely to be a good many
people who owed him a bad turn. lie
seems to have been a peppery old gentle-
man. It’s quite likely, is it not, that he
had some enemies among liis neighbors? ”
“ No, as far as I can discover, he was
very popular in the neighborhood. The
indignation over his death was something

tremendous. When it first got out that
Rad was accused of the crime, there was
even talk of lynching him.”

  “ And the servants all appeared to be
fond of him? ”

  “ The old family servants were broken-
hearted at the news of his death. They
had been, for the most part, born and
bred on the place, and, in spite of his
occasional harshness, they loved the
colonel with the old-fashioned devotion
of the slave toward his master.

  “ He was in his way exceedingly kind
to them. The night that old Uncle
Eben died, my uncle watched all night
by his bed.”

  “ It's a queer situation,” Jerry mut-
tered. and relapsed into silence till we
reached the jail.

  It was an ivy-covered brick building
set back from the street and shaded by-
trees.

   Rather more sumptuous than the
Tombs,” Jerry commented. “ Shouldn't
mind taking a rest in it myself.”

  We found Radnor pacing up and
down the small room in which he was
confined, like a caged animal; the anx-
iety and seclusion were beginning to tell
on his nerves.

  He faced about quickly as the door
opened, and at sight of me his face light-
ened. He was growing pathetically
pleased at having any one to talk to.

  “ Rad,” I said with an air of cheer-
fulness which was not entirely assumed,
“ I hope we’re nearing the end of our
trouble at last. This is Mr. Patten—
Jerry Patten, of New York, who has
come to help me unravel the mystery.”

  It was an unfortunate beginning; I
had told him before of Jerry's connec-
tion with the Patterson-Pratt affair. He
had half held out his hand as I com-
menced to speak, but he dropped it now
with a slight frown.

  “ 1 don’t think I care to be inter-
viewed," he remarked curtly. “ I have
nothing to say for the benefit of the
Post-Dts patch.”

  “ Oh. you'd better,” said Jerry, im-
perturbably. “ The Post-Despatch prints
the truth, you know, and some of the
other papers don’t. The truth's always
best in the end. I merely want to find
out what information you can give me
in regard to the ghost.”

  “ I will tell you nothing," Radnor
growled. “ 1 am not giving statements
to the press.”

  “ Mr. Gaillard." said Jerrv, with an
assumption of gentle patience, “if you
will excuse my referring to what I know
must be a painful subject, would you
miud telling me if the suspicion has ever
crossed your mind that your brother Jef-
ferson may have returned secretly, have
abstracted the bonds from the safe, and
two weeks Uter. quite accidentally, have
met ColonerGaillard alone in the cave? ”
Radnor turned upon him in a sudden
fury. I thought for a moment he was
going to strike him. and I sprang for-
ward and caught his arm.

  “ The Gaillards may be a bad lot. but
they are not liars and they are not cow-
ards. They do not run away : thev stand
by the consequences of their acts.”

 Terry bowed gravely.	- •

  " Tust one more question and I am
through. What happened to you that
day in the cave?"

  “ It's none of your damned business! ”
I glanced apprehensively at Jerry, un-
certain as to how he would take this.
He did not appear to resent it He
looked Radnor over with an air of inter-
ested approval, and his smile slowly
broadened-

  “ I'm glad to see you’re game." he re-
marked.

  “ I tell you I don’t know who killed
my father any more than you do,” Rad-
nor cried. “ You needn't come here
asking me questions. Go and find the
murderer, if you can, and if you can't,
hang me and be done with it.”

  “ I don’t know that we need take up
any more of Mr. Gaillard’s time." said
Jerry to me. “ I’ve found out about all I
wished to know. We’ll drop in again.”
he added reassuringly to Radnor.
“ Good afternoon.”

  As we went out of the door he turned
back a moment and added with a slightly
sharp undertone in his voice:

  “ And the next time I come. Gaillard,
you’ll shake hands! ”

  Fumbling in his ’pocket, he drew out
my telegram from the police commis-
sioner and tossed it on to the cot. “ In
the meantime, there’s something for you
to think about. Good-by."

  “ Do you mean,-' I asked as we

climbed back into the carriage, “ that
Radnor did believe Jeff guilty?”

  “ Well, not exactly. I fancy he will
be relieved, though, to find that Jeff was
two thousand miles away when the mur-
der was committed."

  Only once during the drive home did
Terry exhibit any interest in his surround-
ings," and that was when we passed
through the village of Lambert Corners.

  He made me slow down to a walk and
explain the purpose of everyone of the
dozen or so buildings along'the square.
At “ Miller's store " he suddenly decided
that he needed some stamps, and I wait-
ed outside while he obtained them, to-
gether with a drink in the private back
room.

  " Nothing like getting the lay of the
land," he remarked as he climbed back
into the carriage. “ That Miller is a
picturesque old party. He thinks it’s all
tommyrot that Radnor Gaillard had any-
thing to do with the crime. Rad’s a cus-
tomer of his, and it’s a downright impo-
sition to lock the boy up where he can’t
spend money.”

  For the rest of the drive Jerry kept
silence, and I did not venture to inter-
rupt it. I had come to have a super-
stitious feeling that his silences were por-
tentous.

  It was not until I stopped to open the
gate into our own home lane that he
suddenly burst out with the question:

“ Where do the Mathers people live? ”
“ A couple of miles farther down the
pike—they have no connection whatever
with the business and don’t know a thing
about it.”

  “ Ah—perhaps not. Would it be too
late to drive over to-night?"

  “ Yes,” said I, “ it would.”

  “ Oh, very well,” said he good-hu-
moredly. “ There’ll be time enough in
the morning.”

  I let this pass without comment, but
on one thing I was resolved; and that
was that Polly Mathers should never fall
into Jerry’s clutches.

  JL! Well, here we are,” I said, as we
came in sight of the house, “ and the
took is expecting us.”

V",So that is the Gaillard house, is it?
/f"wne olcl place. When was it built?”
“ I’m not sure. About 1830, I imag-
ine.”

  “ And that row of shanties down
there?”

  “ Are the haunted negro cabins.”

  “ Ah! ”

  Jerry rose in his seat and scanned
them eagerly-

  “ We’ll have a look at them as soon
as 1 get something to eat. Really, a
farm isn’t so bad,” he remarked as he
stepped out upon the portico.

  “And is this Solomon?” he inquired
as the old negro came forward to take
his bag. “ Well, Solomon, I’ve been
reading about you in the papers. You
and I will have a talk by and by.”

CHAPTER XVI.

WE SEARCH THE ABANDONED CABINS.

  “ Now,” said Jerry, as Solomon and
the suit-case disappeared up-stairs, “ let’s
have a look at those haunted cabins.”

  “ I thought you were hungry ? ”

  “ Well, I am, but I still have strength
enough to get that far. Solomon says
supper won’t be ready for half an hour,
and we haven’t half an hour to waste.
I’m due in the city the day after to-
morrow, remember.”

  “ You won’t find anything.” I said.
“ I’ve searched every one of those cabins
myself and the ha’nt didn’t leave a trace
behind him.”

  “ I think I’ll just glance about with
my own eyes,” said Jerry. “ Reporters
sometimes see tilings, you know, where
corporation lawyers don’t.”

  “Just as you please,” I shrugged.
“ Four-Pools is at your disposal.”

  I led the way across the lawn and into
the laurel growth. Jerry followed, with
eyes eagerly alert; the gruesome possibil-
ities of the place appealed to him. He
pushed through the briers that surround-
ed the first cabin and came out on the
slope behind, where he stood gazing
down delightedly at the dark waters of
the fourth pool.

  “Gee! This is great. We’ll run .i
half-page picture and call it the
‘Haunted Tarn.’ I didn't know
places really existed; thought writer-.;

  "Come on,” he called, plunc _ V

  YVe commenced at the first cabin and
went down the row thoroughly and sys-
tematically. At Jerry’s insistence one of
the stablemen brought a ladder and we
climbed into every loft, finding nothing
but spiders and dust.

  The last on the left, being more
weather-proof than the others, was used
as a granary. A space six feet square
was left inside the door, but for the rest,
the room was filled nearly to the ceiling
with, sacks of Indian meal.

  “ How about this—did you examine
this cabin ? ”

  “ Well, really, Jerry, there isn’t much
room for a ghost here.” -

  “ Ghosts don’t require much room;
how about the loft?”

  “ I didn’t go up—you can’t get at the
trap without moving all the meal.”

  "I see!” Jerry was examining the
three walls of sacks before us. “ Now,
here is a sack rather dirtier than the rest
and squashy. It looks to me as if it
had had a good deal of rough handling.”
He pulled it to the floor as he spoke,
and another with it. A space some three
feet high was visible; by crawling one
could make his way along without hit-
ting the ceiling.

  “Come on!” said Jerry, scrambling
to the top of the pile and pulling me
after him, “ we’ve struck the trail of our
ghostly friend unless I’m very much mis-
taken. Look at that! ”

  He pointed to a muddy footmark
plainly outlined on one of the sacks.

  “ Don't disturb it; we may want to
compare it with the marks in the cave.
Hello! What's this? The print of a
bare foot—that’s our friend Mose."

  He took out a pocket-rule and made
careful measurements of both prints; the
result he set down in a notebook. I was
quite as excited now as Jerry.

  We crawled along on all fours until
we reached the open trap; there was 110
trace here of either spider-webs or dust.
We scrambled into the loft without much
difficulty, and found a large room with
sloping beams overhead and two small
windows, innocent of glass, at either end.

  The room was empty, but clean; it
had been thoroughly swept, and recently.
Jerry poked about, but found nothing.

  “ H'm! ” he grunted. “ Mose eleaned
well. Ah! Here we are!”

  Lie paused before a horizontal beam
along the side-wall and pointed to a
little pile of ashes and a cigar-stub.

  “ Lie smokes cigars, and good strong
ones—at least, he isn’t a lady. Did you
ever see a cigar like that before ? ”
“Yes,” I said, “that’s the kind the
colonel always smoked. A fresh box
was stolen from the dining-room cup-
board a day or so after I got here. Solo-
mon said it was the ha’nt, but we sus-
pected it was Solomon.”

  “ YY’as the cupboard unlocked?”

  “ Oh, yes; any of the house servants
could have got at it.”

  “ Well,” said Jerry, poking his head
from the windows for a view of the
ground beneath, “ that’s all there seems
to be here; we might as well go down.”
We boosted up the two meal-bags
again, and started back toward the house.

  Jerry’s eyes studied his surroundings
keenly, whether for the sake of the story
he was planning to write or the mystery
he was trying to solve, I could only con-
jecture. His glance presently fixed on
the stables, where old Uncle Jake was
sitting on an upturned pail in the door-
way.

  “ You go on," he said. “ and have ’em
put dinner or supper or whatever you
call it on the table, and I’ll be back in
three minutes. I want to see what that
old fellow over there has to say in re-
gard to the ghost.”

  It was fifteen minutes later that Jerry
reappeared.

  “ Well,” I inquired, as I led the way
to the dining-room, “did you get any
news of the ghost ? ”

  “Did I? The Society for Psychical
Research ought to investigate this neigh-
borhood. They’d find more spirits in
half an hour than they've found in their
whole past history."

  Jerry’s attention during supper was
chiefly directed toward Nancy's fried
chicken and beat biscuits. When he did
make any remarks he addressed them to
Solomon rather than to me. H.is ques-
tions principally concerned the house-
hold and the farm, and Solomon in vafti
endeavored to confine his replies to “ yes
sah,” “ no, sah,” “ jes’ so, sah,” but iu
five minutes he was well start*!, afoitnt
would have required a floodgate to stop
him.
666

THE ALL-STORY MAGAZINE.

  In the midst of it Jerry rose and, dis-
missing me with a brief “ I’ll join you
in the library later; I want to talk to
Solomon a few minutes,” bowed me out
and shut the door.

  I was amused rather than annoyed by
this summary dismissal. Jerry had been
in the house not quite two hours, and I
am sure that a third person, looking on,
would have picked me out for the
stranger. Jerry’s way of being at ease
in any surroundings was absolutely inim-
itable.

  He appeared in the library in the
course of half an hour with the apology:
“ I hope you didn’t mind being turned
out. Servants are sometimes embar-
rassed, you know, about telling the tilth
before any of the family.”

  “ You didn't get much truth out of
Solomon," I retorted.

  “ I don’t know' that I did,” Jerry ad-
mitted with a laugh. “ There are the
elements of a good reporter in Solomon;
he has an imagination which I respect.
The'Gaillards appear to be an interest-
ing family with hereditary tempers.”
“That may be,” I doubtfully acqui-
esced.

  “H’m!” Jerry frowned. “And Sol-
omon tells me tales of the colonel him-
self whipping the negroes—there can't
be any truth in that?”

  “ But there is,” I said. “ He didn’t
hesitate to strike them when he was
angry. I myself saw him beat a nigger
a few days ago,” and I recounted the
story of the chicken thief.

  “ I see! A man of that sort is likely
to have enemies he doesn’t suspect. And
how about Cat-Eye Mose? Was Colonel
Gaillard in the habit of whipping him? ”
“ So I understand; but the more the
colonel whipped Mose, the fonder Mose
appeared to grow of the colonel.”

   " It’s a puzzling situation,” said Jerry.
He took off his coat and rolled up his
shirt-sleeves; then, shoving everything
back from one end of the big library-
table, he settled himself in a chair and
motioned me to one opposite.

  “Now, see here.” he said, “you told
me you weren't afraid of the truth. Just
be so kind as to tell it to me, then. Now,
exactly what sort of a fellow is Radnor?

I	want to know for several reasons.”

  “ Well, he did drink a little,” I said,

“ but he had stopped lately. And as
for gambling, several of the young men
around here have got into the way of
playing for rather high stakes, but for a
month or so past Rad had pulled up in
that, too.

  “ As for his ever having been disin-
herited, that is a newspaper story, pure
and simple. I never heard anything of
the sort, and the neighborhood has told
me pretty much all there is to know
within the last few days.”

  “ His father never turned him out of
the house, then ? ”

  “ Never that I heard of. He did leave
home once because his father insulted
him, but he came back again.”

  “ That w’as forgiving,” commented
Jerry. "In general, though, I under-
stand that the relations between the two
were rather strained?”

  “ At times they were,” I admitted,
“ but things had been going rather better
for the last few days."

  “ Until the night before the murder.
They quarreled then? And over a mat-
ter of money?”

  “ Yes. Radnor makes no secret of it."
“ And if you will allow me to go a
step farther, why did Colonel Gaillard
object to settling something on the boy? ”
“ He wanted to keep him under his
thumb. The colonel liked to rule, and
he wished every one around him to be
dependent on his will.”

  “I see,” said Jerry. “Radnor had
a real grievance, then, after all—just one
thing more on this point. Why did he
choose that particular time to make his
request ? "

  I	shrugged my shoulders.

  “ You’ll have to ask Radnor that,” I
remarked. I had my own suspicions,
but I did not wish to drag Polly Math-
ers’s name into the discussion.

  Jerry watched me a moment without
saying anything, and then he, too,
shrugged his shoulders.

  “ I won’t go into the matter of Rad-
nor's connection with the ha’nt just now.
I should like to consider first his actions
on the day of the murder. I have here
a report of the testimony taken at the
inquest, but it is not so full as I could
wish in some particulars.

  II	You say that Radnor and his father
did not speak at the breakfast-table.
THE FOUR-POOLS MYSTERY.

667

How was it when you started on the
picnic ? "

  “ They both appeared to be in pretty
good spirits, but I noticed that they
avoided each other.”

  “ Did you notice Radnor through the
day? ”

  “ Not particularly.”

  “ Did you see either him or the colonel
in the cave?”

  “ Yes, I was with the colonel most of
the time.”

  “ And how about Radnor? Didn’t you
see him at all?”

  “ Oh, yes. I remember talking to him
once about some queerly shaped stalag-
mites. He didn’t hang around me, nat-
urally, while I was with his father.”

  “ And when you talked to him about
the stalagmites—was there any one else
with him at the time?”

  “ I believe Miss Mathers was there.”
  “ And he was carrying her coat ? ”

   “ I really didn’t notice.”

  “ At least, he left it later in what you
call the gallery of the broken column?”
“ Yes.”

  “ I see,” said Jerry, “ that the coroner
asked at this point if he were in the habit
of forgetting young ladies’ coats. That’s
more pertinent than many of the ques-
tions the coroner asked. How about it?
Was he in the habit of forgetting young
ladies’ coats?”

  “ I really don’t know, Jerry," I said
somewhat testily.

    It's a pity you're not more observ-
ing,” he returned, “ for it’s rather im-
portant on the whole. But never mind.
I’ll find that out for myself. Did you
notice when he left the rest of the
party?"

  “ No, there was such a crowd of us
that I didn’t miss him.”

  “ Very well, we’ll have a look at his
testimony. He left the rest of you in
this same gallery of the broken column,
went out, strolled about the woods for
half an hour, and then returned to the
hotel. I fancy ‘ strolled ’ is not precise-
ly the right word.

  “ Now, that half hour in the woods is
an unfortunate circumstance. Had he
gone directly to the hotel from the cave,
we could have proved an alibi without
any difficulty.

  “ As it is, he had plenty of time after

the others came out to remember that he
had forgotten the coat, return for it, re-
new the quarrel with his father, and
after the fatal result make his way to
the hotel while the rest of the party
were still loitering in the woods.”

 “jerry-” I began.

  He waved his hand in a gesture of
dissent.

  “ Oh, I’m not. saying that’s what did
happen. I’m just showing you that the
district attorney’s theory is a physical
possibility.

  “ Now, let’s glance at the landlord's
testimony a moment.

  “ When Radnor returned for his horse
he appeared angry, excited, and in a
hurry. Those are the'landlord’s words,
and they are corroborated by the stable-
boy and several loungers about the hotel.

  “ He was in a hurry—why? Because
he wished to get away before the others
came back. He had suddenly decided
while he was in the woods—probably
when he heard them laughing and talk-
ing as they came out of the cave—that
he did not wish to see any one.

 “ He was angry—mark that. He
lashed his horse quite unnecessarily as he
galloped off. And he was not, Solomon
gives me to understand, in the habit of
maltreating horses.

  “ Now, what do you make of all this?
Here is a young man with an unexpended
lot of temper on his hands—bent on be-
ing reckless; bent on being just as bad
as he can be. It’s as clear as daylight.

  “ That boy never committed any crime.
A man who had just murdered his father
would not be filled with anger, no mat-
ter what Ihe provocation had been. He
might be overcome with horror, fear, re-
morse—a dozen different emotions, but
anger would not be among them. Young
Gaillard had not injured any one; he
himself had been injured. He was mad
through and through, and he didn’t care
who knew it.

  " He expended the most of his bel 1*;--
erency on his horse on the way home.
By evening he was probably considerably
ashamed of his conduct. He doesn't
care to talk about the matter for several
reasons. Fortunately. Solomon is not so
scrupulous.”

  “ I don’t know what you're driving at.
Jerry,” said I.
6G8

THE ALI.-STORY MAGAZINE.

    “ Don’t you?” he inquired. “ I don't
 know myself, but 1 think I can make a
 pretty good guess. We'll call on Miss
 IV.lv Mathers in the morning and see
 if she can’t help us out.”

    “Jerry," I said, “that girl knows no
 more about the matter than 1 do.”

   He ignored my remark and went on
 with:

    '■ There are just two more points con-
 necting Radnor Gaillard with the murder
 that need explaining: the footprints in
 the cave and the match-box. The foot-
 prints I will dismiss for the present.

   “ But the question of the match-box
 may repay a little investigation. I want
 ' you to tell me precisely what happened
 in the woods that day before you went
 into the cave. In the first place, how
 many older people were there in the
 party ? ”

   “ Mr. and Mrs. Mathers, a lady who
 was visiting them, and Colonel Gail-
 lard.”

   “ There were two servants, I under-
 stand, besides this Mose. to help about
 the lunch. What.did they do?”

   “ Well, I don’t know exactly. I
 wasn't paving much attention. I be-
 lieve they carried things over from the
 hotel, collected wood for the fire, and
 then went to a farm-house for water.”

    “ But Mrs. Mathers, it seems, attended
 to lighting the fire?”

   “ Yes, she and the colonel made the
 fire and started the coffee.”

   “Ah!” said Jerry, with a note of
 satisfaction in his voice. “ The matter
 begins to clear. Was Colonel Gaillard
 in the habit of smoking?”

   “ He smoked one cigar after every
 meal.”

   “Never any more than that?”

   “ No. the doctor had limited him.
 The colonel grumbled about it regularly,
 and always smoked the biggest cigar lie
 could find."

    “ And where did he get his matches? ”
 “ Solomon passed the brass match-box
 from the dining-room mantel-piece just
 as he passed it to us to-night.”

   “ Colonel Gaillard was not in the
 habit of carrying matches in his pockets,
 thc*r
 " Nn, I think not."

    “ We may safely assume,” said Jerry,
 “ that in this matter of making the fire.

if the two were working together, the
colonel was on his knees arranging the
sticks while Mrs. Mathers was standing
by, giving directions. That. 1 believe, is
the usual division of labor.

  “ Well, then, they get to the point of
needing a light. The colonel feels
through his pockets, finds that he hasn't
a match, and—what happens?”

  “ What did happen," 1 broke in, “ was
that Mrs. Mathers turned to a group of
us who were standing talking at one side,
and asked if any of us had a match, and
Rad handed her his box. That i~ the
last any one remembers about it.”

  “ Exactly.” said Jerry. “ And I think
I can tell you the rest. You can see for
yourself what took place. Mrs. Mathers
went back to the spot where they were
building the fire, and the colonel took the
match-box from her.

  “ No man is ever going to stand by and
watch a woman strike a match—he can
do it so much better himself.

  “ At this point, Mrs. Mathers—by her
own testimony—was called away, and
she doesn’t remember anything further
about the box.

  “ The colonel was left to light the fire
alone. He recognized the box as his
son's, and he dropped it into his pocket.
At another time, perhaps, he would have
walked over and handed it back; but
not then. The two were not speaking
to each other. Later, at the time of the
struggle in the cave, the box fell from
the old man’s pocket, and formed a most
damaging piece of circumstantial evi-
dence against his son.

  “ On the whole, I had arrived at my
own conclusions from reading the
papers; what extra data I needed, I
managed to glean from Solomon’s lies.

  “ And as* for you,” he added, gazing
across at me with an imperturbable grin.
“ I think you were wise in deciding to
be a corporation lawyer.”

CHAPTER XVII.

JERRY ARRIVES AT A CONCLUSION.

  “ And now," said Jerry, lighting a
fresh cigar, and after a few preliminary
puffs settling down to work again. “ we
will consider the case of Cat-Eye Mose.
It won’t be my fault if we don't make a
THE FOUR-POOLS MYSTERY.

beautiful story out of him. You, your-
self, I believe, hold the opinion that he
committed the murder?”

  “ I am sure of it," I cried.

  “In that case,” laughed Jerry, "I
should be inclined to think him inno-
cent.”

  I shrugged my shoulders. There
was nothing to be gained by getting
angry.

  If Jerry chose to regard the solving
of a murder mystery in the light of a
joke, I had nothing to say; though I
did think he might have realized that to
me, at least, it was a serious matter.

  “ And you base your suspicions, do
you not, upon the fact that he has queer
eyes ? ”

  “Not entirely.”

  “ Upon what, then ? ”

  “ Upon the fact that he took part in
the struggle which ended in my uncle’s
death.”

  “ Well, certainly, that does seem rather
conclusive—there is no mistake about the
footprints? ”

  “ None whatever; the Mathers negroes
both wore shoes.

  “ In that case, I suppose it’s fair to
assume that Mose took part in the strug-
gle. It says here that the bootmarks
of two different men are visible.”

  “ That’s the sheriff’s opinion.” I re-
plied. “ But I myself can’t make out
anything but the marks of Mose and the
colonel. I examined everything care-
fully, but it’s awfully mixed up, you
know."

  “ As I understand it,” said Jerry,
" Mose has the reputation of being a
harmless, peaceable fellow, not very
bright, but always good-natured. He
never resented an injury, was never
known to quarrel with any one, took
what was given him, and said thank you.

  “ He loved Colonel Gaillard and
watched over his interests as jealously
as a dog. Well, now, is a man who has
had this reputation all his life, a man
whom everybody trusts, very likely to go
off the hook as suddenly as that, and—
with no conceivable motive—brutally
kill the master he has served so faith-
fully?”

  “ It is very possible,” I said, “ that
people were deceived in Mose. I have
been suspicious of him from the moment

I laid eyes 011 him. You may think it
unfair to judge a man from his physical
appearance, but I wish you could once
see Cat-Eye Mose yourself, and you
would know what I mean.

  “ One night he drove Radnor and me
home from a party, and I could actually
see his eyes shining in the dark. It's
the most gruesome thing I ever saw;
and take that on top of his habits—he
carries snakes around in the front of his
shirt—really, one suspects him of any-
thing.”

  “ I hope he isn’t dead,” Jerry mur-
mured wistfully. “ I’d like a personal
interview.”

   He sat sunk down in his chair for sev-
eral minutes, intently examining the end
of his fountain-pen.

   “ H’m,” he said, rousing himself, " it’s
time we had a shy at the ghost.”

  “ Well,” I said, “ the first definite
thing that reached the house was the
night of my arrival when the roast
chicken was stolen. I’ve told you that
in detail.”

  “ And it was that same night that
Aunt What-ever-her-name-is saw the
ghost in the laurel walk?"

  I nodded.

  “ Did she say what it looked like?”

  " It was white.”

  “ And when you searched the cabins
did you go into the one where the grain
is stored? ”

  “ No. Mose dropped his torch at the
entrance. And, anyway, Rad said there
was no use in searching it. It was al-
ready full to the brim with sacks of corn-
rneal.”

  “ Do you think that Radnor was try-
ing to divert you from the scent?”

  “ No, I am sure he hadn't a suspicion
himself.”

  “ And what did the thing look like
that you saw Mose carrying to the cabins
in the night?”

  " It seemed to be a large black bun-
dle. I have thought since that it might
have been clothes or blankets, or some-
thing of that sort.”

  “ So much for the first night,” said
Jerry- “ Now, how soon did the ghost
appear again?”	vv,

  “Various things were stolen after
that, and the servants attributed it to the
ha’nt, but the first direct knowledge I

had was the night of the party, when
Radnor acted so strangely. I told you
of his going back in the night."

  “He was carrying something, too?"

  “ Yes, he had a black bundle—it might
have been clothes.”

  “ And after that he and Mose were
in constant consultation?”

  “ Yes; they both encouraged the be-
lief in the ha’nt among the negroes, and
did their best to keep every one away
from the laurel walk. I overheard Mose
several times telling stories to the other
negroes about the terrible things the
ha’nt would do if he caught them.”

  “ And he himself didn’t show any fear
over the stories?”

  “Not the slightest; appeared rather
to enjoy them.”

  “ And Radnor, how did he take the
matter?"

  “ He was moody and irritable.”

  “ How did you explain the matter to
yourself? ”

  “ I was afraid he had fallen into the
clutches of some one who was threaten-
ing him, possibly levying blackmail.”

  “ But you didn't make any attempt to
discover the truth?”

   “ Well, it was Rad’s own affair, and I
didn’t want the appearance of spying.
I did keep my eyes open as much as I
could.”

   “ And the colonel, how did he take all
this excitement about the ha’nt?”

  “ It bothered him considerably, but
Rad kept him from hearing it as much as
he could.”

  “ When did the ha'nt appear again
after the party? ”

  “ Oh. by that time all sorts of ru-
mors were running about among the
negroes. The whole place was haunted,
and several of the farm-hands had left.
But the next thing that we heard di-
rectly was in the early evening before
the robbery, when Mose, appearing ter-
ribly frightened, said he had seen the
ha'nt rising in a cloud of blue smoke
out of the sink-hole.”

  “ And how did the colonel and Rad-
nor take this?”

  “ The colonel was angry because he
had been bragging about Mose not being
afraid, and Rad was dazed. He didn’t
know what to think; he hustled Mose out
of the way before he could lie questioned.”

  “And what did you think?”

  “ Well, 1 fancied at the time that he
had really seen something, but as I
thought it over in the light of later
events I came to the conclusion that he
was shamming, both then and in the
middle of the night when he roused the
house.”

  “ That is, you wished to think him
shamming, in order to prove his com-
plicity in the robbery and the murder.
And so you twisted the facts to suit your
theory? ”

  “ I don't think you can say that,” I
returned somewhat hotly- " It’s merely
a question of interpreting the facts.”

  “ He didn’t gain much by raising all
that hullabaloo in the middle of the
night.”

  “ Why. yes, that was done in order to
throw suspicion on the ha'nt."

  “Oh. I see!” laughed Jerry. “Well,
now, let’s get to the end of this matter.
Was any more seen of the ha'nt after
that night ? ”

   “ No, at least not’ directly. For five
or six days every one was so taken up
with the robbery that the ha'nt excite-
ment rather died down. Then I believe
there were some rumors among the
negroes, but nothing much reached the
house.”

  “ And since the murder nothing what-
ever has been seen of the ha'nt ? ”

  I shook my head.

  “Just give me a list of the things
that were stolen.”

  “ Well, the roast chicken, a box of
cigars, some shirts off the line, a suit of
Rad’s pajamas, a French novel, some
brandy, quite a lot of things to eat—
fresh loaves of bread, preserves, a boiled
ham. sugar, coffee.

  “ Oh, any amount of stuff; the
negroes simply helped themselves and
laid it to the ha’nt. One of the car-
riages was left out one night, and in
the morning the cushions were gone and
two lap-robes. At the same time a
water-pail was taken and a pair of
Jake’s overalls. And then to end up
came the robbery of the safe.”

  “ The ha'nt had catholic tastes. Any
of the things turned up since?"

   “ Yes. several things, such as blankets
and clothes and dishes have gradually
drifted back."
THE FOUR-POOLS MYSTERY.

671

  " The carriage cushions and lap-robes,
ever find tllem ? ”

  “ Never a trace. And why any one
should want ’em. I don’t know.”

  “What color were the lap-robes?”

  “ Plain black broadcloth.”

  Jerry got up and paced about a few
moments and then came back and sat
down.

  “ One thing is clear," he said, “ there
are two ha’nts.”

  “Two ha’nts! What do you mean?”
“Just what I say. Suppose, for con-
venience, we call them ha’nt number one,
and ha’nt number two. Number one oc-
cupied apartments over the grain bin and
haunted the laurel walk. He was white
—I don’t wonder at that if he spent
much time crawling over those flour
sacks.

  “ He smoked cigars and read French
novels; Mose waited on him and Radnor
knew about him—and didn’t get much
enjoyment out of the knowledge. It
took money to get rid of him—a hundred
dollars down and the promise of more
to come.

  “ Radnor himself drove him off in the
carriage the night he left and Mose
obliterated all traces of his presence. So
much for number one.

  “ As for number two, he appeared
three or four days before the robbery
and haunted pretty much the whole
place, especially the region of the sink-
hole. In appearance he was nine feet
tall, transparent, and black.

  “ Smoke came from his mouth and
blue flames from his eyes. There was a
sulfurous odor about him. He was
first seen rising out of the sink-hole, and
there is a passage in the bottom of the
sink-hole that leads straight down to
Hell. Solomon is my authority.

  “ I asked him how he explained the
apparition, and he reckoned it was the
ghost of the slave who was beaten to
death, and that since his old master had
come back , to haunt the laurel walk, he
had come back to haunt his old master.

  “ That sounds to me like a plausible
explanation. As soon as it’s light I’ll
have a look at the sink-hole.”

  “Jerry,” I said disgustedly, “that
may make a very picturesque newspaper
story, but it doesn't help much in un-
raveling the mystery.”

  “ It helps a good deal. I would not
like to swear to the flames or sulfur or
the passage down to Hell, but the fact
that he was tall and black and comes
from the sink-hole is significant. He
was black—mark that—so were the
stolen lap-robes. ■

  “ Now you see how the matter stands
on the night of the robbery. While
ghost number one was out driving with
Radnor, ghost number two entered the
house through the open library window,
found the safe ajar, and helped himself.

  “ Let’s consider what he took—five
thousand dollars in government bonds,
two deeds, an insurance policy, and a
quart of small change—a very suggestive
lot of loot if you think about it enough.

  “ After the robbery he disappeared,
nothing seen of him for five or six days;
then he turned up again for a day or
so, and finally disappeared forever. So
much for ha’nt number two.

  •	“ He’s the party we’re after. He cer-
tainly robbed the safe and he possibly
committed the murder; as to that I won’t
have any proof until I see the cave.”

  He stretched his arms with a laugh.

  “ Oh, this isn’t so bad. All we've
got to do now is to identify those two
ghosts.”

  “ I’m glad if you think it’s so easy,”
I said somewhat sullenly. “ But I will
tell you one thing, if you go to basing
any deductions on Solomon’s stories
you’ll find yourself bumping against a
stone wall.”

  “ We’ll have Rad over to dinner with
us to-morrow night,” Jerry declared.

  He rose and pulled out his watch.

  “ It’s a quarter before ten. I think it’s
time you went to bed. You look about
played out. You haven’t been sleeping
much of late?”

  “ No, I can’t say that I have."

  “ I ought to have come down at once,”
said Jerry, “ but I'm always so blamed
afraid of hurting people’s feelings.”

  I stared slightly. I had never consid-
ered that one of Jerry’s weak points, but
as he seemed to be quite in earnest, I
let the remark pass.

  “ Do you think I could wake up one
of the stablemen and get him to drive
me to the village? I know it’s pretty
late, but I’ve got to send a couple of
telegrams.”
672	THE ALL-STORY MAGAZINE.

  “Telegrams?” I demanded. “Where
to?”

  Jem' laughed.

  “ Well. I must send a word to the
Post-Despatch to the effect that the
Luray mystery grows more mysterious
every hour. That the police have been
wasting their energies on the wrong
scent, but that the Post-Despatch’s spe-
cial correspondent lias arrived on the
scene, and that we may accordingly look
for a speedy solution.”-

  “What is the second one?” Tasked.
“ To your friend, the police commis-
sioner of Seattle.

  “ You don’t think that Jeff-”

  “ My dear fellow, I don’t think any-
thing unless I have some facts to think
about. Don’t look so nervous; I’m not
accusing him of anything. I merely want
more details than you got; I’m a news-
paper man, remember, and I like local
color even in telegrams.

  “ And now, go to bed; and for Heav-
en’s sake, go to sleep. The case is in
the hands of the Post-Despatch’s young
man and you needn't worry any more.”

CHAPTER XVIII.

JERRY FINDS THE BONDS.

   I was wakened the next morning by
Jerry clumping into my room dressed in
riding-breeches and boots freshly spat-
tered with mud. They were Radnor’s
clothes. Jerry had taken me at my word
and was thoroughly at home.

   “ Hello, old man! ” he said, sitting on
the edge of the bed. “ Been asleep,
haven’t you? Sorry to wake you, but
we’ve got a day’s work ahead. Hope
you don't mind my borrowing Radnor’s
togs. I didn't come down prepared for
riding.

  “ Solomon gave ’em to me; seemed to
think that Rad wouldn’t need ’em any
more. Oh, Solomon and I are great
friends," he added, with a laugh, as he
suddenly appeared to remember the ob-
ject of his visit and commenced a search
through his pockets.

   I sat up in bed and watched him im-
patiently. It was evident that he had
some news and also that he was going
to be as leisurely as possible about im-
parting it.

  “ This is a pretty country,” he re-
marked as he finished with his coat-
pockets and commenced on the waist-
coat. “ It would be almost worth living
in if many little affairs like this occurred
to keep things going.”

  "Really, Jerry-," I cried, “when you
refer to my uncle’s murder as a ‘ little
affair' I think you're going too far.”

  “ Oh, I beg your pardon," said Jerry
good-naturedly, “ I guess I am incor-
rigible. I didn’t know Colonel Gaillard
personally, you see, and I’m so used to
murders that I’ve come to think it’s the
only natural way of dying.

  “ Anyhow,” he added, as he finally
produced a yellow envelope, “ I've got
something here that will interest you. It
explains why our young friend Radnor
didn’t want to talk.”

  He tossed the envelope on the bed and
I eagerly tore out the telegram. It was
from the police commissioner in Seattle,
and it said:

    Jefferson Gaillard returned Seattle
  May seventh, after six weeks absence.
  Said to have visited old home, Virginia.
  Appeared to be in funds.

  “ What does it mean ? ” 1 asked.

  “It means.” said Jerry, “that we’ve
spotted ghost number one. It was clear
from the first that Radnor was trying to
shield some one, even at the expense of
his own reputation. That narrowed our
search considerably. Leaving women out
of the case it pointed pretty straight to-
ward his elder brother.

  “ So much of your theory was correct,
the only trouble was that you carried it
too far; you made him commit both the
robbery and the murder. Then when
you found a part of your theory broke
down you rejected the whole of it.

  “ You see how the matter stood. Teff
Gaillard was pretty desperately in need
of money. Probably the debt was not
entirely honest; may have been misap-
propriating funds or something of that
sort. Seattle too hot to hold him and he
lit out and came East.

  “ He applied to Radnor, but Radnor
was in a tight place himself and couldn’t
lay his hands on anything, except what
his father had given him for a birthday
present. That was tied up in another
investment and if he converted it into
THE FOUR-POOLS MYSTERY.	673

cash it would be at a sacrifice. So it
ran along for a week or so, while Rad
was casting about for a means of get-
ting his brother out of the way without
any fresh scandal.

  “ But Mose’s suddenly taking to see-
ing ha’nts precipitated matters. Realiz-
ing that his father’s patience had reached
its limit and that he couldn’t keep you
off the scent much longer, he determined
to borrow the money for Jeff’s journey
back to Seattle, and to close up his own
investment.

  “ That same night he drove Jeff to
the station at Kennisburg ; the Washing-
ton Express does not stop at Lambert
Junction, and. anyway. Kennisburg is a
bigger station and travelers excite less
comment. This isn't deduction : it’s fact.

I	rode to Kennisburg this morning and
proved it.

  “ The station-man remembers selling
Radnor Gaillard a ticket to Washington
in the middle of the night about three
weeks ago. Some anan. who waited out-
side and whose face the agent did not"
see, boarded the train, and Rad drove
off home alone. The ticket-seller does
not know Rad personally, but lie says
that he knows him by sight. So much
for that.

  “ Rad came home and went to bed.
When he came down-stairs in the morn-
ing he was met by the information that
the ha’nt had robbed the safe. You can
see what instantly jumped into his mind
—some way. somehow. Jeff had taken
those bonds—and yet figure on it as he
might, he could not see how it was pos-
sible.

  " The robbery seemed to have occurred
while he was away. Could Jeff merely
have pretended to leave? Might he in
some way have got back? Those are the
questions that were bothering Radnor.
He v»jis honest in saying that he could
not imagine how the bonds had been
stolen, and yet he was also honest in not
wanting to know the truth.”

  “ He might have confided in me,” 1
said.

  “ It would have been a good deal
wiser for him to do so. But in order to
understand Rad's point of view, you
must take into account Jeff’s character.
He appears to have been a reckless,
dashing, headstrong but exceedingly at-

     7	S

tractive fellow. His father put up with
his excesses for six years before the final
quarrel.

  “ Cat-Eye Mose. so old Jake tells me,
moped for months after his disappear-
ance. Rad, as a little fellow, wor-
shiped his bad but charming brother.
There you have it. Jeff turns up again
with a hard-luck story, and Mose and
Radnor both go back to their old allegi-
ance. He wants his presence kept a
secret, and they do so.

  “ After the robbery Radnor is too sick
at the thought that Jeff may have be-
trayed him to want to do anything but
hush the matter up. At the news of
the murder he does not know what to
think; he will not believe Jeff guilty,
and yet lie does not see anv other wav
out.”

  Jerry paused a moment and leaned
forward with an excited gleam in his
eye.

  “ That,” he said. “ is the whole truth
about ghost number one. Our business
now is to track down ghost number two,
and here, as a starter, are the missing
bonds.”

  He tossed a pile of mildewed papers
on the bed, and met my astonishment
with a triumphant chuckle.

  It was true. All live of the missing
bonds were there, the May first coupons
still uncut;. also the deeds and insurance
policy just as they had left the safe, ex-
cept that they were damp and mud-
stained.

  I	stared for a moment, too amazed to
speak.

  “Good Heavens, Jerry! Where did
you find them?” I gasped at last.

  Jerry shrugged his shoulders with a
tantalizing laugh.

  “ Exactly where I thought I'd find
them. Oh, I’ve been out early this
morning! I saw the sun rise and break-
fasted in Kennisburg about six-forty-
five. I'm ready for another breakfast,
though.

  “ Hurry up and get dressed; we’ve
got a day’s work before us. I'm off to
the stables to talk ‘ horses' with U ncle
Jake; when you’re ready for breakfast
send Solomon after me.”

  “ Jerry,” I implored, “ where on the
face of the earth did you find those
bonds ? "

THE BURGLARY OF SANDMOUTH.

By Walter E. Grogan.

  who aims to chtat others
  must watch out that he is
  not hoist with his own petard.

THE little town of Sandmouth was
in a state of extreme excitement
For weeks it had panted for
something to break the monotony
of the dull months preceding the summer
season. Now it had come with a venge-
ance!

  The shop belonging to Mr. William
Jarvis had been broken into and jewelry
abstracted. In the first glow of enthusi-
asm, reports vaulted high as to the prob-
able loss. Thousands were mentioned,
tens of thousands hinted at. A jeweler’s
shop, the principal jeweler’s shop of a
prosperous east-coast seaside resort, looms
large in local eyes as a Golconda of
wealth. And in front of the season, just
when the new stock was laid in and the
bills of the Summer Season Sale already
printed!

  Some one early in the forenoon haz-
arded that the work was the work of a
person who knew Sandmouth and knew
Jarvis. The remark created consterna-
tion.

  “ And him in the town yesterday,” said
Owen Jones, a draper, breaking the si-
lence fallen cloud-like upon the office of
the Ring o’ Bells.

  Mr. William Jarvis was a little gray-
haired man. with a hard mouth and a
determined chin. His little black eyes,
deep set. looked out from undeiistraggly
gray brows in a challenging fashion. He
was a close man—close-fisted, close-
hearted, close-mouthed. Sandmouth paid
him the deference due to his position,

bought its rings and trinkets at his shop,
but did not love him.

  He was a hectoring man. and bullied
his fellow members upon the Council;
and. like all great men in little places,
he was absurdly jealous.

  The jeweler had a daughter—Emily
Jarvis. Some people held that that was
his one redeeming point; others regarded
her as the chief jewel in his shop.

  In reality she was just such a pretty,
laughing, healthy, lovable girl as en-
couraged extravagance in compliment.
She helped in the shop, and made out
the bills in the neatest of handwriting,
biting her penholder with her pearly
teeth and shaking her curls in despair
when she had to compute two and a half
per cent discount.

  Being a close man and a good business
man. William Jarvis was well aware of
the value of Em. Visitors were known
to buy dozens of his Sandmouth “ Sou-
venir Spoon.” one at a time, merely for
the pleasure of looking at her. And so.
being aware of her business value. Will-
iam Jarvis regarded all efforts on the
part of young bachelor tradesmen to
transfer her attraction to their own shops
with a jaundiced eve. Not even the case
of expensive engagement-rings was more
safely 3nd jealously guarded than Em.

  She was luckily of a happy disposition,
and little tempted to rebel. ’.She laughed
her way light-heartedly enough until
a few months previous to the Sandmouth
Sensation. That was a month after the
engagement of a new assistant.

  His name was Charles Gower, a dark-
haired. handsome young giant, whose
advent changed the fortunes of the
Sandmouth Football Club. Hitherto.
William Jarvis had eschewed handsome
assistants. Gower’s remarkable indiffer-

ence as to wages tempted him, and he
succumbed, not without twinges of un-
easiness; yet the new employee proved
an admirable salesman, business was
brisker than it had ever been before dur-
ing the dull season, and old Jarvis kept
him longer than his better judgment
suggested.

  He argued that if he remained in the
shop with his daughter and young Gower
as much as possible nothing in the way
of love-making could happen.

  Which wps unworthy of his wisdom.

  One day William Jarvis discovered
something—a kiss, a note, possibly only
a look, for old Jarvis could be sharp.
Em's manner had rendered him sus-
picious. She had become self-conscious
and given to sudden flushings, to odd
moods, to tears unaccountably, and to
smiles quite as unaccountably as the tears.

  The interview that followed—between
William Jarvis and his assistant—in the
glass-fronted room leading out of the
shop where the old man had his repair-
ing-bench was brief, but unpleasant.

  “ She’s none for you! ” snapped the
old man finally.

  “ Em loves me,” protested Charles
manfully. “I have a good trade, and you
know as well as I do that I work well.”

   “ You are only an assistant.”

   11	I can rise.”

  "Not in my shop. I won’t have it!
My girl is mine, and I keep her. D’ you
see? Look at my position. I’m a coun-
cilor—you're an assistant, nothing more.”

  “ You're afraid if I married her as
you'd lose some custom! ” Charles cried
unwisely.

3 The accusation was near enough to the
truth to anger the old man exceedingly.
Set in plain words, it sounded terribly
selfish.

  “ You’re an impudent rascal! 1 f you
were Em’s only chance, you shouldn't
have her! ” The old man raised his
voice.

  “Why?” demanded the young man.

   “ Because I don't like you personally,
nor your ways, nor your deeds. I was
going to give you the sack on Friday,
before ever I caught you at your under-
hand dealings with my daughter.”

  “ I kept it secret because Em would
have it so. She was afraid of you. Why
were you going to give me the sack? ”

  The old man, hot with anger, cudgeled
his brains for a reply. Lie had lied, and
he must substantiate his lie. Suddenly
a suggestion came into his brain that
made him smile in an ugly fashion.

  11	There's been some things missing,
and cash.”

  The young man took a step forward.
Every vestige of color had deserted his
face, his eyes blazed.

  " What do you mc-an, Mr. Jarvis?"

  " I mean nothing,” said the old man
steadily, not flinching. “ I have missed
things, and I was going to get rid of
you.”

  “Do you accuse me?” Charles de-
manded.

  “ No. I have no proof. But you’d
better go to-night.”

  . “ You are trying to blacken my charac-
ter in a cowardly way! If you were
not Em’s father you should answer for
this! ”

  “ Aye, bluster—that’s the way. I’ve
got no proof, I tell you; you're safe
enough. But you stay no longer in my
shop.”

  The wrangle ran on for a few minutes
longer, and then Charles flung out of the
inner room. Emily, who was in the shop,
trembling at the sound of the angry
voices, came to his side.

  “ Stand away, Em ! ” cried her father.
“ You shall have nothing to do with him.

I	have discharged him.”

  “ I love him.” Em answered fearlessly.

  “You shall not!" her father thun-
dered.

  “ When the time is ripe I shall come
for her,” said Charles, “ and she will
go with me. Nothing that you say will
stop her. That is so, sweetheart, is it
not?"

  " That is so, Charles," she answered.

  “ A pauper—and worse! ” sneered old
Jarvis. “ Be off before I turn you out! ”

  " I shall not always be a pauper, and
be assured I shall come one day for
Emily."

  With that, Charles Gower turned on
his heel and quitted the shop, and three
hours l^ter quitted the town of Sand-
mouth.

  Old William Jarvis hinted industri-
ously that his last. assistant had been
dishonest, and some believed him, but
the many did not.
676

THE A LI.-STORY MAGAZINE.

  Emily grew sad and pale. Whether
she heard from Charles no one knew.
Her father said no word to her about
her lover after the day on which he dis-
missed him. But in his heart he knew
that whenever Charles Gower came for
her she would go. Hatred of the man
who had made him lie grew fiercer even
than his desire to keep the attraction of
his daughter in his shop.

  Another assistant, an elderly man with
a gaunt figure and long hair, was en-
gaged; and the broken love-story was
three months old when, right in front
of the summer season, came the sensa-
tional news that William Jarvis's shop
had been robbed.

  The house, a three-storied building in
the main street, had a small back yard,
with a door in the wall leading into a
lane used for the discharge of merchan-
dise to other shops. The whole of the
ground floor was given over to the jew-
eler's business. The iron-shuttered shop
came first, then the little windowed room
looking into the shop where Mr. Jarvis
had his bench, and at the back a
workshop.

  The door leading into the back yard
was bolted inside at night besides being
locked. In this workshop slept a fox-
terrier, an admirable house-dog. The
upper part of the house composed the
living-rooms.

  On the morning of the burglary Will-
iam Jarvis came down to find the back-
door bolt cut out. evidently by a chisel,
and the door unlocked. A hasty glance
around the shop discovered the fact that
a case of gold watches and a tray of plain
gold wedding and chased keeper rings
were empty. Mr. Jarvis opened the
door of the shop and called a police-
man.

  This was a little after seven in the
morning.

  The constable entered the shop, looked
around, and gave his opinion that there
had been a burglary. Examining the
iron shutters, which were still up, and
the front door, he added that an entrance
must have been made from the rear.

  As the bolt of the back door had
been bodily cut out, this surmise did not
impress Mr. Jarvis. Sergeant Wynn
passing the door, was immediately sum-
moned by the constable, who scratched

his head in thankful relief at so quickly
transferring the responsibility of inves-
tigation.

  Sergeant Wynn made a morevor less
intelligent examination. The dog who
barked at him when he entered the work-
shop puzzled him greatly.

  11	There’s no doubt the house has been
entered from the lane, Mr. Jarvis,” he
said. “ The door into the lane was
scaled. It's easy enough for a tall man.
There are scratches all the way up. as
if the man's boots hit against it in pulling
himself up. It rained yesterday, and the
back yard must have been soaking wet.
There are footmarks just inside the back
door into the house. They will be use-
ful. I've taken down the measurements.
Whoever did it knew the place, for he's
cut out the bolt exactly. But I don’t
understand the dog being quiet. Didn’t
you hear him, Mr. Jarvis? ”

    Heard nothing, knew nothing, until
I came down. Tim's a good house-dog—
would have been sure to bark unless he
knew the step and liked the man."

  “ Unless he knew the step! ” Sergeant
Wynn caught him up briskly. “ There
you are! Some one who knows the dog
and knew exactly where the bolt was,
and has been able to take impressions of
the keys. Do you suspect any one?”

  “ No,” said Mr. Jarvis slowly. He
thought a while, and then repeated.
“ No.”

  “ Ah ! ” commented the sergeant, look-
ing wise. " We’ve both got bur thoughts,
sir. I’ll leave the constable here and
look around. I must report to the su-
perintendent when he comes in from Ox-
ter.”

  Exactly at twelve o'clock Sandmouth
received another shock. Sergeant Wynn
walked down High Street with his hand
on Charles Gower’s shoulder! And
they disappeared in the direction of the
police station.

  At two o’clock public opinion shook
its head over Charles Gower. Things
looked very black against him. Tim, the
dog. was known to be very fond of him.
and who could know better than he the
exact position of the bolt or have greater
facilities for taking impressions of the
keys? A clever workman, too, al-
ways making something in the smith-
ing line!
THE BURGLARY OF SANDMOUTH.

  The only keys never in his possession
were the keys of the safe, and the safe
had not been tampered with. Three or
four volunteers had come forward as-
serting that they saw him loitering in
the lane behind the shop quite late at
night. He had refused to say where he
had been the previous evening, although
the landlady of the little inn where he
had put up for the night declared that
he did not return until three in the
morning.

  And, most damning of all facts, the
muddy footmarks discovered by the ser-
geant were found to fit his boots so ex-
actly that no doubt at all could be en-
tertained that they were liis! Public
opinion held that matters looked uncom-
monly black for Charles Gower.

  Emily refused to believe that Charles
was guilty. He was incapable of
theft, she asserted; he was the truest,
most honorable, man ever known by
Sandmouth, or the rest of the world to
boot. Mr. William Jarvis looked at her
sadly, then gravely shook his head over
the outburst. She had just heard the
news of her lover’s arrest—a fact hither-
to withheld from her by the forethought
of her father.

  In the shop stood the superintendent
of police, a thin, alert, military-looking
man. Behind him was the sergeant.

   “ Fie was seen outside, at the back, late
last night,” Mr. Jarvis said slowly. “ He
returned to his room at three, and he re-
fuses to account for his time except that
he was up on the cliff—a likely story! ”

  “ You are cruel, father! ” Emily cried.
Her head was thrown back, her eyes were
defiant, more especially defiant of the
superintendent, who smiled lazily. “ He
refused to account for his movements
in order to shield me. There, it’s out,
and I don't care who knows it! He
came here last night to see me. That
was after twelve—at night. Let me
speak, father. It’s true.

  “ I waited until you were asleep, and
crept down and opened the doors, the
back door and the door into the lane.
It was raining, and he stood just inside
the door. He wanted me to elope with
him. He knew that it was hopeless to
get your consent. I knew that also. I
stood out for some time. Then I con-
sented.”

  Mr. William Jarvis shook his head
again very sadly.

    The "folly of girls bewitched by a
good-looking scamp. She is trying to
shield him, Mr. Andrews,” he said, ad-
dressing the superintendent with a rising
note in his voice, as if anger were be-
ginning to whip him. “Did she go?
She was going to elope; she didn't.
Why? Because there is no truth in her
tale."

  “ Because my door was locked. I was
to steal out in ail hour and meet him
on the cliff. I had to put my things
together in a bag—there was some of
my mother’s jewelry—I wanted that.
W hen I came to open my door, it was
locked.”

  “ Yes,” said Mr. Jarvis. " I locked
it—I locked it at half past eleven, when
I went to bed. The servant found it
locked this morning. I saw Gower
sneaking about the shop-door yesterday,
so I locked you in to make sure. I told
the sergeant so this morning. He can
bear me out; the servant can bear ms
out.”

  “ Oh, father, you are lying away my
happiness! ” Emily cried out. “ It
wasn’t Charles; he couldn’t do such a
thing! I know he is innocent—and I’ll
marry him in spite of anything! ”

  “ F wouldn’t say anything more, miss,”
said the sergeant, in a fatherly manner;
“ it may hurt your young man.”

  Mr. Andrews, the superintendent,
looked up and smiled.

  “ I’ll just go over the house, Mr. Jar-
vis, although the case seems fairly clear,”
he said. “ Neat steps, those of yours—
for reaching the top shelves, I suppose? ”

  “ Yes,” growled Mr. Jarvis.

  " Only used in the shop ? ”

  “ Only used in the shop,” assented Mr,
Jarvis. " Not strong enough for rough
work.”

  Mr. Andrews was gone half an hour,
during which, at his request, Mr. Jarvis
remained in the shop “ to look after his
daughter," as the superintendent sug-
gested. Emily sat staring before her,
weeping quietly from time to time.

  Both turned at the sound of the su-
perintendent’s entrance, both perhaps a
little relieved. Mr. Andrews was still
smiling softly.

^“A careless man, the thief, Mr. Jar-

vis," he said—“ a very careless man. I
am glad you had nothing disturbed. It
has made investigation very easy. The
case is quite clear new."

  “Quite clear?" repeated Mr. Jarvis,
a little uncertainly.

  “ It is hardly a case of theft, hut of
paltry revenge,” the superintendent con-
tinued.

  “ Revenge! The scamp had some rea-
son for revenge, perhaps, but theft is
theft, whatever the reason."

  I'he superintendent nodded, and his
smile deepened.

  “Of course, the behavior of your dog
gave the first clue."

  He was good to the dog, I admit
that," said Mr. Jarvis.

  “ Then the knowledge of the exact

position of the bolt-”

  “ Quite so,” Mr. Jarvis agreed eagerly.
“ Are you insured against burglary,
Mr. Jarvis? "

  •• No—no. It's a dead loss to me.
The rates are so high I never insure.”
“Not a dead loss. I've found the
missing articles.”

  “ What! ” screamed Mr. Jarvis. Then
he mopped his forehead and stared at
Mr. Andrews open-mouthed.

  “ At least, I know where to find them.
They are in the box-room, up in your
pent-roof.”

  Mr. Jarvis tried to speak, but failed.

  “ It was a paltry thing to do, Mr.
Jarvis.” said the superintendent severely.
“A mean, contemptible thing. If you
had succeeded you would have had a
man’s ruin on your conscience. Thank
God earnestly that you did not succeed.”
“What—what do you mean?" Mr.
Jarvis, suddenly looking very old. said
lamely.

  “ Last night you were disturbed, and

coming down-stairs, found your daugh-
ter talking to Charles Gower. Instead
of confronting them, you listened, and
as you listened you hatched a horrible
plot to ruin a young man.

  “ When your daughter returned to her
room you locked her in. Then you came
down-stairs and cut out that bolt with
a chisel. There's a heap of chips in-
side—it is palpable that it was cut out
from the inside, 110 doubt for the con-
venience of the light. But it was care-
less. You ought to have used a lantern.
I’hen you took the steps from the shop
outside into the lane, caught hold of
the top of the wall, and scratched marks
with your boots.

  “ There were mud-stains oq the legs
of the steps, and you must have knocked
against the back door bringing them in.
for there is a new scratch on the door and
traces of paint on the top of the steps.
Then you took the jewelry up to the box-
room, which, is, I discovered, rarely used.

  “ The dust has been newly disturbed
on the short ladder going up to it. and
the trap-door has been recently opened.
A pair of goloshes, still damp, explained
why your feet left no mud-stains. The
worst of it, Mr. Jarvis, is that I do not
set how 1 can arrest you for stealing
your own property.”

  Mr. Jarvis struggled to his feet and
glared wildly.

  " So—so you’ve found out! ” he cried.
“ Well. I’m—I’m not sorry. It was a
sudden—a sudden temptation. And now
—oh, God, I’m glad—I’m glad!”

  At thi. point Mr. Jarvis collapsed in
a fainting condition.

  Mr. and Mrs. Charles Gower have now
a prosperous business in Oxter, and Mr.
Jarvis is by no means the hard man he
was.

THE BIRTH OF SPRING.

 By Emma C. Dowd.

ALL night the sobbing wind kept pace
With the sad rain's unmeasured tramp;
All night on Nature's patient face
Gleamed lightning's weird anti fitful lamp.

But sunbeams rent the clouds in twain;

A soft breeze kissed the expectant morn;
A bluebird sang a witching strain;

A crocus bloomed—and Spring was born.
 CHASE OF THE GLADSTONE BAG."

By Louis Joseph Vance.

Because of which an American in London gets himself entangled
in many adventures.

SYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS CHAPTERS.

IN the dining-room of the Hotel Pless, London, Philip Kirkwood, San Franciscan, and
now pauper because of the earthquake, becomes interested in a young girl at a table
near by. He sees her escort receive a note from a woman. Much perturbed by this note,
the man approaches Kirkwood, introduces himself as Mr. Calendar, and asks him to escort
his daughter home; thereupon he disappears, and Kirkwood and Miss Calendar drive to
a dismal house, where Kirkwood is dismissed with thanks.

    Fearing for the girl's safety, he returns to the house, forces an entrance, has a struggle
in the dark with a man whom he finally overcomes, finds Miss Calendar, and escapes
with her. She, carrying a mysterious gladstone bag, wishes to be driven to a Mrs. Hal-
lam's to meet her father. Learning she has never met Mrs. Hallam. Kirkwood suggests
his going in to see if Calendar is there. He does so.-leaving the girl in the cab. Mrs.
Hallam, the woman with the note, tells him that Calendar is not there, and insists that
Miss Calendar come in and wait. Kirkwood goes to get her. but the cab has disappeared.

   Calendar, arriving shortly and suspecting that his ''pal" Mulready has gone with
Dorothy Calendar and the bag (the true object of solicitude), hurries with Kirkwood to a
Thames landing, where he catches them about to be rowed out to the Alethea, evidently
some ship. He joins them, and Kirkwood is deserted.

    Kirkwood finds himself penniless, having lost his purse in die dismal house. Returning
thither for it, he encounters the still unconscious man with whom he struggled. While
trying to revive him, he is surprised by Mrs. Hallam. She claims the stunned man is her
son; that the bag contains jewels, hers by inheritance, and that she is being robbed by
Mulready and Calendar, who are crooks. Though Kirkwood doubts her integrity, he
decides that Dorothy is in the hands of scoundrels and that he will assist her. __

    He at once goes to find the Alethea. After rowing around the shipping on the i names,
he takes a railway journey, wherein Mrs. Hallam is again encountered, but evaded. He
gets a catboat surreptitiously, and, regardless of life, sets out to run down the Alethea.
This he practically does, only to find die Calendar party not aboard of her, and after
being-robbed by her captain, is landed in Antwerp, without a cent.

    He sees Mrs. Hallam arrive and take a cab, which he follows until it stops before a
cheap water-front hotel. Mrs. Hallam watches patiently from the cab-window until Mul-
ready and Calendar emerge from the hotel and make for the wharves. Kirkwood, losing
interest in the lady, follows the men, and seeing them put out for the Alethea, which is
anchored near by, does likewise. On the ship he watches them hide the gladstone bag. and
then with the effrontery of a pirate enters the cabin, holds them up: locks them in a s'iatc-
room. and with the bag returns to shore and goes to the hotel where he surmises Dorothy
is. He goes up to her room, and is met by Mrs. Hallam. who is persuading the girl to go
with her, but finally, after threatening to expose the lady, succeeds in getting the gir; tu

  For a time they laughed and chatted,
pretending fiutt all was well with them.
I'hen the gir:. nestling her head in a
corner of the dingy cushions, smiled
drowsily upon Kirkwood through her
drooping lashes, and slept, a soft color
ebbing and Hewing in her cheeks, the
shadow of a sleepy smile quivering about
the sensitive scarlet lips, the wind
through the open window working won-
ders with the sunlit glory of her hair.

  Dunkirk halted their progress, and
they changed cars — the ubiquitous
Hobbs a hateful shadow in the distance.
Calais they reached in the middle of the
forenoon, "with a three-hour wait con-
fronting them before the departure of
the Dover packet.

  An anxious time—doubly anxious to
Kirkwood, both Itecause of Hobbs the
persistent and for that reason which he
had kept secret from the girl, lest she
should grieve needlessly. Time enough
to agitate her on that head when he had
reached the absolute limit of his re-
sources.

  Moreover, between Dunkirk and Ca-
lais they had decided upon a plan of
action involving a temporary separation,
with all its attendant perils. Neither
could forget that Calendar might be in
Calais; presuming that Hobbs had
reached him by wire, he could readily
have anticipated their arrival, whether
by sea. in the brigantine, or by land—
the direct route via Brussels and Lille.

If they were unhappily to meet him-

Neither cared to contemplate the possi-
bilities involved in such a denouement.

  When they left the train at the (jure
Centrale. Kirkwood's satchel held only
a majority of the girl's belongings,
which had been transferred from her own
traveling-bag to make room for the
gladstone. Further, he had armed her
with one of the revolvers.

  Disregarding the importunities of the
cabmen, they passed through the depot
and into the quiet streets of the seaport.
Hobbs hovering anxiously in the offing;
then, at a deserted corner, they separated,
the girl turning quickly out of sight to
make her way to the Terminus Hotel.
Kirkwood swinging sharply to deal with
the disturbed Mr. Hobbs.

  When this maneuver was executed the
mate was in the middle of the block. As

Kirkwood moved toward him purposeful-
ly he stopped short and initiated a swift
flanking movement across-street. Kirk-
wood, hot with righteous wrath, proved
too quick for the cockney: on reaching
the farther sidewalk. Hobbs was dis-
gusted to find their relative positions
unchanged, save that possibly Kirkwood
had drawn a little closer.

   Abruptly the mate took to his heels.
Kirkwood, satisfied, pursued until con-
vinced that Hobbs could not pick up the
trail again; then hailed a fiacre and load
himself driven to the American Consul-
ate.

   Some time later, crimson and smart-
ing with shame and humiliation, he
made a quick exit from the consulate
doors, leaving an amused official repre-
sentative of his country’s government
with the impression of having been en-
tertained to the point of boredom for
half an hour by an exceptionally clumsy
but persistent liar.

  And Hobbs was strolling down the
street, over the way. kicking up his heels
and whistling an air maudlin with senti-
ment.

  Kirkwood paid him no further heed
whatsoever, hopelessly abandoning the
attempt to shake him off. resigned to a
future wherein the obnoxious little Lon-
doner should form a component part of
the landscape wherever one turned one's
eye. Besides, grim care was now setting
the pace for him in deadly earnest.

  By noon the suspense had grown too
great for endurance, and Kirkwood,
throwing caution and their understand-
ing to the winds, proceeded directly for
the hotel at the Gare Maritime, and sent
up his name to Miss Calendar.

   The girl met him in the public lounge
(bringing with her the traveling-bag).
looking marvelously refreshed by her
ninety minutes of complete repose and
privacy. Kirkwood, on the contrary,
was so fagged and distraught that at
the sight of his care-worn countenance
she hurried to him with a low, pitying
cry.

   “ Oh. nothing new,” he told her. with
a sorry ghost of a grin; “ only there are
no signs of Mr. Calendar, and I knew
you had to have something to eat."

   They were lingering over dejeuner a
hi fourchettc (and feeling somewhat

better), when word was brought to them
that the steamer was 011 the point of
sailing.

^Outwardly composed but inwardly in
a tremor, they boarded the packet, meet-
ing with 110 misadventure whatsoever—
if one excepts the circumstance that
when the hotel and restaurant bills were
settled and through tickets to London
bought Kirkwood found himself in pos-
session of precisely one franc and
twenty centimes.

  If only he had not been so anxious to
give Calendar full value for his money!

  As the boat drew out from the pier
Mr. Hobbs was to be seen waving Mr.
Kirkwood an ironic farewell and vio-
lently blowing kisses to Miss Calendar
from the tips of his soiled fingers.

  At the first blush, by turns indignant
and relieved to see the last of him, Kirk-'
wood fell subsequently a prey to pro-
phetic terrors.

  Hobbs’s relinquishment of the chase
could mean but one thing—that, far
from having left danger behind them on
the Continent, they were but flying to
encounter it beneath the smoky pall of
London.

CHAPTER XXL

THE COILS TIGHTEN.

  The westering sun striking down
through the drab exhalations of ten
thousand sooty chimneypots tinted the
atmosphere to the hue of copper.

  One’s gaze, wandering purposely out
through the window, recoiled, repelled
by the endless dreary vista of the
Surrey Side’s uncounted roofs; or,
probing instantaneously the depths of
some narrow thoroughfare, fleetingly
disclosed as the evening boat-train swung
on level with the eaves of Southwark’s
dwellings, was saddened by the knowl-
edge that such squalor could obtain and
flourish unrebuked.

  For perhaps the tenth time. Kirkwood
turned to the girl with the question
ready-framed upon his lips.

  “ Are you quite sure-” he began,

and then, conscious of the clear and
penetrating perception of the brown eyes
that smiled into his from beneath their
level brows, stammered and left the sen-
tence uncompleted.

  Still regarding him steadily, smiling,
the girl shook her head in laughing re-
buke and denial.

  “ Do you know,’’ she asked him,
“ that that is about the fifth repetition
within the last quarter-hour of that ques-
tion? "

  “ How do you know what I meant to
say? ” he demanded, momentarily di-
verted.

  “ I could see it in your eyes. Besides,
you’ve talked of nothing else since we
left the boat. Won’t you believe me.
please, when I tell you that 1 know ab-
solutely not a soul in London to whom
I could go and ask for shelter?

  “ It’s only a little way farther, Mr.
Kirkwood, to Chiltern—an hour’s ride;
and the Pyrfords will be glad to have
me. So, you see. by eight to-night you’ll
have off your hands the girl who has
been nothing but a drag and a worry to
you ever since-”

  “ Don’t! ” he pleaded. “ Please!

■* “ You know,” he told her, with his
heart in his eyes, “ that it isn’t that. I
don’t want you off my hands—that is to
say, I—er-”

  And he fell speechless, aghast at the
enormity of his blunder.

  “ I mean,” he said presently, control-
ling his voice, “ that I should be glad to
go on serving you howsoever I might
until the end of time.”

  Here he came to a full stop.

    Oh, Lord ! ” he groaned. “ Worse
and more of it! Why in thunder can't I
say the right thing right!”

  The problem absorbing him for the
time, he hardly noticed that she made
110 answer. The train grinding and jolt-
ing to a halt before crossing the bridge
presently roused him.

  She. was staring thoughtfully out of
the window, out over a billowing sea of
roofs and chimneys merging indefinitely
into haze long ere it reached the horizon;
and he could see the warm color pulsing
in her throat and cheeks, while the
glamour of the light that leaped and
died in her eyes as the ruddy sunlight
wanned them was a thing to live for and
die for.

  So she had understood !

  Suddenly she turned to him, sweet,
troubled, serious.

  “ Dear Mr. Kirkwood." she said
082

THE ALL-STORY MAGAZINE.

gently, leaning forward to read his
anxious countenance, “ won’t you tell me
what it is that worries you so? Is it the
fear xtf my father? Don’t you know that
he can do nothing, now that we are safe?
All we have to do is to jump in a cab
and drive over to Paddington Station.'

  “ You don't want to underestimate
the resource and ability of Mr. Calen-
dar,” he told her gloomily. " We’ve a

chance, but no more. It wasn't-

He shut up suddenly.

  “ It wasn't that? ” she caught him up.
"Then what is it? You must tell me,
vou know, if it affects me."

  “ It affects us both.” he said drearily.
“ I—I don't-■"

  And there again the wretched embar-
rassment of the confession struck him
dumb ; only his eyes appealed to hers,
mutely piteous.

  The train began to move.

  “ There's only a minute moTe.” the
girl told him. " Surely you can tell
me."

  “ It's this.” he broke out. exasperated;
“ I'm strapped. I haven't enough to pay
cab-fare across town, to say nothing of
taking us to Chiltern. 1 haven’t enough
money to buy you a glass of water if you
were thirsty! ”

  Dismay flickered in her eyes—dismay
and sympathy and all the emotions such
a confession should naturally rouse in
one who, like Dorothy Calendar, had
never given money a thought, had never
known the want of a penny.

  “ And.” she added presently, in a
breathless, awestruck tone. “ I haven't a
farthing in the world! I never even
thought of it. Poor Mr. Kirkwood! I
am so sorry! Let me see; what can 1
do? 1 can't consent to be a burden.”
But you're not. There’s one thing
we can do, of course." She glanced at
him inquiringly. “ Craven Street's just
round the comer. We can walk there."

  “ Yes? "—wonderingly.

  “To Mrs,*-Hallam's home, 1 mean.
It's too lale now—after five—else we
could deposit the jewels in a bank. Since
—since they're no longer yours, the only
thing to do is to get them in safety, or
to the rightful owner. If you place them
in young Hallam's hands, yours will be
clear. And—1 neveT did such a thing in
my life. Miss Calendar, but if lie’s got

a spark of gratitude in his make-up I
ought to be able to—er—borrow a pound

or two."

  Thundering and panting, the train
drew in beneath the vast dome of the
great station. Kirkwood, lifting out the
luggage, turned on the platfonn and
gave the girl his hand.

  She stepped quickly down to his side,
and together they made their way with
the pushing throng down the platform
toward the ticket-wicket.

  Here there was congestion, the pas-
sengers backing up before the wickets,
waiting their turn. Over the serried
array of silk hats and “ bowlers ” on the
inner side of the fence Kirkwood could
see its counterpart on the outside—out-
bound passengers awaiting their chance
to enter, idle onlookers, people expecting
friends. Was Calendar there?

  No other way existed for their egress
save through those revolving wickets. If
Calendar were there, or Stryker, or Mul-
ready, or all three, they could not escape
seeing the girl in Kirkwood's company.

  They ran the gauntlet of those hun-
dreds of eyes in fear and trembling. The
sensation of relief when at length they
were without and none had approached
them was exquisite. Yet it were unwise
to linger.

  “If you don’t mind hurrying. Miss
Calendar? ”

  She nodded brightly to him. her lips
firm, eyes speculative, thoughts pre-
empted with concern. In another mo-
ment they were outside the building,
undergoing the crtiss-fire of the assem-
bled cabbies.

  It being the first time that he had
ever left the station afoot, Kirkwood
paused irresolutely, casting about him
for the way to the Strand; and then ab-
ruptly caught the girl without ceremony
by the arm and hurried her toward the
step of a waiting hansom.

  “ Quick!" he told her in a single
breath. “ Your father! He hasn’t seen
us yet,” glancing back over his shoulder.
“ Stryker's with him—getting out of a
cab."

  And, “ Oh, the devil 1" cried the
panic-stricken young man to himself.

  Already the girl, instant to grasp the
situation, was seated in the hansom.
Kirkwood was lifting the second valise
CHASE OF THE GLADSTONE BAG.

up to the floor and simultaneously keep-
ing an eye on Calendar’s cab—halt the
length of th-2 station-front away.

  The fat adventurer's foot was leaving
the step as Stryker, the keen of vision,
called to him.

  Calendar turned, flushed with excite-
ment and the knowledge that his quarry
was at last in sight. Simultaneously he
pointed out the cab into which Kirk-
wood was climbing, shouting to his own
driver, and laboriously, made the more
awkward by his haste, started to hoist
his heavy carcass back into the hansom.

   To that delay alone did they owe their
temporary escape. Kirkwood, snapping
the- Craven Street address to the cabby
with a plea for extreme haste, was hard-
ly seated ere the hansom swung around
the gate-posts into the Strand.

  “ That’s the comfort of London.”
commented Kirkwood, cheerfully seating
himself : “ the cabbies are so quick when
they expect a tip.

  “Great Heavens!” as he caught the
expression in the girl's eyes. “ I never
thought.”

  His face lengthened, and his eye-,
brows twisted themselves askew.

  “Now we are in for it!” he said.
“ Well,, it's trust to luck now and take
what's coming to us.”

   But the girl said nothing.

  Kirkwood turned in his seat, craning
his neck to peer out of the small rear
window.

   “ I don’t see their cab,’’ he said, “ but
of course it's after us. They must have
been on watch at Cannon Street, and
finding we didn't get of: there—of
course. Hobbs wired them—took cab for
Charing Cross. Luckily for us. Or is
it?” he added doubtfully.

  The hansom turned down Craven
Street. Mrs. Hallam’s house stood near
the Northumberland Avenue end. Long
ere they had reached it, Kirkwood was
poised upon the step, ready to jump.
Once he looked back and saw another
hansom break through the pedestrians
at the Strand crossing and leap into
rapid pursuit.

  Vet as they neared Mrs. Hallam’s
residence the young man drew back with
a short exclamation of dismay. The
house was shut tight to the street—
blinds drawn close at the windows, the

area-gate padlocked, an estate agent’s
board projecting from above the door-
way. advertising the property “To be
Let."

  “Dnve on!’’ Kirkwood shouted to
the cabby. “ As fast as you can.”

  “ Were to. sir? ”

  “ You see that cab behind? Don’t let
it catch up. Shake it off, lose it some-
how. and it will be worth your while.
Then I’ll tell you where to go.”

  “ Right-o! ” cried the cabby, entering
into the spirit of the game with grateful
zest.

   “ Sha’n’t let ’em catch yer, sir."

  Glancing back and estimating the dis-
tance that separated the two vehicles, he
lifted whip from socket and brought it
down smartly around his horse's flanks.
The hansom seemed to jump from the
ground; it swung into Northumberland
Avenue and whirled into the Embank-
ment on a single wheel.

  Kirkwood looked again. They had
gained on the pursuer.

  “ Good ! ” he applauded beneath his
breath.

  “ How,” said the girl breathlessly—
“ how do you dare? ”

  “Dare?” echoed Kirkwood. In his
veins the excitement was running like
fire. “I’d dare a sight more than this
for you, Dorothy! ”

  “ And have dared,” the girl amended
softly; then added, with such hesitation
as to seem almost timidly, “ Philip.”

  The long lashes swept up from her
cheeks, her brown eyes brave to encoun-
ter hiS.

  But he was not looking. Manlike,
rap: with the ardor of the chase, he
was llind and deaf. And she saw that
he had not even heard and did not realize
that for the first time in their knowledge
of each other they had broken through
the rigid bounds of social convention.

  She turned away, placing an elbow on
the arm-rest, and flattening one small
gloved hand against the frame, bracing
herself against the jouncing of the ve-
hicle as it swept beside the tawny
breadth of the Thames. For the time
there was silence between them, the while
she forgot self and her present peril,
surrendering her being to the lingering
sweetness of her long, long thoughts.

little quaver in her voice.

  Unconsciously his strong fingers fell
and closed upon the little hand that lay
beside him. as unconsciously as he used
her name.

  He leaned still farther forward, peer-

at last. ar.d his pulses tightened for sheer
wonder at the humid glory in her eyes.

  “ Dorothy, child.” he said gently,
‘‘don’t worry so. dear. It's all working

  Quietly she freed her fingers.

  " I wasn't." she said shakily, in a tone
between laughter and tears “ I was—
you wouldn't understand. Don't be
afraid I shall break down.”

  “ There's no reason." he argued.
■' The cabby knows his business."

  He seemed to The hansom, racing
onward at the highest lawful rate of
speed, swung from the Embankment past
the Houses of Parliament, and with the
Abbey on hs left clattered over the cob-
bles of Old Palace Yard and Abingdon
Street, turning suddenly into the mare of
baekways. great and mean, that twine
and intertwine south of Victoria-

  Doubling and twisting, sow this way
and now that, the cabby tooled them
through t.v: maze, leading the pursuers
surh a dance as Kirkwood thought cal-
culated to lose them in two minutes. Yet.
aiways through the little window the fol-
lowing hansom kept visible, hanging
doggedly in the rear—a hundred vards

behind, no more, no less, pelting after

with indomitable determination.

  Gradually the pair drew westward,
through Pimlico and into Chelsea, once
flashing briefly down Grosvenor Road, by
the river-walL

  Children cheered them on. and bob-
bies turned to stare, wondering should
they interfere. The minutes lengthened
to tens, into an hour: and suil they kept
on. hunted and hunters, playing their
game of hide-and-seek through the high-
ways and byways of those staid old quar-
ters.

  The sun was low behind the houses
on the Surrey Side when Kirkwood no-
ticed that their horse was nagging:
though not more so than the one be-
hind. Within the past hour they seemed
to have gained a hundred feet or so upon
their persecutors.

  Concerned, the young man lifted an
arm. thrusting open the trap.

  “ You had better drive as directly as
you can for the Hotel Pless, cabby." he.
said. I'm afraid you cant keep this
up much longer.”

  “ I'm sure of it. sir." came the rough
voice from above. “ 'E's a good "oss. sir.
but 'e cara't keep goin’ forever, you know,
sir.”

 “ I know,” agreed Kirkwood
“ You’ve done very well — you’ve
done your best."

  Two blocks farther on the speed had
become so sensibly diminished that he
became genuinely alarmed. And behind
them the pursuing cabby was lashing his
horse.

  While, “ It aren't no use me whippin'
'im. sir,” came through the trap. " "E's
doin' orl e can.”

  “ I know.”

  Desperation tightened Kirkwood's lips
and fired a glitter in his eye. He bent
forward and lifted to his knees the girl's
traveling-bag. in which the gladstone was
concealed.

  “ What are you going to do ? ” asked
the girl, voice a tremble.

  “ Take a chancc—the last chance.
You'll stand by me ? ”

  “ Km know." she told him.

  '■ Then-" Kirkwood stood op.

  They were traversing a street in Old
Brompton—a quaint old street lined with
houses curiously Old-Worldish even for

gables, old dormer-windows, their -ccl

a shining white, each owning a trim door-

  fheir numbers dropped past—shiny
brass plates set in the door-panels.

 «• 45 43 41.” Now, Kirk-
wood was twenty-five years of age. as has
been said.

  “ Cabby,” he cried over the roof of the
hansom, “ put us down at number twenty-
five, and wait—will you. please? ”

  “ Very good, sir.”

  Kirkwood turned to meet the girl’s
wondering eyes.

  “ As soon as the cab stops, please." he
said significantly.

  She nodded blankly.

  He waited, poised with a foot on the
step. He wondered how insane he would
consider this contemplated proceeding in
a quieter moment.

  The hansom pulled in sharply at the
curb, its pursuer half a block away.
Kirkwood jumped down (with the bag.
be sure) and gave a hand to the girl,
who leaped lightly to his side.

  “ Come! " he told her briefly, nodding
to the cabman: and hurried her through
the gate of number twenty-five and up the
short flagged walk. Then, on the spot-
less white stoop, rang the bell, and
emphasized his haste by pealing a thun-
derous summons on the knocker.

  Behind their waiting hansom the sec-
ond cab drew in. and Calendar could be
seen lifting himself ponderously out of it.

  Kirkwood's fingers’ itched for the
knocker. He had lifted his hand, when
the door opened, and on the threshold he
l>eheld, not the butler or the smart white-
capped maid that he had thought to see,
but the figure of a man evidently the
head of the house. At a glance, a tallish
man. slender, with a thin, pink face, a
white mustache and shrewd kindly eyes
gleaming somewhat wistfully behind his
glasses.

  “ I beg your pardon.” volunteered
Kirkwood hastily, as the inquiring gaze
fell upon him : “ but may I beg five min-
utes of your time—at once? ”

  The shadow of a smile appeared on
ihe thin, straight lips: the keen eyes
ranged from his face to the waiting cab.

 to Calendar dropping hastily to the side-
 walk, to the face of the girl at Kirk-
 wood's side.

    The thin lids drooped a trifle.

   “ Won't you come in? ” said the house-
 holder.

   Kirkwood stood aside, giving way to
 the girl, smiling a confidence into’her
 eyes which (it must be confessed) he did
 not himse:' feel. Under its spell her
 momentary hesitation vanished ; trusting,
 submissive, she bowed a little distant bow
 to the strange: and entered the hallway.

   As Kirkwood followed her the house-
 holder stepped past him to the door-
 stoop. Calendar was at the gate, his fat
 fingers fumbling with the latch, his
 round red face dark with wrath.

   “Do you wish tc see me?" inquired
 die householder mildly, peering over his
 spectacles.

   Calendar paused with his hand on the
 gate.

   " I want my daughter.” he vociferated
 loudly.

   The stranger's gaze veered to Kirk-
 wood’s face, lingered momentarily on the
 young man's honest eyes, and returned to
 Calendar.

   " My dear sir,” he said, in the same
 mild tone, “ will you be kind enough to
 take yourself off—tc the devil if you
 like? Or shall I call in the police?”

   The fat adventurer, thunderstruck,
 halted on the path, then swung and
 looked in the direction indicated * -Jje
 householder’s gestures.

   A blue-coated limb of the law was at
 the instant advancing with measured
 stride from the nearer comer.

   Calendar's mouth opened and closed.
 His moon-like countenance was still fur-
 ther eclipsed by the shadow of his dis-
 concertment. Abruptly he turned and
 made off. banging the gate behind him.

 turned and waved the overwhelmed
 American into his house.

CHAPTER XXII.

THE AMATEUR ADVENTURER.

   Di mkoi nded, Kirkwood preceded his
 host through the hall to a small, book-
 lined library in the rear of the house.
686

THE ALL-STORY MAGAZINE.

  Here a fire burned, crackling happily
in a grate both wide and deep, and a
shaded reading-lamp diffused its pleasant
homely glow upon the surface of a table
littered with magazines and books. In
the air there swam a fine aroma of good
tobacco, the fumes from a half-consumed
cigar drifting in thin blue reefs in the
lamplight.

   At the fireplace, one small foot on the
brassy fender, Dorothy stood, looking
down, the sensitive sweetness of her face
illumined and enhanced by the rich rud-
dy glow upflung from the bedded coals.

   One entered tliis room as into a haven
of peace.

  Beyond the threshold, as the girl
looked up, Kirkwood turned to face
his host; candidly, yet a trace nervously.
Ere he could speak, however, the other
gave him pause with a white and fragile
hand, asking for attention.

  “ Sir,” said the owner of the hand,
somewhat austerely, “ permit me to put
one question: Have you by any chance
paid your cabby? ”

  The younger man blushed painfully.
The other quietly laid his hand upon a
bell-pull. A faint jingle was audible in
the depths of the house.

  “ How much should you say vou owe
him?”

  “ I have not a penny in the world,”
said Kirkwood courageously, as his host,
thrusting a hand into his pocket, with-
drew it, filled with coin.

  The shrewd eves flickered amusement
into his.

  “ Tut, tut! ” with a chuckle. " Be-
tween gentlemen, my dear sir! How
much did you say ? ”

  “ Ten shillings—or twelve would be
nearer right,” stammered Kirkwood
wretchedly, divided between gratitude
and profound amazement.

  At this moment a short and paunchy
butler appeared haughtily in the door.

   Hi? master quietly selected a half-sov-
ereign and a half-crown from his hand-
ful and gave them to the servant. “ For
the cabby, Wot ton."

  “ Yessir.” The butler swung precise-
ly on his heel.

  “And. Wotton!”

   “ Yessir ? ”

  “If any one should ask for me, I am
not at home.”

  “ Yessir.”

  The butler vanished; a moment later
they heard him close the front door as he
went out.

  His host turned from Kirkwood, Tub-
bing his hands.

  “ My dear,” he said, addressing the
girl—“ I am old enough to call you my
dear without offense, I trust—won’t you
take this chair and make yourself more
comfortable? ”

  She rewarded him with a radiant
smile. Whereupon their host strode to
the fire, turned his back to it, and
clasped his hands behind him, glower-
ing at Kirkwood over his glasses.

  “ Ah! ” he commented, in a tone of ex-
treme personal satisfaction. “ Romance!
Romance! ”

  “ Would you mind telling me how you
knew 1 had not paid my cabby, sir ? ” in-
quired Kirkwood anxiously, as yet not
half recovered from his stupefaction.

  “ Simply enough, my dear sir; I pos-
sess an imagination. From my bedroom
window I behold two cabs racing down
the street, the one madly pursuing the
other. The foremost draws up at my
carriage-block; alights therefrom a gen-
tleman looking (if you’ll pardon me) un-
commonly seedy, followed by a young
lady (if she will pardon me),” with a
little bow, “ uncommonly pretty.

  “ With these two old eyes I observe
that the gentleman does not pay the cab-
by. On the other hand, he brings his
traveling-bag to my door, which argues
that he purposes making me a visit of
some length; in which case he certainly
should not keep a cabby waiting. Was I
justified? ”

  “ Unfortunately,” assented Kirkwood,
“ you were.”

  And grinned, enchanted with the
charming consideration shown them by
their host:

  “ So, so! ” assented the gentleman.
“ So the world wags to the old tune!
And I, who in my youth pursued adven-
ture without success, in my old age find
myself dragged into a romance by my
two ears, whether I will or no! eh ? And
now you are going to tell me all about it.
There is a chair, Mr.—er? ”

  “ My name is Kirkwood—Philip Kirk-
wood.”

  “ Permit me to introduce myself as

Brentwick — Arthur Brentwick. And
you. my dear ? ”

  “ I am Dorothy Calendar."

  Mr. Brentwick removed his glasses,
rubbed them, and blinked thoughtfully
at the girl.

  “ My dear." he said suddenly, “ you
look remarkably like your mother, l'ut!
I should know; I was one of her most
ardent admirers. But that can wait.”

  He replaced his glasses, waved Kirk-
wood peremptorily to a chair, and rubbed
his hands.

  “ Now, my dear sir, for the adven-
ture ! ”

  “ But how do you know-”

  “How can it be otherwise?” with a
trace of asperity. “ Am I to be denied
my adventure? I refuse, sir. unequivo-
cally! Your very bearing breathes of
romance. If there be no adventure forth-
coming. I regret to say that my disap-
pointment is so acute that I must show
you the door.”

   “ Sir! ” cried Kirkwood, rising, on his
dignity.

  “Sit down!” barked Mr. Brentwick,
so abruptly that the young man obeyed
out of sheer astonishment. Upon which
his host advanced and menaced him with
a long white forefinger.

  “ Would you, sir," he demanded,
“ again expose this little lady to the
machinations of that corpulent scoundrel
whom I have just had the pleasure of
shooing off my premises because you
choose to resent an old man’s raillery?
For shame. Mr. Kirkwood! ”

   “ I am sorry, sir," said the young man
humbly.

   “ You are right to be. Sir, if the story's
long, epitomize! We can have the de-
tails later if your case be extreme.”

   “ Briefly, then,” said Kirkwood, halt-
ingly, “ the man who followed us to your
door is Miss Calendar’s father."

  “ Ah!"

  “ Fie is pursuing us, Mr. Brentwick,
with the intention of obtaining some
property to which he has no right, and
which we are trying to return to its own-
ers.”

  “ My dear! ” said Mr. Brentwick gen-
tly. looking down at the girl’s flushed and
drooping head.

  “ I,” continued Kirkwood, “ am penni-
less to-day; I’ve spent my last farthing.

If I can cable to New York I can get a
few pounds from my personal friends
and repay you. Mr. Brentwick. I came
to your door by accident—it might as
well have been another; I ask your gen-
erosity, the shelter of your roof for a
while, on Miss- Calendar's behalf. It is
necessary that she should reach Chiltern
this evening, where she has friends who
will receive her and protect her. Will
you aid us? "

  “ Hmtn.” grumbled Mr. Brentwick
meditatively.

  “ My faith!” he commented, his face
brightening. “ It’s almost too good to
be true! And / had been afraid the
world was getting to be a humdrum
place! My dear,” to the girl, “ what
Mr. Kirkwood tells me is quite—er-”

  The girl lifted her chin a trace resent-
fully.

  “ Whatever Mr. Kirkwood tells you,
sir, could be nothing else,” she returned
simply. “ But I’m sure you do not
doubt-”

  “ Doubt! My faith, no. my dear!
Doubr! ” he snorted indignantly. “ This
is altogether too fine to be doubted.
What is it, Wotton? ”

  The butler had appeared silently in
the doorway. “ Beg pardon, sir. the gen-
tleman’s valise, sir. Left in the cab,
sir.”

  “ You may put it down, Wotton. And.
Wotton, don’t you think you need a
breath of air? ”

  “ Yessir; thank you,' sir,” assented the
man readily.

  “ Then you may change your coat,
Wotton, and light your pipe and stroll
out for a quarter of an hour. And if
you should see a tall, thin gentleman with
a seafaring air (you see, I have quick
eyes, Mr. Kirkwood), or a short, stout
gentleman with an air of mystery, taking
an interest in these premises you might
make a note of it, Wotton."

   " Y.essir.”

  “ And if one of the gentlemen, or
both, should annoy you with conver-
sation, Wotton, you will be careful not
to tell them anything in particular; al-
though I authorize you to inform them
that Mr. Brentwick lives here, if they
ask."

  “ Yessir; thank you. sir."

  “ You may go. Wotton.

ting forward and lacing his long white
lingers, -I that we avoid the perils of cab
and railway-carriage and proceed to
Chiltern by motor. Miss Calendar, have
you any objection? ”

  The girl looked to Kirkwood.

  “ 1 have none,” she said quietly.

  “ And you. sir? ”

  “ You are very thought l'ul,” said Kirk-
wood. “ I can't think of anything better
calculated to throw them off the trail
than to distance them by motor. It would
be always easy to trace our route by rail.”

  “ Then,” said their host, making as if
to rise, “ we had best go. If my ears—or
Captain Stryker’s car—does not deceive
me, our fiery chariot is panting at the
curb.”

  They rose, a little sobered from the
gaiety with which they had dined. Brent-
wick’s house had been to them a tower of
refuge in time of stress. Now they were
to go forth again, to dare the pitfalls of
Calendar the ingenious and purposeful.

  Not that either greatly feared the out-
come; but there is always room for error
in human calculations. Calendar’s had
already proved fallible. Within the
bounds of possibility their turn to stum-
ble might now be at hand.

  When he dwelt upon it, their sneer im-
potency to stay Calendar by ordinary
methods bade fair to madden Kirkwood.
With any other man, it had been so sim-
ple a matter to put a period to his career
by a word to a policeman, but in this case
it was Dorothy’s hands that had stolen
the jewels; innocently though she had
committed the larceny, a catspaw. a tool
in the hands of an intelligence malign
and unscrupulous, the law would not
hold her guiltless were she once brought
within its cognizance. Nor would the
Hallams.

  Upon their knowledge and fear of
this Calendar was* calculating : witness
the boldness with which he was operating.
His fear of the police was genuine
enough, but he was never for a moment
troubled by apprehensions of his daugh-’
ter turning against him. She would not
dare.

  Before they left the house, Kirkwood
recounoitered from the drawing-room
windows. At the carriage-block their
motor-car rested, humming contentedly.
At the corner a smaller car stood in wait-

    8	S

ing, its lamps glaring balefully through
the night.

  Opposite the house a figure—Stryker’s
—lurked in the. shadows. Otherwise, the
street was deserted; not even the provi-
dential bobby of the early evening was in
evidence.

  Wotton, outwardly immobile and
nerveless, let them out’ by the front door,
shutting it so abruptly behind them as
to give rise to the suspicion that beneath
his icy exterior he feared desperately that
the house might be stormed by tlie ad-
venturers.

  Kirkwood to the right, Brentwick to’
the left, of the girl, each carrying one of
the valises, they hastened down the path,
through the gate, and into the car.
Brentwick taking-the front seat by the
mechanic—a dark shape in goggles and a
touring-coat that shone like an oilskin—
left the tonneau to Kirkwood and the
girl.

  A near-by street-lamp made all this
clearly visible to the watcher across the
way.

  As Kirkwood slammed shut the ton-
neau-door and the car began to move
Stryker whistled shrilly and the other car
swept up the street, slowing down to let
him jump aboard.

  Then it fell in at the rear, attempting
no greater speed than was necessary to
keep the leading car in sight. Calen-
dar’s design to leave them no instant’s
freedom from observation was obvious.
He purposed keeping forever at their el-
bow, waiting his chance, waiting the mo-
ment when, wearied, their vigilance
should relax.

  To some extent he had reckoned with-
out his motor-car. As long as they were
within the city limits, compelled to main-
tain a decorous pace in deference to the
prejudices of the London City Council,
it was an easy matter to trail the motor-
car that bore the jewels.

 But once they had swung north
through Kensington to Shepherd s Bush
and down the Uxbridge Road, paced by
flying trams through Hammersmith to
Southall, the complexion of the business-
was changed—for the worse, as t aleridar
viewed it.

  The scattered lights of Southall drop-
ping behind them, Brentwick spoke a low-
toned word to the mechanic.

of the open road. Its deep and silken
humming altered with startling sudden-
ness to a resounding purr. A mile of
highway hail been flung behind almost
ere they had time to catch their breath.
And another and another, miles piling
upon miles, the wide darkling country-
side opening out before them, free and
clean.

  A lurch threw the girl against
Kirkwood, and she caught at his arm to
save herself. Very gently he took her
hand, passed it beneath his arm. and
closed his fingers over it. Perhaps the
wildness of this dash through the night,
the sonorous roar of the motor, the buf-
feting of the night-wind. violent in her
face, rendered her a thought forget-
ful : she made no move as if to draw
away.

  When he looked down into the face so
near to his she smiled contentedly up into
his eyes: and the perilous sweetness of
lips and eyes that were shown him by
the light of the far shining stars tempted
him almost beyond his strength.

  Y'et this was not the time; time enough
when he had gone back to his place—or.
rather, when he should have found it—
in the ranks of the wage-earners, and so
proved his right to happiness, to lay what
he had to offer at her feet.

  So he turned his face forward, half
dreaming, half planning, against the
struggle that was to make his future.
Thus they rode, at length free, contented
in the knowledge that safety lay before
them, that they were with friends, that
their persecutors labored unavailing])’
far behind them, striving to compass the
impossible—the impossible, that is. bar-
ring the intervention of the unforeseen.

  Llalf an hour of this, then Kirkwood
began to be conscious that their speed
was slackening. He could hear the me-
chanic's voice, grumbling, as he fussed
with the driving-gear. _ He heard Brent-
wick fling him a sharp-toned query, get a
reply as short.

  And steadily the speed decreased, until
at length they were moving scarcely
faster than a cab had carried them, snail-
like. to their former pace.

  Brent wick leaned bark over the ton-
neau.

  “ Trouble,” he announced briefly. “ I'm
afraid we’ve blundered."

  “ What is it? " inquired the girl, bend-
ing forward.

  “ Petrol’s giving out. Charles, here,
says that the tank must have leaked.
We'll do the best we can and stop at the
first inn : a majority of the inns maintain
stores of petrol for just such emergencies
now.”

  “ Are we—do you think-” Kirk-
wood put in.

  “Oh. not a bit of it I They'll not
catch up with us this night. That’s a
poor car they have—nothing to compare
with this, my dear sir. We'll reach the
Crown and Mitre, just ahead, tank up.
and be off long before they make up hall'
what they've lost.”

  Dorothy looked anxiously at Kirk-
wood. . her lips forming the inaudible
query, What did he think?

  “ Oh, we’ll have no trouble." he as-
sured her. “ The chauffeur knows, un-
doubtedly."

  Nevertheless, he stood up in the ton-
neau. the traveling-bag beneath his feet,
conscious of the revolver weighing heav-
ily in his pocket, and stared back along
the road. There was absolutely nothing
visible.

  The car continued to crawl. Some five
minutes elapsed. Gradually they drew
abreast a roadside tavern standing a little
back from the road, embowered in trees,
the lights of its tap-room and parlor
glowing invitingly between their trunks.
A creaking sign on a post by the roadside
informed all and sundry that here was
the Crown and Mitre, ready to furnish
entertainment for man and beast.

  The car stopped.

  Charles, the mechanic, jumped out and
ran up the path toward the inn. Brent-
wick turned again, his eyes shining in the
starlight, his brow quaintly furrowed, his
voice apologetic.

  ‘ It may take a few moments.” he said,
plainly endeavoring to hide his concern.
“ My dear, if I have brought trouble to
you I shall never earn my own forgive-
ness.”

  Kirkwood stood up again, watchful,
listening.

  “ I hear nothing.” he said.

  " You will forgive me. won’t you, my
dear, for causing you these few anxious
CHASE OF THE GLADSTONE BAG.

moments?” pleaded the old gentleman,
his tone tremulous.

  “ As if you could be blamed' " pro-
tested the girl. “ You must not think of
it that way. Fancy, what should we
have done without you? ”

  " Mr. Kirkwood, do you hear any-
thing ? ”

  “ Nothing as yet. sir,” responded the
young man.

  “ Perhaps," said Brentwick, -i we had
best alight and go up to the inn. It
would be more comfortable there,
especially if the petrol proves hard to
procure and we have long to wait."

  “ I should like to very much," said the
girl.

 Kirkwood nodded approval and
opened the door, stepping out to assist
her. Then he picked up the bag and
followed the pair.

  Brentwick had gallantly offered his
arm. and she had accepted it as readily.

  Charles met them in the doorway, ap-
parently vexed.

  “No petrol to be had here, sir,” he said,
touching the vizor of his cap. “ They are
going to send a mile up the road for
some. You will have to be patient, I’m
afraid, sir.”

  Kirkwood paused again, listening at-
tentively, before he entered. But the
wind was blowing in the direction from
which they had come, and he heard
naught but the sighing of it in the trees
and an echo of rustic laughter from the
tap-room.

  A red-cheeked landlady bowed and
scraped before them until they had en-
tered a private parlor, then departed in
search of light refreshments ordered by
Brentwick.

  The girl seated herself upon a couch
and made a palpable attempt to appear
at ease. Brentwick stood by the window,
tall figure bent, hands clasped behind his
back, as he peered out into the night.
Kirkwood dropped the valise beneath a
chair and took to pacing the floor.

  The minutes lagged sluggishly, ticked
oil by the pendulum of the tall grand-
father’s clock in the corner. The land-
lady did not reappear, for some reason
unconscionably delayed. Brentwick re-
marked upon the fact querulously, then
abruptly turned away from the window
and drew a chair up bv the table.

  " We must not permit ourselves to be
worried," he said, with a thin smile.

“ My dear, won’t you sit here? And,
Mr. Kirkwood, will you bring up your
chair? I have something to show you
that may perhaps engage vour interest'for
a while."

  To humor him and alleviate his ap-
parent distress, they acceded, Kirkwood
seating himself opposite the girl, with
Brentwick between them. The latter,
with some hesitation, thrust a hand into
an inner coat-pocket and produced a
small black-leather wallet. Fie seemed
about to open it, then suddenly laid it
upon the table, as steps approached the
•room.

   Charles burst in. leaving the door wide. •

  “Mr. Brentwick, sir!" he panted.

 That car-”

  Kirkwood leaped to his feet, tugging at
the weapon in his pocket.

  In another breath he had the revolver
exposed. The girl uttered a little low
cry, sitting very still. Brentwick, with a
sharp exclamation, turned upon Kirk-
wood, and clamping strong, supple fin-
gers upon the younger man’s wrist, with
the other hand laid hold of the re-
volver and by a single twist wrenched
it away.

  Kirkwood turned upon him furiously.

  “ So! ” he cried, his voice vibrant.

“ This is what your hospitality meant ■ I
might have known-”

  " My dear sir,” retorted Mr. Brent-
wick, with a flash of impatience, “ had I
desired to betray you I would have asked
no better opportunity than when you
were in my own house! ”

  “ But-” expostulated Kirkwood,

trembling as heavy footsteps drummed
the tempo of haste in the hallway.

  11	Would you have bullets flying when
this young lady is about?” demanded
Brentwick.

  He slid the revolver hurriedly upon
a shelf beneath the table-top.

  “ Sir! ” lie told Kirkwood with heat.

“ you are a young fool! 1 was once, too
—and would to Heaven I were again!
Take my advice and he calm—it's the
only way to save your treasure! ”

  “Hang the jewels!" cried Kirkwood
hotly.

  “Sir, who said anything about the
jewels? ”—as indignantly.

THE ALL-STORY MAGAZINE.

  At that moment Calendar appeared in
the doorway. Stryker’s weather-beaten
countenance leering over his shoulder.

CHAPTER XXIV.

MR. CALENDAR AND CARE: POSITIVELY
THEIR FAREWELL APPEARANCE.

  The fat adventurer hung momentarily
on the threshold, quick eyes taking in the
four within the Crown and Mitre parlor.
A shade of satisfaction colored his ex-
pression. He smiled wickedly into the
close, short thatch of his gray mustache
and held his revolver poised for instant
use.

  But there was no necessity. Breut-
wick and Kirkwood had resumed their
seats. The girl had not stirred from
hers from the first alarm: she was lean-
ing f T-.vard. elbows on table, hands tight-
ly clasped, her face—a little blanched—
turning toward the doorway. Her lips
were set and white with courage, and the
brown eyes met Calendar s in a level and
unflinching glance. Beyond this she
made no sign of recognition.

  Charles, the mechanic, stood nearest
the adventurers, rigid in frightened as-
tonishment.

  Calendar, advancing suddenly, poked
at him with the revolver.

  “ Get back. Four-Eyes'” he snapped.
44 Get cut of my way! ”

  And the mechanic jumped as if shot,
then hastily retreated to the table, his
features working beneath the goggle-
mask that had excited Calendar’s de-
rision.

  “ Come in cap n." Calendar threw
over his shoulder. ‘ Come in, close the
door, and lock it! ”

  The captain obeyed, grimacing mock-
ingly at Kirkwood. Calendar advanced
jauntily to within a yard of the table,
then stopped, smiling complacently down
upon the little party lie had trapped and
twirling his revolver airily-

•• Good evening." he gave them bland-

ly.

  “ Dorothy, my child.” with assumed
concern. “ you are looking a trifle pale:
I’m afraid you've been keeping late
hours.

" Mr. Kirkwood, it’s delightful to see
you again! Permit me to remind you that

pistol-shots are apt to attract atten-
t:c n. It wouldn't be wise for voj to bring
the police about our ears. 1 Itelieve those
were your words to me in the cabin of the
Alethea : were they not ?

  " And you, sir.'' staring hard at Brent-
wick; you animated fossil, what d'ye
mean by telling me to go to the devil?
But let that pass; I forgive you. What
might your name be? "

  “ Brentwick." said that gentleman pla-
cidly.

  He seemed about to say something
more, but held his tongue, smiling.

  " Brentwick. eh? I'm charmed to meet
you. I'm sure. But permit me to advise
you not to come a second time between a
father and his daughter: another man
might not be so patient with you. I here's
a law in the land. Mr. Brentwick! "

  “ It thoughtful of you not to go to
law." observed Brentwick quietly.

1’hen. with a change of note:
Come, sir! you have unwarrantably in-
vaded this room, which I have engaged.
Get through with your business and be
off with yon! ”

  l' Eh, what's that, my antediluvian
friend? Oh, all in my good - time.
'A'hen I've concluded my business with
you. I'll go—not before. But now we'll
get down to it. Mr. Kirkwood, you have
a revolver belonging to me. Kindly re-
turn it.”

  “ It’s under the table,” interposed
Brentwick suavely. “ Shall I hand :• to
you ? ”

  “ By the muzzle, if you please. Be
very careful—mine's loaded, toe. Apt to
go off at any moment.”

  Brentwick. to Kirkwood's intense dis-
gust, quietly slipped a hand underneath
the table, and placing the revolver on its
top. gently shoved it over to the farther
edge. Calendar, with a satisfied grunt,
dropped the weapon in his pocket.

  “Any more?" he demanded sharply,
eyes flitting alertly from face to face.
■* Well, yon wouldn’t dare use them, any-
way. And I’m about through with you.
Dorothy, my child, it’s high time you re-
turned to your father’s protection. Where
is that gladstone bag? ” .

  “ In my traveling-bag.” she told him
in even, expressionless accents.

  “ Then bring it along. Vou may say
good night to the gentlemen.”
CHASE OF THE GLADSTONE BAG.

693

  The girl did not move; her pallor grew
slightly more intense. Her lips seemed a
trace more straight and firm.

  “ Dorothy! ” cried the adventurer
sharply. " Do you hear me? ”

   “ I hear you,” she replied, a little wear-
ily.

  " Never mind, please, Mr. Kirk-
wood ! ” with a little appealing gesture.
“ Don't say anything. I am not going
with this man.”

  Calendar's features worked nervously.
He chewed at the corner of his mustache,
eying the girl angrily.

  “ I presume,” he said presently, con-
trolling his emotion, “ that you are aware
that I, as your parent, am in a position to
remove you forcibly if you refuse to re-
turn to me.”

  “ I shall not go with you," iterated the
girl calmly. “ Whether by force or no,
if I go to prison—with you—in penalty
lor resisting, I shall not go. Mr. Brent-
wick and Mr. Kirkwood are taking me to
—some friends of mine, where I will be
comfortable. That is all I have to say to
you.”

  “Bravo, my dear!” Brentwick ap-
plauded in an aside which did not escape
Calendar.

  “Mind your own business, sir!” he
thundered, his face purple with fury.

  Then more steadily to his daughter:
" You understand, of course, what this
means. I offer you a home, and a good
one. If you refuse it, you work for your
liviug, my girl! You’ve forfeited the
Burgoyne legacy.”

  “ I know, I know,” she said con-
temptuously. “I am content. Won't
you please to leave me alone? "

  For an instant Calendar glowered over
her.

   “ I presume,” he said acidly, *' that all
these heroics are inspired by this whip-
per-snapper, Kirkwood. Do ycu know
that he hasn't a brass farthing to his
name? ”

  “ What has that-" cried the girl

indignantly.

  “ Why, it’s everything to do with it.
my child. You can't marry on nothing a
year. For I surmise that you propose to
marry this Kirkwood, don't you? ”

  There followed a little interval of si-
lence, while the hot blood flamed in the
girl’s face and the red lips quivered as

she faced her tormentor. Then, with a
break in her voice that escaped her con-
trol :

  “ If Mr. Kirkwood asks me. I shall.”
she said very quietly.

  “ That,” Kirkwood interposed. " is un-
derstood.”

  His gaze sought her face, but she
would not look toward him.

  Calendar loomed above them, trem-
bling with anger.

  “ You don’t seem to take into consider-
ation the fact that I’m your father and
you a minor.” "lie told them bitingly. " I
can refuse my consent.”

  “ But you won't,” said Kirkwood eas-
ily.

  “ No,” agreed the adventurer, after an
instant’s hesitation.

  “ No, I sha’n't interfere. Take her.
my boy. if you want her," he added iron-
ically. “ The Lord knows I’ve troubles
enough—a father's lot is not an easy
one.” He paused, sardonic, sneering.

  “ But,” he continued deliberately.
“ there's this little matter of the glad-
stone bag. I am ready to abandon my

paternal authority, but my property-"

  “ It is not your property." interrupted
the girl.

  “ It was your mother's, my child. It
is now mine.”

  “ I question that." Kirkwood put in.

  “ You may question what you like,”
Calendar told him. undisturbed. “ The
fact remains that I propose to remove my
property when I go. whether you like it
or not. Are you going to raise any se-
rious objection, or may 1 count on your
being sensible?”

' “ You may put up your revolver, if
that's what you mean," said Kirkwood.
“ We shall certainly not oppose you with
violence. But I warn vou that Scotland

Yard-"

  “ Oh, that be blowed! " snorted the ad-
venturer, in disgust. “ I can sail circles
round any beak that ever blew out of
Scotland Yard. You can give me an
hour's stan and you can do all the busi-
ness you want to with—Scotland Yard.' ”
“ Then you acknowledge.” said Brent-
wick suavely—the old gentleman had
been a quietly intere>ted spectator
through it ail—" that you've no legal
title to the jewels?”

  " Look here, m' friend,” chuckled the
adventurer complacently. “ when you
catch me acknowledging anything you
make a note of it and tell a bobby. Just
at present, I’ve got something better to
do than go 'bout making acknowledg-
ments. Stryker, hand me that teg ol‘ my
dutiful daughter's."

   “ ’Ere you are,” said the captain, lift-
ing the valise from beneath the chair and
depositing it on the table before Kirk-
wood.

  “ We don’t take anything that doesn't
belong to us,” laughed Calendar, fum-
bling with the catch; “ not even when it's
so small a matter as my own child's trav-
eling-bag.

   11A small, heavy, black gladstone bag,”
he added, opening the valise and plung-
ing liis hand in. “ will just about do for
me."

  He drew the jewel-satchel out and set
it the table.

  " 1'ake this away, Stryker,” he
chuckled mirthfully, pushing the girl's
valise aside. And stood, rumbling with
stentorian laughter, beaming benignantly
around at the assembled company.

  “ Why,” he exclaimed, “ this is worth
all the trouble it has cost me! My chil-
dren. I forgive you freely. Mr. Kirk-
wood. I congratulate you on having
secured a most expensive wife for a starve-
ling painter! Really, 1 don’t know but
what I ought to do something for you
both.”

  He gurgled delightedly, rubbing his
fat mottled palms together.

  “ I tell you what,” he resumed, “ no
one yet ever accused Georgie Calendar of
being mean. I'm just going to make you
a handsome wedding-present.

  “ The good Lord knows,” he mumbled,
“ that there’s enough here for a fellow
to throw a little something away and
never miss it.”

  The thick red fingers tore at the catch
nervously, and finally got the bag
opened. Flicse about the table bent for-
ward, themselves a little warmed by ex-
citement over the prospect of for the first
time beholding that for which they had
fought and suffered so long.

  A heavy and luscious fragrance per-
vaded the atmosphere, exhaled from the
open mouth of the gladstone bag.

  A tense silence made itself felt by
those in the room—a breathless pause

broken at length by ?. ;-harp snap of Cal-
endar’s white teeth.

  “M-m-m!" he grunted heavily, and
began to pant.

  Abruptly his heavy hands began to dig
into the contents of the bag as a terrier
digs into the ground. The air seemed
momentarily thick with flying objects.

  Beneath Kirkwood’s astonished eyes a
towel fell upon the table—a towel bear-
ing on its dingy hem the inscription, in
poor chirography and indelible ink:
“ Hotel du Commerce, Anvers.”

 A heavy earthenware tooth-mug
dropped to the floor with a crash. A
slimy soap-dish slid across the table-top
and into Brentwick’s lap.

  A battered alarm-clock with not a tick
left in its abused carcass rang vacuously
as it fell beside the bag. The rest was
oranges—a dozen or more small, round,
golden globes of ripe fruit, perhaps a
trifle overripe, and therefore the more
aromatic.	-

  Suddenly Calendar ripped out an oath.
“ Mulready, by the living God! ” he
cried furiously. “ Tricked by that infer-
nal blackguard! Me—blind as a bat!
That’s why he bought those damned
oranges, is it? That’s why he was so
bent on picking a fight with me on the
boat, hey?

  “ And that’s why lie was so knocked cut
he couldn’t help me hunt you two blessed
idiots down, eh? Well—by—the—Eter-
nal ! I’ll camp on his trail for the rest
of his natural-born days! I’ll have his
heart's blood for this! ”

  He swayed, gibbering in his rage, his
face shockingly congested, his fat hands
shaking as with ague on the rim of the
gladstone bag. •	'

  And suddenly, while still their own as-
tonishment held Kirkwood and the girl
speechless, Charles, the mechanic, with
a swift movement bent forward over the
valise.

  Kirkwood heard two metallic clicks,
so close together that they sounded as
one.

  Calendar’s ravings were shut off as if
his tongue had become paralyzed. He
dropped hack a step, flabby jowls pale
and shaking, heavy jaw drooping on his
breast, mouth wide and eyes protruding,
as he clashed before him his thick fleshy
wrists—securely handcuffed.
CHASE OF THE GLADSTONE BAG.

  Instantly the mechanic whirled about,
bounded across the floor, and caught
Stryker at the door, his quick fingers
twisting in the man’s coat-collar as he
yanked him back and threw him.

  “ Mr. Kirkwood! ” cried the mechanic.
“ Here—one moment. Take that gun
away from this man. will you? ”

  Kirkwood sprang to his assistance, and
without difficulty or, indeed, encounter-
ing great resistance, wrested a revolver
from the captain’s limp, trembling fin-
gers.

  Roughly the mechanic shook the man,
dragging him to his feet once more.

  “ Now,” he said sternly, “ you go over
there in the corner and turn your face to
the wall and be good! You can’t get
away, anyway. I’ve got men watching
fer you outside.”

  Stryker, trembling like a whipped cur.
meekly obeyed his instructions to the
letter.

  “ Charles,” turning, away from him
with a contemptuous laugh, strode back
to Calendar, at the same time removing
his goggles, and clapped a heavy hand
upon the adventurer’s quivering shoul-
ders.

  “Well!” he cried heartily. “Still
sailing circles round Scotland Yard, Sim-
mons, or Cartwright, or Bellows, or San-
derson, or Calendar, or Crumbstone—or
whatever name you prefer to be known
by? ”

" Calendar glared at him, aghast.

  Then heaved a heavy sigh, shrugged
his fat shoulders in resignation, and
dropped his head in thought. Abruptly
he looked up.

  “ You can’t do it,” he told the de-
tective violently; “ you’ve got not one
atom of proof against me! What’s there
—a pile of oranges and a peck of trash?
Besides, if you take me in you'll have to
take that girl, too, for I swear she did the
stealing ! I’ll not be trapped this way
through her and let her go on her way re-
joicing. If you take me—take her. d’ye
hear.”

  “ I think,” put in the clear, bland
voice of Mr. Brentwick, “that we can
consider that matter settled.

  “ Here.” he said, picking up the wallet
in which he had asserted Kirkwood and
the girl would find something to interest
them, “ here is a little matter that may

clear up any lingering doubts that you
may entertain.”

  He extracted a slip of cardboard and
gently shoved it across the table. Calen-
dar, bewildered, bent over it for a mo-
ment, then straightened up. shook him-
self, laughed uneasily, and turned to the
detective.

  “ It’s come with you. I suppose?” he
said.

  “ The Remsen warrant is still out for
you,” returned the man. “ That'll be
good enough to hold you on.”

  “ Oh, all right. I’ll come peaceably.
I guess,” said Mr. Calendar thoughtful-
ly, jingling the manacles, “ I’m a back
number anyway. It’s up to me to quit
and live at the country’s expense for the
rest of my days when a half-grown girl,
a half-baked artist, a flub like Mulready,
and a club-footed snipe from Scotland
Yard can put it all over me this way.

  “ Yep.” he sighed, " time to quit. But
I would like to get in one good lick at
that blackguard Mulready! ”

  “ Don’t worry about him,” advised the
detective. “ We got a wire from the Am-
sterdam police this afternoon saying that
they’d picked up Mr. Mulready and a
woman named Hallam on suspicion:
they were opening negotiations for the
sale of a lot of stones, and seemed in
such a precious hurry that the diamond
merchant’s suspicions were aroused.
There was a kid named Frederick Hallam
at their hotel, and they’ve got him under
surveillance, too.”

  “Amen!” grunted Calendar. “I'm
blame glad to hear it. 'Twouldn't be a
square deal, otherwise.”

  He turned, nodded uncertainly to the
girl, Kirkwood, and Brentwick, then,
with the detective’s hand under his arm
and accompanied by the thoroughly
cowed Stryker, waddled awkwardly out
of the room.

  Kirkwood, following the trio to the
door, shut it carefully and returned slow-
ly to the table.

  The girl had hardly moved, save to
place elbows on the dark polished mahog-
any slab and cradle her cheeks between
hands still clenched.

  The color had returned to her face,
with a little enhanced depth of hue, to
be credited to her excitement. Her
checks were hot. her eyes starlike beneath
the- woven massy sunlight of her hair;
and she stared steadfastly before her.
temporarily unconscious of her surround-
ings. thoughts astray and sounding the
iridescent depths of the dreamlike days
to come. .

  Brentwick had slid forward in his
chair, resting his white head on its
back, and was smiling serenely up at
the low yellow ceiling. Presently he
roused, caught Kirkwood's eye, and
smiled. The young man grinned.

  “ And you did all that! " he comment-
ed. amused.

   Brentwick nodded, self-satisfied.

   " r contrived it all.” said he. “ Rather
neat, I call it. too.” His eyes brightened
youthfully with the light of pleasure.

  '‘Inspiration!” he cried. “Inspira-
tion pure and simple! I’d been nagging
my brain for fully five minutes before
Wotton told me about their engaging a
motor-car. and then, in a flash. I had it.
You see. I happened to know Charles—
his name, by the way, is really Charles—
and 1 telephoned Scotland Yard and ar-
ranged all the details with him.”

  He chuckled with delight.

     It's the instinct! " he told Kirkwood
emphatically—“ the instinct for adven-
ture. I knew I had it, but never until this
day did it have a chance to prove its ex-
istence.

  “ A born adventurer—that's what I
am!'” he crowed. You see, we had to
get them to believe that we were afraid
and running away; then they'd run after
us. 1 might have baited a dozen traps
and failed to lure them into my house
after that stout scoundrel knew you had
had time to tell me the whole story. The
minute you mentioned the name of Cal-
endar, 1 began to understand. Odd ! ”
He lapsed suddenly into reverie, the
wistful, whimsical look coming back into
his eves, replacing the glow of excite-
ment. And he sighed faintly.

  “ What I don't understand,” said
Kirkwood, shaking his head, “ is how you
forced Calendar to withdraw his charge
against Dorothy, here.”

  "Oh-h?" Mr. Brentwick elevated his
fine white eyebrows, smiled again, and
sat up.

     I can answer you best, perhaps,” said
he. “ by asking you to scan what 1 sub-

mitted to his respectful consideration, my
dear sir.”

  And he delicately thrust the slip of
cardboard toward Kirkwood. It proved
an ordinary oblong of cream-colored
paper, engraved in fine script. Simply a
visiting-card, something like the follow-
ing:

  MR. GEORGE BURGOYNE CALENDAR

                    25, Asptn Gardens. S. W.

  “ Oh! ” said the young man blankly.
“ You-”

  " I,” assented “ Mr. Brentwick." la-
conically.

  Impulsively Kirkwood leaned across
the table.

  “Dorothy!” he said gently. And
when the girl turned and her dreaming
eyes met his, he quietly drew her atten-
tion to the card.

  Then he rose hastily and went over
and stood by the window, staring out into
the night.

  “My dear—my dear!” protested the
old gentleman. “ Positively. I don’t de-
serve this! I don’t. I-The young-

old voice quavered and broke into a happy

  Kirkwood swung about from the win*
dow. The old gentleman was standing
with his arm around his daughter's shoul-
der.

  “ Come here, Mr. Kirkwood." he sug-
gested pleasantly; “ a word with you,
sir.”

  Kirkwood obeyed slowly.

   “ Dorothy,” said her father, “ the word
is really to you. not to Philip. My dear,
you did a very brave thing a little while
ago—a very brave, womanly, noble, and
creditable action. And Philip’s words
were only second to yours. I do hope to
goodness that you two young idiots are
not going to let any addle-pated scruples
stand between you and happiness! ”

  Abruptly he dropped his arm from
about her shoulders and hopped nimbly
to the door. “ Really. I must see about
that petrol! ” he cried. “ It’s true that
Charles lied, but we really must be get-
ting on! ”

  And the door slammed.

  The table was between them. Across
it the girl stood, head erect, lips firm and
sweet, moisture gleaming on the lashes of

the eyes with which she met his question-
ing gaze so fearlessly.

  The silence deepened about them.
Breathlessly, fascinated, Kirkwood bent
toward her.

  “Vou—Dorothy! You meant it?”
She laughed, a little, low, sobbing
laugh. “ I meant it, my dear—if you’ll
have a girl so bold and forward, who
doesn’t wait till she’s asked, but throws
herself at the head of the man she loves.
I meant it all, Philip.”

  And as he came swiftly around the
table she turned to meet him, arms up-
raised. scarlet lips atremble, the brown
adorable lashes drooping over her divine
and serenely childlike eyes.

  After a while Kirkwood laughed aloud.
And there was that in his voice that
caused the Shape of Care, which had for
the past ten minutes been luffing and fill-
ing in the offing, and steadily diminishing
and growing more emaciated and pale
and indistinct—there was that in his
laugh. I say, which caused the Shape of
Care to utter a hollow croak of despair
and incontinently vanish.

AFTER MIDNIGHT.

    By William Hamilton Osbourne.

 H°w love, when hunting; for
 a disagreeable possibility,
 unearthed a happy actuality. J-

JG. W. OGLETHORPE, of Riv-
     erside Drive, took a firm hold

  •	on the coat-lapel of his friend
Tommy Rogers and dragged
him into one of the small private rooms
in the Millionaires’ Club, on the Avenue.

  “Tommy.” said old J. C.. W. Ogle-
thorpe. “ I’m up against it. and you’ve
got to'help me out—just you and no one
else. It's—it’' about Annette."

  “Measles?” queried Tommy Rogers.

  “Measles!” snorted J. G. \Y.: “T
guess you haven't seen Annette for about
ten years. It's worse than measles.

  “ She's grown up into a young woman.
  Tommy, and-”

“A-ha!" responded Tommy: “and
there’s a man in the case. I see. A-ha!"

 “ You’ve hit the nail on the head,
 Tommy.” answered the old millionaire:
 “ it's almost a—man.”

 “ Who is lie?” queried J. G. W.’s old
 crony. The millionairefleaned forward
 and tapped Tommy’s old and bony knee.

 “ That’s what I want you to find out,
 lad.” he said.

 Rogers sat up.

 “ D-don't she know?” he asked.

 “ She knows all I know, though she
 thinks she knows a heap more. She
 knows his name. 11 is name." he added.
 “ is John Thatcher Wing. He’s a
 society lad—or something worse. I
 want to know. I’ve got to be shown.

 “ You know, I married one of An-

nette’s sisters to the Count -d'Angelo—
a pig in a poke; and another to Whit-
tingham, of London, a member of
Parliament. You know about those
chaps, and what they cost me, and their
habits and proclivities are public prop-
erty.

  “ Well, I’ve just about quit. This
time it's up to me not to make mistakes,
nor will I let Annette make any.”

  Tommy Rogers toddled out into the
corridor and returned with a fat direc-
tory under his arm. But J. G. W. shook
his head.

  " He’s a society boy, I tell you,
Roger," he said, " and all you'll find in
there will be his name and residence
address. He lives at the Watkins Arms.
That's all.”

  “ On Forty-Third Street,” assented
Tommy Rogers.

  “ You look him up, Tommy, will you?
You know why? I can't go to a detective
agency, and I won’t go to a mercantile
reporter. If I do, it's bound to leak out
somehow. I’ve got to trust to you.

  “ I don’t care a hang how fancy the
man is if he’s decent and honest. If
Annette wants him and he wants An-
nette, I don’t care whether he’s a butcher
or a bricklayer. But he’s got to be
straight. He can be a Willie, if he wants
to, but he can’t be crooked. Not if he’s
to deal with me. You’re on? Tommy,
you find out. When you find out, it’ll
be terrapin and champagne on me.”

  Now, there was nothing that Tommy
Rogers liked so much as a mission of this
kind.

  He was a man-about-town, was Tom-
my Rogers, with his little independent
income and nothing to do; he had been
the same old two-and-sixpence for thirty-
seven years of his natty adult life.

   Fie called next morning at the Watkins
Arms and asked for Mr. John Thatcher
Wing. He would not have known that
gentleman had he seen him. But he
was not likely to see him, either.

  Mr. John Thatcher Wing, he was in-
formed politely, never rose before 2 p.m..
except on special occasions, when he
arose at 1 p.m. Would Mr. Rogers
leave his card? He would. He accord-
ingly left the card of a Brooklyn man
whom nobody knew, then strolled back
to the club and reported.

-	“By George," said old J- G. W.,
“ that fits in with what I’ve heard. This
Wing will go to picnics, lectures,
matinees—anything, so long as it’s in the
afternoon. Yet when he talks to me it’s
always about the money market—the
details of it; you understand.

  “ Yet he’s never on the Street—never.
And there’s not a broker down there
knows him, either, that I’ve been able to
find out. He gets up at two, eh? Well,
what time does he go to bed? ”

  " I reserved that inquiry for to-
morrow," answered Tommy Rogers,
slow and sure. “ I’ll see an elevator-boy,
with a bit of a tip.”

  The next day he found out. Mr. John
Thatcher Wing went to bed at seven in
the morning.

  “Does he come home drunk?” he
inquired.

  “Sober as a judge,” responded the
well-tipped elevator-boy. For further
information the elevator-boy referred
Mr. Tommy Rogers to the clerk. The
clerk had no information to give.

  “ Rules o’ the house, you know,” the
clerk remarked.

   “ I’ll tell you what you do,” said J. G.
W. to Rogers on the following day;
“ you come up to my place to-night.
We’ll have billiards, and some good
cigars.

  “ It’s dollars to doughnuts this Wing
chap will be there. He and Annette
seem to be traveling .in converging lines.
It’s getting serious. When he leaves our
place, you follow him, Tommy. What
do you think of that?”

  That suited Tommy.

  He was on time that evening. And so
was Wing. But the two men did not
meet. Tommy caught a glimpse of him
through the curtains.

  “ Looks all right,” he said, “ but you
can never tell. If I’d had time I’d
have brought a pair of sneakers, and a set
o’ nippers, and—and things."

  “ ou're too old for a good detective,
Tommy," said the old millionaire. “ Be-
sides, there’s the front door closing. It’s
Wing. He’s gone. Get into your duds
and follow him at once.”

  Rogers followed him. Wing went, al-
most as the crow flies, down to his rooms
in the Watkins Arms, and disappeared
within. Old Rogers sneaked up in an

elevator and ened at Wing's door.
There was a light within, bat there were
no voices.

  Now and then he heard Wing hum-
ming a soft little song under his breath.
S Tommy Rogers defended, and loi-
tered about the hal! and in the street
unit! fifteen minutes to twelve: and then
he left.

  “ To-night, evidently," thought Ro-
gers. “ he's piawn' a straight game. I
guess."

  His views might have changed had he
known that at five minutes to twelve
o’clock Mr. John Thatcher Wing
emerged from his rooms ;Lid in « dark
business soit, with a sioach-haz upon
his bead.

  He did not know that Mr. Wing de-
fended in the elevator and made his
way through the rear of the building into
an alleyway connecting Forty-Third with
F^-rty-Second Street and disappeared.

  As regular as clockwork, however. Mr.
John Thatcher Wing reappeared at the
Watkins Arms at 7 a.m. ne~: day. nodded
to the clerk and went to bed.

  In the home of J. G. W. Oglethorpe
a crisis was approaching.

  Annette sobbed upon her father's
shoulder.

  •' He wants to marry me.” she pro-
tested: '‘and besides. I want to marry
him.'

  The millionaire raised his eyebrows.

  “ Annette." he said. " would you marry
a man like D'Angeio. to-day? "

  "No." exclaimed the horrified An-
nette.

    Or—Whittingham ? "

  *■ Nc." repeated Annette.

   *' My dear." said the millionaire softly,
“how much more do you know about
this Wing than your sisters knew about
the other two? "

    John Thatcher Wing's a gentleman."
replied Annette loftily.

  “ '' hat's his business?" queried her
father. " Does he live on his money?
Is he rich?”

  “ N -no,” returned Annette, ‘‘he isn't
rich, and he isn't poor."

  “ And—his business? "

  ■■ I don’t know." returned Annette.
~ and I won't ask him. He’s never told
me. We don't talk f’ustnsss." she re-
turned emphatically.

  " You r«n away. Annette.” said the
old gentleman, " and when we find out
we’ll talk it over. If he’s a gentleman,
all right. If he isn't-

  " He is" exclaimed Annette.

  “ Tommy." said J. G. W. to his crony,
that evening. " I don’t like this night

Tommy. I'm old-fashioned, I am. And
when I was young I had to be in by
ten o'clock.

  ■' If I wasn't. Mama Oglethorpe would
be in my wool, all right, cr Papa Ogle-
thorpe would be busy—elsewhere—with
a stick. And when I married Annette's
mother she kept it up. I haven't ever
been able to stay out ail night. Why
should hi? Is he an hotel clerk? No.
Because he makes too much money for
an hotel clerk. He isn't a butcher, or
a bricklayer—his hands show that.

  " No. Tommy, it's deeds of darkness
that are done in the night. I tell yon.
This chap Wing doesn't have anv inde-
pendent income. We know that. If
he did. he’d come home woozy at seven
in the morning. He makes his money
between twelve at night ana sever, in the
morning: he does it in a -lear-headed
way. too.

  " There's only one thing left. Tommy.

 For a whole week Tommy Rogers
vratched. Three times he saw his mar:

disappear.

  “ Confound it," thought the old mil-
lionaire. '" I'm in for a scene of scan:

for a year or more. If I ask him about

  His opportunity came sooner than he
had expected. It came that evening. It
was fully 11 p.m. when Annette«*called
him into the parlor.

  There was J ohn Thatcher Wing.

  “ Mr. Oglethorpe,” Wing began, and
his voice trembled, “ 1 am acting under
the instructions of Annette, your—your
daughter. She told me to—to ask you,

right here, in her presence-" He

stopped.

  The millionaire waited patiently.

  “ Well, ask me," he said. “ Why don’t
you ask me? I’m here.”

  “ Oh, to be sure,” answered the red-
faced John Thatcher Wing. “ I’ll ask
you—for Annette,”

  Then his face paled.

  The millionaire cleared his throat.

  “ Sit down,” he said. J ohn Thatcher
Wing sat down. But first he took his
watch from his pocket and looked at it.

  The millionaire sparred for time. He
started in on a desultory conversation
that began with the weather and threat-
ened never to let up. At last John
Thatcher Wing rose to his feet, once
more drew forth his timepiece, and
stammered:

  “ And—about Annette,” he said.

  “ By George,” he thought to himself,
“ I'll be late if I don’t look out.”

  “ Th-thursday," spluttered the mil-
lionaire. for an idea had occurred to him
—“ Th-thursday I'll give you my answer.
G-good night, sir.”

  J. G. W. Oglethorpe stumbled over
himself in leaving the room. But once
in the billiard-room, he wasted no time.
He called up his stable and ordered his
motor-car around at once.

  In the hall. John Thatcher Wing took
a hasty hut significant adieu of Annette
and sped down the steps. “ I’ll have to
get a cab,” he told himself; "that old
duffer kept me so long.”

  He did not know that the “old
duffer" had' directed his daughter to
wrap up in her duds and to come on,
now. no nunsensi:—he’d show her. Wing
did not know that a motor-car was fol-
lowing his cab, up one street, down an-
other.

  “ Oh. yes." thought the old million-
aire. ” I’ll give him his answer before
he knows it—and so will Annette.”
Wing’s cab trailed on in front.

  " I won’t have time to go home," he
muttered to himself, so he stuck his head
out and uttered a brief direction to his
cabman, who nodded. Then he kept on,
and swung his horse into Forty-Second
Street.

  John Thatcher Wing leaped out in
front of an attractively lighted place—a
place that at that hour seemed to beckon
to all the midnight world—and disap-
peared within.

  The motor-car pulled up behind him.
The old millionaire saw nothing but the
glitter of the lights.

  “ Now, girl,” he said to Annette
fiercely, for the recollection of D’Angelo
and of Whittingham was fresh within
him, “ you come with me. I’ll show you.
no matter what the cost.”

  He pulled her—dragged her—behind
him. Together they slowly ascended the
steps of the glittering palace.

  Inside, John Thatcher Wing stepped
through swinging doors. Then he flung
off his overcoat and looked at his watch.

  “ On time to the minute,” he said.
“ It’s just twelve. Now you can go,
old chap.”

  The old chap looked up.

  “ Got your togs on. Wing. I see,” he
said.

  He passed on out, brushing against an
old man and a girl as he went. But the
old man and the girl bustled in, never-
theless, one unwillingly, the oilier with
determination.

  John Thatcher Wing caught sight of
them as they came along. He opened
a little gate and invited them inside an
enclosure.

  " To what,” he exclaimed with a smile
—a businesslike smile, “ do I owe the
honor of this visit ? ”

  J. G. W. Oglethorpe puffed himself
up.

  " I told you, young man.” he said se-
verely, " that I would give you your
answer Thursday. Your answer, sir—
or mine—is ready. Yes, sir. You can
have her. sir. You can take her.

  “ I couldn’t wait till Thursday to tell
you. And neither could Annette. My
answer, sir, is ‘ yes,’ and good luck go
with you."

  He went back to the motor-car while
John Thatcher Wing and Annette did the
rest. But Annette was puzzled.
THE PACKING-CASE.	701

  “What is this place?” she asked of
Wing, “ and why didn’t you ever tell
me?"

  “ I never told you, dear," said John
Thatcher Wing, 11 because you never
asked, and I suppose you never cared.
But I’ll tell you now. For the present

CHAPTER I.

A GRUESOME JOKE.

THE clock of St. Luke’s was
chiming the second quarter after
midnight when I turned into
Tedworth Street.

  It was the first night of my first play,
and after the excitement of my “ call.”
and the congratulations afterward, when
everybody conspired to make me believe
that I had done something very wonder-
ful. I had welcomed the idea of a long
walk home, and was only sorry that the
distance between the theater and my
chambers on Chelsea Embankment was
not twice as great.

  I knew that I should not sleep, when
I had only to close my eyes to see again
the serried rows of faces which had
seemed to mass themselves into one vague
white glare in the moment that I stood
before the curtain, when my ears rang
still with the deafening roar of applause
that had greeted me.

  I hat’ consciously begun to loiter by
the time I auproached Tedworth Street,
which is a mere double row of back
_,ardenf without a single hoi’se facing on
it, for beyonc- lay tlu Embankment and
my chambers, snc * did not want to go
in yet.

  Then as I turned into the street my
steps arrested themselves altogether.

Night Bank of New York City. Don’t
you see? "

  When J, G. W. Oglethorpe and Tom-
my Rogers had that dinner the All-
Night Bank of New York City was rep-
resented at it, too.

  “ My son-in-law, sir,” said J. G. W.
to Tommy—“ my son-in-law—to be.”

  Some twenty or thirty yards down it.
two men, showing dimly in the light of
the street-lamps, appeared to be carrying
an oblong wooden case from the door of
one of the gardens to a hand-truck stand-
ing by the curb. Indistinct as the whole
scene was, it was evident from the men's
movements that their burden was one of
considerable weight. The lamplight
shcjwed nothing clearly, except the white-
wood case.

  It was no doubt an ordinary packing-
case, and but for the lateness of the
:iour and the dramatic tend of my own
thoughts I do not suppose I should have
found myself associating its dimensions
with those of a coffin or, indeed, should
have felt any curiosity over an incident
ihat in the daytime would have appeared
quite commonplace.

  As the box was placed on the truck
one of the men turned his face toward
me, and it seemed to me that the sight
of my approach made them hasten.
Whether it was so or not, they certainly
acted with a surprising celerity. By the
time I had taken the few steps necessary
to come abreast of them one man had
reentered the garden, closing the door
behind him, and the other had set off al
a rapid pace down the street, wheeling
the truck, with its burden, before him.

  I was in two minds whether to follow
him and see where he took it or to mind

my own business. I was standing now
just where the men had been, but the tall
brick garden wall, with its closed wooden
door, made it impossible tor me to see
anything of the house from which they
had come.

  A real estate agent’s board overhang-
ing the wall announced that tbe place
was to let, and my suspicion that die
house was an empty one enabled me to
find a somewhat sordid explanation of
what I had seen. I had little doubt
that the men were engaged in some un-
lawful enterprise, but at the worst it was
probably that of the humble house-
stripper who, lacking the enterprise and
daring needed for burglary, devotes him-
self to the more arduous and less re-
munerative work of robbing empty
houses of such trifles as window-fittings
and lead piping.

  This would account for the heaviness
of their load- and f felt a little ashamed
of the tragic suspicion with which I had
let it fill my mind. I had allowed the
cigarette I had been smoking as I turned
into the street to go oat. I now stopped
to relight it.	—

  As I struck a match, all my excite-
ment returned with redoubled force. For
the light from the match had shown me
something glistening on the pavement
just in front of me. In a moment I was
bending down over it with another light-
ed match in my hand, to find that the
glistening spot which had caught my eye
was not alone.

  Fran the gate in tbe wail to the curb
where the hand-truck had stood ran a
regular succession of them—great drops
of wet blood.

  All my indecision wi< at an end. and
with a last look at the doer in the wall
to assure myself that I could recognize
it again. I set off at a run in pursuit of
the man with the truck.

  He was just turning the corner in the
direction of the Embankment, and he,
too, must have begun to run. 1 think,
as soon as the corner was turned, for by
the time I reached the Embankment he
was still some considerable distance in
advance of me. But it was easy to gain
ob hiny-when he bad such a considerable
weight to push before him. and I slack-
ened my pace.

  I do not think I am lacking in courage

or in public-spiritedness, but although I
had no doubt that a crime had been com-
mitted, I did not see that I was called
upon to try and capture the .perpetrator
single-handed, especially as I was quite
unarmed and had a very special reason
for wishing to be alive when the morn-
ing's papers were on sale.

  So I followed the truck at a set distance
until at the bottom of Tite Street, where
the fortune I had prayed to favored me
and I caught sigh: of a burly policeman
coming down.

  He had not seen the man with the
truck passing, and I was quite conscious
that he did not believe me when I panted
out that a murder had bc-en committed
and I was following the murderer carry-
ing away his victim's body, but when I
got him out into the roadway under the
trees the truck was still in sight, and a
man wheeling a truck after midnight is
always an object of suspicion, so C n-
stable Smith, as I learned to call him
later, consented to trot after it, with me,
in pursuit.

  The man in advance broke into a trot
also, and put an end to my new ally's
half- heart edness.

  “ He can’t get far with that barrow
to push,” he panted, as we ran abreast,
and I could tell from the tone that his
heart was in die chase.

  But with the best intendons in the
world, an English policeman cann-.t ran.
His dress is against it, 3s much as his
habit of perpetual strolling, and I had
soon outstripped him. I was almost upon
our quarry when, with another quick
glance behind him, he dung down the
handle of the truck, and leaving its
grimly suggestive load to look after itself,
ran on unimpeded.

  1 had been wondering why he had not
done so before, when it was so evident
that we were overtaking him. and I had
already decided that it was the man we
wanted. The packing-case could wait,
and I passed it without pausing.

  It was a race of man against man now,
but it seemed to me that the fugitive
was already exhausted, while I was just
wanning up to the chase. Before he
could run another fifty yards. I was
abreast of him. and caught at his arm.

proportion, and I was on the lookout for
a knife or other weapon.

  But the poor devil seemed past re-
sistance.

  He turned and faced me. panting pain-
fully for breath. Instead of running
straight forward, he had taken a diagonal
course to the sidewalk nearest the river,
and it was just under one of the Embank-
ment lamps that we stood and faced each
other for a moment in silence.

  I was conscious of a surprise none the
less great because it was. 1 suppose,
quite uncalled for. I had taken it for
granted that I was pursuing a low-class
scoundrel, and the man who faced me
was certainly not low-class.

  He was dressed very quietly, but his
serge suit had the unmistakable cut of
a good tailor. His' face, with its keen
black eyes, aquiline nose, bushy black
mustache, aud prominent chin, struck
me. in spite of the terror and distress it
showed, as almost the typical face of the
successful banker or lawyer. It seemed,
indeed, vaguely familiar to me as a face
I had come across in the illustrated
journals.

  He was the first to speak, and I was
prepared to find his voice confirming my
new impression of him. He was des-
perately short of breath, as I was. too,
hut the sight of the policeman trotting
like an overfed poodle toward us stirred
him to a desperate effort of bluff.

  “ Well! and what can I do for you? "
he panted, and I was really taken aback
by the admirably acted tone, which
abruptly seemed to make me. and not
himself, the person wh se duty it was to
explain his extraordinary conduct. His
voice was that of a man accustomed to
speak with authority.

  “ You can come A>ack and show me
what you have‘got in that packing-case."
I ssidL

effrontery. “ I was wheeling it home for
a wager, and as one of the conditions
was that nobody should stop me or ask
what I was doing, you can have the
satisfaction of knowing that you have
lost me a ten-pound note.'’

  I nodded as though I believed him.

  " And may I ask why your old books
drip blood?” I demanded, and watched
the last desperate hope forsake him.

  He had been red in patches with his
running, and beads of perspiration still
stood on his forehead, but his face now
became white all over. He uttered a
groan—the groan of a man who is faint-
ing—and I suppose the tight grip with
which I had not ceased to hold him
relaxed for a moment.

  And in that moment, when I thought
he would faint dead away, he wrenched
his arm suddenly free and darted off'
with a suddenness and agiliry for which
I was wholly unprepared. He was
twenty yards away, running alongside the
Embankment wall, before I recovered
from my surprise to start in pursuit.

  But he was already flagging. His
feet stumbled uncertainly, and I did not
exert myself to the utmost as I ran after
him. I was sorry, afterward, that I was
not quicker, because I might have
reached him in time to avert the tragedy.
I never anticipated it until I saw him
begin to clamber awkwardly over the
Embankment wall, and as it was. my
hand was within a foot of his boot when
he dropped over clumsily into the
water.

  The tide had passed the full and was
running out rapidly to sea, and by the
time I had managed to get a glimpse of
him in the darkness he had been carried
a dozen yards down the stream and far-
ther out from the bank. He did not
seem to be making any attempt t” swim,
and sank, for the second time. I suppose,
almost as 1 caught sight of him.

   It is not a pleasant thing to see a man
drovrn. whatever he may be. 3nd it turned

  He hesitated for just one moment, and
1 could see that he was deciding whether
to disown his connection with the pack-
ing-case altogether. The lie would have
been too paltry, when I had not once
lost sight of him since he abandoned
the truck, and he no doubt realized the
fact.

  “ Oh! the packing-case? That contains
a lot of old book- that I have purchased
front a friend,’’ he said, with admirable

me sick to think th3t with a little more
quickness I might have prevented it.
Then I remembered that there were life-
buoys hung here and there along the
Embankment ready for use. and I had
turned excitedly to seek one. when I met
Constable Smith trotting up breathlessly
with a life-buoy already in his hand.

  We satisfied our excitement by dan-
gling ii as nearly as we could above the
place where 1 had seen the man disap-
pear. but as we never got another glimpse
of him. and I doubt very much whether
we could have thrown the life-buoy to
him if we had, it took little more than
ten minutes to satisfy us that we •vere
wasting our time and that he must be
given up as dead.

  It was with a strange mingling of
morbid curiosity and humane concern
that I remembered the packing-case
which he had left at our mercy, and we
made our way back to where it stood as
tbe suicide had abandoned it.

  The Embankment seemed to be wholly
deserted. I had seen nobody there since
my pursuit of the hand-truck began, ex-
cept the policeman, and although con-
scious of a responsibility more weighty
than he was accustomed to. he had blown
his whistle more than once for reinforce-
ments. the summons had not as yet
brought even a curious night-bird to join
in our deliberations.

  I had taken it for granted that we
should break open the case and satisfy
our curiosity as to its contents at once,
but I was disappointed to find that it did
not agree with my companion's idea of
police routine, even when I showed him
an unmistakable stain of blood on tbe
under side of the case, where it had evi-
dently oozed out between two loosely
fitting boards.

  “ For all we know, tbe body may have
life in it still.” I argued excitedly, when
he protested that the opening of the case
was too serious a matter for us to under-
take on our own responsibility, and that
we must wait till we reached the police
station.

  “ And suppose it is not dead, are you
a doctor? ” he demanded, and I had to
admit that I was not.

  “ Then 1 do not see what good you
would do," he said. “ And 1 don't know
wbetheT you have a cliiscl in your pocket,
but I kr,, w I have nothing to prize the
lid off with if I wanted to."

  Tbe second argument, at least, was
effective, especially as I had not so much
as a penknife in my pocket.

  " Then, iet os hurry up and get it to
the station." 1 said, breathlessly " We
ought not to lose a minute-'’

  But again I was opposed by the con-
stable's desire to consider all proper for-
mality.

  “ I should get a reprimand, or worse,
it I left here without giving the river
police notice of the drowning. s< that
they can start dragging for the body,”
he said, and blew his whistle again.

  Fortunately, it was answered this time
by one of his colleagues from Grosvenor
Road, and after what seemed to me an in-
terminable delay, while Smith explained
the affair, pointed out the exact spot
where the fugitive had jumped into the
water, and arranged that be should in-
form the river men. we started for the
police station, in King’s Road.

  I lent a hand to the work, and man-
aged to keep my companion trotting most,
of tbe way.

  I was consumed by a fever of impa-
tience. Apart from my curiosity. I was
still counting on the chance that instead
of merely detecting a murder I might
be the means of saving a life. The pack-
ing-case was too roughly put together to-
be anything' like air-tight. If a body
had been placed in it before death had
actually occurred it was possible that
when the box was opened at the police
station life might not be extinct, and
although my stout companion was pant-
ing remonstrances all the way. I did
not allow the pace to slacken until we
were at our destination.

  In Kings Road there were still a few
people about, and we had a little crowd
with us by the time we reached the sta-
tion door.

  There seemed another interminable
delay while Constable Smith gave his
report and I was put through some sort
of examination: but at last the packing-
case was on tbe flagged floor of the
charge-room and tools were brought to
unscrew the lid. Even then they seemed
to me painfully deliberate; it was neces-
sary to note everything, and to cause as
little d-sturbance to the case as possible,
since the slightest detail might be useful
as evidence later on.

  Besides myself there were half a dozen
men in the room, all policemen, to whom,

I suppose, tragedy was not the rare,
strange th;ng that it was to me. But
I believe they were ail tensely interested
as tbe lid was opened.
THE PACKING-CASE

705

  At the top was a layer of earth inter-
>pt*rs'ed with old bricks, which two of
the men took out carefully and deliber-
ately, until, when the box was half
empty, the man in command suggested, a
little impatiently, that it should be placed
on its side. Earth and bricky came rat-
tling out together, and at the Bottom of
the case, where the stain of blood was
visible, the body of a lean, half-starved
cat with its throat cut appeared. There
was nothing else in the box.

  There whs a moment's dead silence.
The faces of the ordinary constables were
terribly solemn, the more so because that
of the chief was scarlet with anger.

   “ It is all a silly, practical joke, I sup-
pose," he said sharply, and glared at me.

  For an instant I had almost thought of
it as one myself, until there flashed back
to my mind a vivid remembrance of the
terror and despair written on the face of
the man facing me on the Embankment.

  “If it is a practical joke.” I said
gravely, “ it is a joke for which one man
has been willing to give up his life.”

CHAPTER II.

THE QUICK AND THE DEAD.

  Ik all my thoughts of the mystery of
the packing-case, which the discovery of
its contents had only made more baffling
and exciting to me, I had more or less
consciously looked forward to having my
curiosity satisfied fully only when t re-
turned to the house in Tedworth Street
which, I felt. I had been too precipitate
in considering uninhabited.

  It would be when the police made in-
quiries there. I had told myself, that one
would get some facts to work upon, and
I had sufficient faith in my own deduc-
tive power to think that a few facts were
all I needed to make an intelligible
theory out of the strange happenings I
had seen.

  “If you made some inquiry at the
house from which I saw the packing-
case taken," I said, with every show of
diffidence to the angry and suspicious
police inspector, “ perhaps it would en-
able us to understand why this apparent-
ly practical joke has been played."

  The great man eyed me contemptu-
ously. -

  •	9 S

  “ On what grounds can we make in-
quiries? ’’ he asked. " A man has a per-
fect right to kill as mSnv cats as he
pleases, and cart them all over London
if he chooses. It is not a matter for
police investigation or interference unless
the owners of the cats apply to us."

  To my surprise, Constable Smith, who
had scarcely ceased to pant and mop his
perspiring face, came to my assistance.

  “ It will be necessary, won’t it. sir,”
he suggested, “ to call at the house to
inform them of the deceased gentleman’s
suicide and establish his identity? ”

  The inspector grunted.

  “ That is a different matter, if you are
sure that there has been a suicide.-’

  I hastened to assure him that the sui-
cide, at least, was genuine. I had seen
the man sink without making any attempt
to swim. It seemed to me absolutely im-
possible that he could have saved himself
afterward while I was seeking the life-
buoy.

  The inspector was not so sure. He
seemed to imagine that the desperate man
I had faced on the Embankment had not
only given himself a great deal of
trouble and exertion in filling and wheel-
ing the packing-case, but had also taken
a midnight dive, fully dressed, into a
dangerous current for the single purpose
of making the police force ridiculous,
and I believe he more than half suspected
that I was an accomplice in the plot.

  But Constable Smith was fortunately
as emphatic as I was in declaring that the
man was drowned, and the debate ended
in his being told off to make inquiries at
the house in Tedworth Street, in order
to establish the identity of the suicide.
It was necessary for me to accompany
him, to point out the particular door
from which I had seen the packing-case
carried, and although I should have done
so in any case, I was not sorry to have a
sort of official right to take part in his
investigations.

  I felt a thrill of anticipation, not un-
connected with the expectation of per-
sonal danger, as we stepped out again
into the deserted streets. I had tried to
persuade the inspector to give us another
man, but he would not make even that
much admission that there was anything
more than an ordinary case of suicide to
Investigate.

N»
TO.

THE ALL-STORY MAH AZIN I!

  “ We can only deal with facts, not
with theories. Mr. Herbert,” he said to
me, as though he were saying some-
thing sensible and dignified.

  But it seemed to me that the, theories
he dismissed so contemptuously were of
some importance to Constable Smith and
myself, when they offered us the only
means of guessing what reception we
were going to receive in Tedworth
Street.

  I returned to them as soon as we had
started on our quest.

  “ I never doubted for a moment—after
the man ran away—that there was a mur-
dered human being in that box. Did
sou. sir? ” Smith was saying, as he suited
his pace to that of easy and confidential
conversation.

  "Not for a moment." I said; “and
what is more, I am perfectly certain that
the fellow who was wheeling it never
doubted that there was a murdered body
in it. He has been fooled, in some way.
by the people in the house we are going
to. If there has not been a murder—
and they may have had some reason of
their own for keeping the body—at any
rate there has been a conspiracy to mur-
der. and it will take pretty skilful ques-
tioning to get anything out of them.
How do you propose to set to work? "

  Constable Smith had more imagina-
tion than I had at first given him credit
for. The idea his chief seemed to have,
that he had allowed himself to lie made
a fool of over the packing-case, when he
had so patently done no more than his
duty, rankled within him, and I found
him as ready as I was to prove to his
superior that he was treating the affair
too lightly.

  We discussed a plan of campaign as
we walked, and were still engaged on it
when we reached the scene of operations.

  I had no difficulty in recognizing the
door through which 1 had seen the box
carried, and to make my recognition cer-
tain. the constable’s lamp showed the
dotted line of blood across the pavement.

  The door was locked, and Smith
pulled the bell-handle at the side only
to find it broken.

  He looked up at the notice-board.

  “If I remember rightly, the house is
an empty one—been empty for months.”
he said. “ Let’s go round to the front.”

  The front of the houses were in an-
other street, and we counted the garden
doors from the corner, to make sure of
locating the one we wanted.

  It was called Erdenshaw House, and
in each of its blank uncurtained windows
was a bill announcing that the place was
to let. From its air of neglect, it might
well have been unoccupied for the best
part of a year, as Smith averred. But
we went through the form of trying
the door and sounding a summons on
bell and knocker.

  As the sound' died away unanswered
we stood and looked at each other a lit-
tle blank ly.

  “ Well! I should like to have a
glance at that back garden,” I said. “ I
could manage to get over the wall, with
your assistance.”

  So back we went to Tedworth Street,
and in a few moments I was dropping
down from the high wall into the dark-
ness of the garden. 1'he door was for-
tunately bolted—not locked—and I had
no difficulty in opening it and admitting
my companion.

  His bull’s-eye lantern played on an
uncultivated waste that might once have
been a garden, but showed no sign of
vegetation now beyond a few chimps of
rank grass and weeds. In one corner
there had probably at some distant date
been a rockery, and it was here, to all
appearance, that the packing-case had
been filled, for the heap of earth and
bricks had been recently disturbed. We
bent over the spot,- examining it care-
fully, and came to the conclusion that
the ballast for the box had been dug
out by hand.

  But it was really all that the garden
had to tell us, carefully as we investi-
gated every foot of it. The house was as
well secured at the back as in front, and
I doubted whether the conspirators had
entered it at all. or had any connection
with it.

  My companion was copying down in
his note-book the name and address of
the real estate agent who had the letting
of the house, but it seemed to me that
the place had ceased to have any impor-
tance as a clue. I said so to the con-
stable.

  “ Then we can only wait until the
body is recovered from the river, sir?”
THE PACKING-CASE.

he questioned, with disappointment in
his voice.

  I,	too, should have been .disappointed
if 1 had been compelled to take no fur-
ther active part in the elucidation of the
mystery.

  " I should like to have a look at that
truck at the station," I said. “ I never
thought of noticing whether there was
a name on it.”

  Constable Smith had not thought of
noticing, either, and his face brightened
as he assured me that a liand-truck with-
out the owner’s name on it was quite a
rarity.

  Letting him out of the garden, I
bolted the door again, and clambered up
it and over the wall, as I have no doubt
its last occupant had done.

  We walked back to the station, build-
ing new hopes on the clue that the truck
might give us. It might even discover
for us the identity of the second man,
which was of even more importance to
us than that of the suicide.

  But at the police station I found
awaiting me a reception even more cold-
ly suspicious than before. The inspector
laughed aloud at our report. So we had
actually discovered that some earth and
old bricks might have been removed
from the place where the packing-case
was filled?

  “ We are not investigating the death
of a cat, Mr. Herbert,” he said severely
to me. and he refused pointblank to let
me inspect the truck.

  “It is very kind of you to wish to
assist us,” he went on, in his tone of
angry irony, “ but we are quite capable
of conducting our own business.”

  It seemed that the river police had
been telephoning to ask whether there
was any certainty that a man was
drowned. They had found no sign of
the body, and thought Constable Smith
might have made a mistake. Partly as
punishment, he was ordered to report
himself at the floating station and give
them any further details that they re-
quired, if indeed be had actually seen a
man in the water.

  This latter piece of information I re-
ceived from Smith himself after I had
been practically turned out of the place.

  I had loitered about outside on the
chance that he might join me, and met

him starting off on his errand. He had
managed with difficulty to give a rapid
examination to the truck, which now
stood in the station-yard behind, but had
found on it no name or distinctive marks
at all, and it was apparent that he was
feeling blue.

  “ The chief does not believe that there
was a suicide at all,” he said moodily.
“ He thinks the whole thing was a prac-
tical joke, and that if you were not in
it you fancied a good deal more than
happened and stuffed me up. And, of
course, I can’t say that I actually saw
the man in the water. I only caught a
glimpse of him Climbing over the para-
pet.

  “ I am in the chief’s black books till
the body is found, and with the cur-
rent running out strong like that it may
not be found for weeks, or it may not be
found at all. It is a bad lookout for me,
unless you can follow up the clue from
the packing-case, sir.”

  “ There is not much chance of that,
when they won’t even let me see it
again,” I said.

  I was feeling quite disheartened.

  It was now between two and three
o’clock, but if I had felt unprepared for
sleep when I turned the corner of Ted-
worth Street at half past twelve I was
still more wakeful now. I had reached
that state of mental activity when only
continuous action at high pressure seems
satisfying, and abruptly I saw myself
with nothing to do.

  My part in the night's work was
ended, and I shrank from the reaction
that would come when I allowed my-
self to admit the fact. In fear of it, I
even thought of accompanying the con-
stable to his interview with the river
police, but the journey lacked incentive,
since I could tell them no more than
Smith himself, and the chances of their
finding the body that night seemed so
remote.

  So, very reluctantly, I bade my friend
the policeman good night at a point on
the Embankment not far from where we
had first met and turned my face once
more toward home.

  There was no necessity, of course, for
me to pass through Tedworth Street on
my way, but I was reluctant to go in,
and admit that the excitement of the
708

THE AI.I.-STORY MAGAZINE

night was over, so far a- 1 was con-
cerned. and I made a detour to stroll
once more through the quiet thorough-
fare.

   It had been quite silent and deserted
when I visited it with Constable Smith,
but now. as I turned the corner. 1 became
aware that there were other footsteps
than mine breaking the night-silence.

   A man. like myself. in evening dress
was strolling toward me on the opposite
side of the street. The light of a lamp,
as he passed it. showed me his white
shirt-front, but little more, and instinct-
ively I drew farther into the shadow of
the wall to watch him.

   The mere fact that he was in this par-
ticular street of all others at half past
two in the morning made him interest-
ing, and I waited observantly for him
to pass the next lamp. The next lamp
was almost opposite the garden door of
Erdenshaw House. The strangc-r reached
it, and I drew my breath quickly, for
he had stopped and turned toward the
fateful house. I altogether forgot to
breathe, I believe, as he stretched out his
arm and pushed at the door, as if ex-
pecting it to be unlocked. Finding it
firmly secured, he stood a moment, then
stepped out into the road, as if to try
to obtain a view of the house. The
house was not visible from the street, as
I could have told him, and he strolled
on again, crossing to my side of the way.

   More or less instinctively. 1 had been
trying to keep out of sight, but there
was no doubt that he would see me when
he passed, and realizing the fact, I
walked onward openly to the next lamp-
post and waited there, making a pretense
of finding my matches and lighting a
cigarette.

  I watched the approaching figure
keenly as I did so, and I think that I
guessed the exact moment at which he
became aware of my presence in the
street.

  His hand moved to his pocket, and
reminded me again that I was quite un-
armed.

  He was advancing toward me slowly
and, it seemed to me, warily, his hand
still at his pocket, and already, indis-
tinct as the tall, stalwart figure was in
the darkness, it impressed me with a
vague and disquieting feeling of famil-

iarity, which increased as he came nearer.
Then, as lie reached the circle of light
thrown by the street-lamp near which I
had taken up my position, the cigaret^
I had been pretending to light fell from
my lips and 1 had difficulty in restrain-
ing an exclamation.

   For the keen black eyes that met mine,
the aquiline nose, the bushy black mus-
tache and resolute chin, were familiar.

  It was the man whom less than two
hours earlier I had seen throw himself
desperately into the river and sink un-
resistingly in the swiftly ebbing tide.

  He 'Stared at me frankly with a ques-
tioning curiosity, but without the least
sign of recognition, and I saw his face
plainly and clearly.

  It was not distorted now by the ex-
pression of terror and despair I had seen
on the Embankment, but the features
were too striking and characteristic, as
was the figure, also, to allow any change
of expression or of dress to leave me in
a moment’s doubt that it was the man
whom I had been looking on as dead.

  For a moment I thought he was going
to address me, as his keen, searching eyes
met mine: but the next he had passed on.
and I stooped to recover my lost cigar-
ette.

   I took just as long as I wished to find
and light it, and then turned to follow
him.

  I felt completely bewildered, and, I
must admit, a little unnerved: sick with
apprehension in the moment that I
thought he was going to stop and speak.
1 dreaded to find myself at the mercy
of a man who two hours before had been
at mine and had all the agony of hope-
less .terror I had seen on his face to pay-
back.

  It was useless for me to remind my-
self that the apparent suicide must have
been a pretense, and, as a corollary, that
the terror had been a pretense, too. I
could not believe it. If the man I was
slowly following had turned I believe I
should* have taken to my heels and run
*for my life-

  But he continued to walk' on at his
slow, sauntering pace, and I followed
him at a discreet distance, from Ted-
worth Street to the Embankment, where
I had the satisfaction of seeing him turn
into one of the big residential blocks
THE PACKING-CASE

709

within a stone's throw of that in which
my own chambers were situated.

  The whole place was in darkness, and
I waited anxiously to see whether a light
would appear at any of the windows.
When my patience was rewarded by see-
ing a room on the first-floor illuminated,

I felt safe in concluding that I had at
last taken one small step toward eluci-
dating the mystery of the packing-case.

  I had discovered the address of the
principal actor.

  If my friend Constable Smith had been
at hand to give me the support and pro-
tection of the law I should have been
inclined to call on the man at once and
cross-examine him. 11' he had not laid
himself open to a charge of attempted
suicide, we should at least be justified in
asking him what he wished to be done
with a hand-truck and a packing-case
which he had left in our hands.

  The idea of exacting a statement of
any sort from one of the men actually
concerned in the mystery was alluring,
and I was not sorry to remember that I
owed a duty to the river police.

  It was not fair to let them go on drag-
ging for a man. when I had the best rea-
son for knowing that the man was not
drowned. I must go to the floating
station to report what I had seen and
there, or on my way to it along the Em-
bankment, I should see Constable Smith,
and could consult with him as to our
next move.

  As a matter of fact, I met him just
coming out. His face brightened at the
sight of me.

  “ I have news for you,” I said, speak-
ing before he could. “ After all, the
man was not drowned. 1 have seen
him—in Tedworth Street, again, and
found out where he lives."

  Constable Smith stared at me.

  “ I think you have made a mistake,
sir,” he said.

  “A mistake? Why?”

  “ Because they have just found the
body, sir. I was coming to see you about _
it. The inspector wouid like you to say*
whether it is the man we followed with
the hand-truck. You see, sir. 1 never
really saw his face, and it has become
important. The body is at the station,
here, if you will come in.”

  I did not stop to prove to him that it

could not be the body of the man we had
seen. It would be enough to see it and
say that it was not. So I followed him
down the gangway, and in a few more
minutes I had been introduced to the
officials and ushered into the room where
the body had been laid.

   I believe I turned a little faint as I
looked at it. 1 know that the inspector,
who was standing at my side, put out his
hand and held my arm as if to support
me. and that I did not resent the action.

  “ Is that the man that you followed
along the Embankment and whom you
saw throw himself into the river?” he
said, and I nodded.

   “ Yes, that is the man.”

  “ You are quite sure?”

  “ Quite sure. I held him for a mo-
ment just before he jumped in, and I
noticed his face particularly, as well as
this serge suit he is wearing.”

   “ It is very strange,” said the inspec-
tor. “ I do not know whether you have
recognized who it really is—his name. I
mean? ”

  I shook my head.

  .“ You have heard of Sir Caleb Burn-
ham, of course? I recognized him at
once, and so did most of the men, and if
we needed any confirmation the initials
‘ C. B.’ on his clothing."

  Sir Caleb Burnham? I could under-
stand Smith saying that the case had be-
come important. For Sir Caleb Burn-
ham. the Christian company promoter, as
he was called, was one of tiie most prom-
inent figures of the day, and I knew
now why his face had seemed so fam-
iliar to me from the first.

   It was because I had so often seen his
portrait in the religious journals, where
lie was held up as a proof that a finan-
cier can be a devout Christian, and while
making great wealth for himself serve
his fellows by promoting semi-philan-
thropic enterprises ill which it was pos-
sible for the most religiously minded man
to invest his savings with the utmost cer-
tainty that he was using his money for a
good cause besides earning a perfectly
safe seven per cent, guaranteed by the
undoubted piety and honesty of the
promoter.

  “ It is very strange,” the inspector
continued. 11 For Sir Caleb Burnham
would seem the last man to wheel a
710

THE ALL-STORY MAGAZINE

truck about at night and take his life
to avoid being detected doing it. You
are quite sure that this is the man you
saw?”

  “ Quite sure,” I said.

  There was no possibility of doubt in
my mind, in spite of the man so exactly
like him whom I had left behind me in
Sartor Mansions.

CHAPTER III.

IN SARTOR MANSIONS.

  I was quite prepared to find that the
police took very little interest in the ac-
count of my meeting with the dead man's
“ double ” in Tedworth Street. A resem-
blance so exact has to be seen to be be-
lieved. When one is asked to believe in
it on hearsay it is more easy to dismiss
it as a mere hallucination.

  My mind had been full of the suicide
I had witnessed ; in a dark street 1 passed
a man of about the same height and size
as the victim. What was more natural
than that 1 should imagine a complete
resemblance?

  I knew quite well how my story would
be received, and 1 should not have
thought it worth while telling but for
the fact that the stranger had actually
stopped and tried the fateful door from
which I had seen Sir Caleb Burnham
start on his journey—to death.

  And the fact only seemed to make
the inspector at the floating station more
certain that I had been allowing my
imagination to run away with me. He
was a very decent fellow, a pleasing con-
trast to his confrere of Kings Road, but
despite Ins politeness, it was apparent to
me that my story made no effect upon
him at all.

  I did not blame him, but I was dis-
appointed in Constable Smith when I
left the station with him. I was imagin-
ing that with him, as with me, the recov-
ery of the body was a secondary affair.
The mystery of the packing-case seemed
to me our particular business.

  It was easy to see that the police dis-
missed it as a minor incident—a very
curious incident, no doubt, but one which
the evidence at the inquest, the ordinary
evidence of relatives and friends, would
serve to explain.

  My own view was that the suicide
would never be explained until the mys-
tery of the packing-case was solved, and
1 expected that Smith would agree with
me and be as eager as I was to follow
up our investigations from the end which
his superiors seemed determined to ig-
nore.

  But I was disappointed to find that
the ally on whom I had counted was
stolidly and completely satisfied. The
body was found, and his chief could no
longer deny that there had been a suicide
or pretend that he had done any more
than his duty in taking to the-station the
property the dead man had left behind
him.

  He was completely justified, and it
was all that he cared about. He was
only anxious to get back with his report,
and he was not interested in the man at
Sartor Mansions, even when I could
point out to him, in passing, that the
light in his window was still showing.

  Smith said that he did not see what
the man had to do with the case, and I
did not trouble to reiterate the point I
kept clear in my own mind, that he had
proved his connection with the mystery
conclusively by trying the door in the
garden of Erdenshaw House.

  I bade the constable a second good
night at the entrance to my own cham-
bers. and went indoors to root out of a
drawer a very serviceable revolver for
which I had found very little use after
I had settled down to the serious stav-at-
home work of the novelist. The revolver
was, however, still in good order, and I
charged its six chambers hastily. I did
not want the man in the next block to
turn the light out in his room before I
was ready to visit him, and I lost no
time in getting back to the street.

  But short as had been the time I spent
on preparation for the interview, I found
the light gone and the whole block
wrapped once more in darkness.

  I stood staring undecidedly. Having
made up my mind to risk the imperti-
nence and possible danger of calling on
a man whose name I did not know at
four o’clock ir the morning with no ex-
cuse beyond my gratuitous belief that
lie would be -'nterested to hear of Sir
Caleb Burnham’s death. I felt very loath
to put off the visit.
THE PACKING-CASE.

   But there are limits to the effrontery
of which I am capable even under the
spur of a maddening curiosity, and it
stopped at the idea of rousing the
stranger after he had retired. I had de-
cided very reluctantly that the interview,
on which I was counting for at least
some satisfaction of my curiosity, must
wait till the morning, when the door
opened and out came the very man I
wanted so much.

   I was relieved, and at the same time I
•was a little startled, and—well, I
clutched at the revolver in my pocket,
as I imagined again, from his attitude,
that the stranger was fingering his.

  He must have given a good deal more
observation to my movements than I had
fondly imagined, for he walked straight
to me.

  “ Who are you and what do you
want ? ” he asked, in a sharp tone of
nervously impatient demand.

  The man who was dead had addressed
me in very much the same tone, but the
voices were very different. The one to
which I listened now w:as, despite its
owner’s evident impatience, more gentle
and refined than the other, and helped to
encourage a theory which had been form-
ing itself in my mind.

  As a practised writer of detective
stories, I should have been ashamed of
myself if I had not evolved a theory
which made the police ridiculous. They
were puzzled to conjecture how a man
of Sir Caleb Burnham’s stamp could
take his life, and why he should have
abandoned his usual dignity so far as to
wheel a truck along the Embankment
before he did so.

  My idea was that Sir Caleb Burnham
would not think of doing either, that
the drowned man was impersonating him
for some reason, and that the real Sir
Caleb was the gentleman to whom I had
the honor of speaking. At any rate, the
theory gave me my best excuse for
forcing an interview’.

  "Sir Caleb Burnham, I believe?” I
said, very formally and politely.

  “ Well! and if I am Sir Caleb Burn-
ham ? ” he retorted, in the same tone of
nervous impatience, making me quite
confident that my theory was a true one.

  “ I thought it might interest you to
know that you are drowned,” 1 said.

  “ To be more explicit,” I continued,
as he stared at me, “ the body of a man
bearing a most remarkable resemblance
to you has just been fished out of the
river by the police and identified by them
without a moment’s hesitation as Sir
Caleb Burnham. So, unless you take
steps to prevent it, the news will be all
over London to-morrow that you have
committed suicide, Sir Caleb.”

  He regarded me with undisguised sus-
picion.

  “ I do not see your object in telling me
this,” he said* his tone full of distrust.

  “ I am surely justified in thinking that
it is of interest to you,” I replied easily,
and he interrupted me with nervous im-
patience.

  “ It is confoundedly interesting if it
is true. But who are you, and what is
your object? If I believe you, what do
you want me to do?”

  I had ceased to think about my re-
volver, although I imagined that my com-
panion was still keeping a ready finger
on his, and I handed him my card.

   !' My ulterior object is to satisfy a very-
active curiosity,” I said. “ My connec-
tion with the affair is only that of an
accidental observer. But what I have
seen to-night has mystified me to the
point of frenzy, and in exchange for my
news I am hoping that you will be able
to give me some, and that between us we
shall get some solution of about the most
bewildering series of events that has ever
come under my notice.”

  He was watching my face as I spoke,
too intent on trying to read from it
whether I was speaking the truth to
glance at the piece of cardboard I had
handed him. He remembered it abruptly,
and moved a step nearer the street-lamp
by which we were standing to read my
name. I could see the doubt and sus-
picion fade from his face.

  “ Not Mr. Selwyn Herbert the novel-
ist?” he asked, his voice and manner
suddenly aifiiable.

  I should have been more pleased if he
had said the playwright, but it was, of
course, early days for that, and I was
very glad that my tales, at least, were
sufficiently well known to him to serve as
an introduction.

  My companion said some very pleasant
things about my latest detective stories.
712

THE ALL-STORY MAGAZINE

  “ If anybody can solve a mystery—and
this one lias been bewildering me for a
month—I should think you can. Mr.
Herbert," he said warmly. “ If you
really do not mind giving tne the time,
I should be awfully glad to nave your
ideas on it. especially as you seem to have
seen something that probably has a bear-
ing on it."

  I smiled to myself at his idea that the
writing of detective stories, in which one
really begins with the solution and works
back’ to the mystery, is any proof of
actual detective ability, but I did not
wish to lessen his pleasing faith in me,
and in this case I felt pretty confident
that his “ mystery ". would serve as the
key to mine. I had a hundred questions
to ask him.

  “ I shall be only too pleased." I said.
“To begin with, were you aware that
you had a ‘double’? If you were, and
know his name, we have, 1 think, estab-
lished the identity of the man who
drowned himself to-night."

  He looked at me as if my question had
for the moment bewildered him. and
smiled faintly.

  “ If the police have identified him as
Sir Caleb Burnham, and he is as much
like me as you say, then I suppose it i«
—Sir Caleb Burnham." he said slowly.
“ And for some reasons I am not sorry
to hear that he is dead.”

  I stared at him.

  “Sir Caleb Burnham? Then who are
you ? ”

  “ Oh ! My name is Carton—Dudley
Carton. Rut there is no need for us to
stand talking in the street. Come up to
my rooms.”

  He turned toward the door of the dark
block before which we had been stand-
ing as he spoke. But I hesitated.

  I am not a coward. But at the same
time. I am not foolhardy. And it seemed
to me that there would lie something a
little foolhardy in accepting the invita-
tion from a man of whom I knew nothing
except that he had been accused of a par-
ticularly ferocious and apparently mo-
tiveless murder and owed his acquittal to
a happy chance.

  Glancing back quickly, be saw my
hesitation and shrugged his broad shoul-
ders.

  “ We'll talk in the street, if you prefer

it." he said. “ You recognize my name.
I suppose? It is not the name 1 am
living under now, but as I was going
to tell you the whole storv, it seemed
silly to start with a deception. I forgot
that it would have the same effect ou
you as on other people.

  " Hut I think you might at least hear
my account of the affair before fighting
shy of me, like everybody else, just be-
cause of an old fisherman's mistake that
he did not even stick to. I know it is
asking a lot of you, but you might at
least hear my side.”

  His humility was touching, and I had
sufficient sense of justice to remember
that the charge against him had been dis-
missed. If he had shown the least eager-
ness to persuade me to enter the house
I should have refused, but as it was—
well. I remembered, among other things,
that I had a revolver.

  “ Of course, I will hear it, if it is part
of your ‘ mystery,’ " I said. “ and it will
be more comfortable to hear it indoors,
thanks, if you will lead the way.”

  I	followed him. not without the little
thrill which adds to the pleasure of do-
ing something a trifle daring, to the room
on the first floor at which I had looked
more than once with so much interest
from the Embankment.

  The interior, although comfortable
enough, was too plainly suggestive of the
'■ furnished apartment" to make me
waste attention by looking around it for
indications of my host’s character or
tastes.

  My host solicitously pulled forward
an armchair for me. then sat down on
the other side of a center-table.

  “ This is awfully good of you," he
said, pushing a cigar-hox toward me.
“ And I feel it all the more because I
am really a complete stranger in the
country. I left England as a young-
>ter. and never saw it again till a couple
of month' ago. And 1 must say that I
have had a pretty rough time here, so
far.

  “ They told me at Melbourne that I'
should find the old country slow, but.
so far. I've found it pretty exciting. It
does not fall to the lot of every visitor
to your country to be accused of murder
within a month of his landing. I sup-
pose?"
  I	was searching my memory for the
details of the affair.

  “ So far as 1 remember the newspaper
report,” 1 said, “ you were accused of
clubbing a man on the front parade at
Broadstairs and throwing the body over
the cliff. You were recognized as the as-
sailant by somebody—a fisherman, wasn't
it?—who witnessed the affair, but his
evidence was upset by your lawyer, with
the assistance of a lucky chance. I took
a note of the affair at the time, as one of
the few things one sees in the papers
dramatic enough to do service in a plav.”

  Carton threw out his hands in a ges-
ture of expostulation.

  '• That is how everybody puts it, and
it is not fair. They talk as though I got
off by a lucky chance. The chance—
and a damnably unlucky one—was that I
was suspected at all. But let me tell
you just what happened.”

  He spoke with strong feeling, and half
rose from the chair; but my attitude
reminded him. I suppose, that I was a
little suspicious of him still, and he sank
back, his arms hanging ostentatiously
limp over the sides of his chair, his voice
dropping again to the conversational
note.

  “ I went to Broadstairs,” he said,
“ just to see the house where Charles
Dickens worked. I’d been to Gad's Hill
and Yarmouth, and had visited practi-
cally every spot in Yor>don that he men-
tions in his books or that he has been
connected with. I worship Charles
Dickens.”

  II	So do 1,” fr said, and decided that I
liked the man.

  “ It was really the chief thing 1
wanted to come home for. I left Eng-
land, as 1 told you, when I was ten, and
1 have no personal interests here. But
I always said that when 1 could afford
it-"

  I nodded impatiently.

  “ And the Dickens Pilgrimage took
you naturally to Broadstairs, where the
story begins ? ”

  “ Yes. I put up at the Albion Hotel.
\n here I found myself the only visitor;
had dinner, and walked out on the front.
It was quite deserted, it being out of
the season, you know, and as it was al-
ready dark. I went for a stiff walk, leav-
ing Bleak House for the morning.

  “ When 1 got back, the place had
changed. There was quite a crowd on
the front, and they told me that a man
had been murdered and thrown over the
cliff. A fisherman had seen it all, and
had run up in time to seize the murderer,
but the man had proved too powerful
for him. After a short struggle, he had
knocked his would-be captor down and
made good his escape.

  “ The fisherman had been too much
dazed by his knock-down blow to know
in what direction he had gone, and had
hurried into the town with the news of
what had happened. The crowd was
watching some half-dozen boats pad-
dling about near the foot of the cliff,
looking for the victim’s body, and 1
waited there, watching with them, until
a wiry little man in a blue fisherman’?;
jersey, who had just come on the scene
with a policeman, made a sudden rush
at me, yelling like a maniac:

  “ ‘That’s him—that's him! Seize
him! Don’t let him get away!’

  “ He had me by the throat, and the
policeman grabbed my arm and pre-
vented my knocking him off to answer
for myself, and I believe every man in
the crowd, and some of the women, got
a grip of me somewhere or other.

  “ The policeman persuaded them not
to throw me over the cliff. I believe:
but by the time I had been dragged up
to the station my coat was hanging in
rags around me, and my collar and tie
had gone altogether. And that, on my
solemn word of honor, Mr. Herbert, is
the only part I played in the Broadstairs
Murder, as they call it."

  He waited as if for an expression of
opinion, but I gave none, and he .con-
tinued :

  “ I was locked up in a cell for the
night, and the next morning was brought
up before the magistrates. I had man-
aged to see a lawyer, but he seemed to
think that I was sure to be committed, as
the fisherman was so certain of his recog-
nition. There was. of course, no other
evidence against me except that I was
a stranger, and therefore a natural ob-
ject of suspicion.

  “ To make matters worse, the body of
the murdered man had been found, and
from papers in his pockets it appeared
that he, too. had quite recently come

from Australia. Tbt fact increased the
suspicion against me, but the charge ac-
tually rested entirely on the fisherman >
certainty that he recognized me. Unless
that was shaken, my lawyer gave me to
understand that he could not save me
from being sent to trial.

  “ At the Examination, therefore, he
directed all his efforts to making the wit-
ness show some uncertainty. 1 he fisher-
man was not to be moved. It was dark,
but there was light er.oagh for him to
see the murderer plainly when he grap-
pled with him. He could ni'i say what
the material of his clothes was. but he
was sure of his height and build.

  “ • And suppose you were told that at
the time you were struggling with the
murderer this gentleman was quietly
dining a! the Albion Hotel.’ asked my
lawyer, who was preparing a feeble at-
tempt at an alibi. ‘ what should you
say?’	—

  “ ‘ I should say it was a lie,’ said the
witness, and won a murmur of approval
from the crowded room.

  “ The lawyer who was so vainly try-
ing to clear me looked round as if to
deprecate it, and seemed for a moment to
have forgotten his cross-examination.

  “ He was staring across the room at
the crowd by the door, and I saw his face
brighten suddenly.

  “ ‘ Sir Caleb Burnham,’ he said, rais-
ing his voice to speak across the room,
' would you mind stepping forward a
moment? Sir Caleb, don’t go. please.
I won’t keep you a minute, if you will
spare me it.’

  " There was a stir in the room, and
Sir Caleb came up to the solicitor’s table,
with evident annoyance in his manner,
it was the first time I had seen him. and
even I noticed the resemblance he bore
to me at once, although 1 suppose that
one does not realize it so quickly as other
people.

  “ The lawyer asked him to stand by
the side of the pew where they had caged
me. and turned to the fisherman again.
But the witness did not wait for a ques-
tion : ‘ Why. that’s the man! ’ he shouted
excitedly. * I thought the other one had
a bit too much color and too much brown
on his face, but the white-faced one is
him.’

  “ Everybody laughed, even the magis-

trates. The old man’s sudden change of
opinion after the certainty with which
he had been swearing that he recognized
me was very funny, and to make the joke
complete, it seemed that everybody in the
court knew Sir Caleb Burnham by name
as an uncommonly good and pious sort of
big-bug.

  •’ My lawyer got another laugh by ask-
ing him whether he had committed the
murder, and he replied, without going
into the witness-box or being sworn, that
he had only come down by the midnight
train, and had not even heard of the
murder till he looked in at the court
through idle curiosity.”

  When my host had reached this point
in his narrative I interrupted him.

  “ I read the case in the papers.’’ I said.
" but, so far as I remember, they did not
mention Sir Caleb Burnham's name.”
Carton shook his head.

  “ No, as far as I can make out, it never
appeared in print. He seemed to me
throughout very much annoyed by the
position in which the lawyer’s recognition
had placed him. and I imagine that he
paid to keep his name out of it as far as
possible. There were. I believe, only a
few local reporters present, and I sup-
pose they could be bribed to speak of
him as ‘a well-known public man’ in-
stead of giving his name. But what does
that prove?”

  “ Nothing, unless Sir Caleb actually
murdered the man at Broadstairs and
could not restrain his eagerness to know
what evidence was given at your exam-
ination. What do you think? "

  Carton threw out his hands in a gesture
of exasperated impotence.

  “ Oh. I am sick of thinking. I f he
did commit the murder, it does not seem
to explain in any way the strange things
that happened afterward—the mystery
that baffles me. and that 1 am hoping you
will help me to solve. Mr. Herbert."

  "I wi'u. do my best,” I said; “but
please go on.”

  “ I will go straight on. if you don’t
mind.” he said, “ just as things hap-
pened. though I can’t decide, of course,

what would seem important to you and
what wouldn't.

  “ As you know, the charge against me
was dismissed. My lawyer urged that
there was now no evidence against me.
The only evidence had been that of the
fisherman, and he admitted emphatically
that I was not the man he had struggled
with. The murderer probably bore some
slight resemblance to me, as also to the
deeply respected gentleman who seemed
almost to have been sent by a watchful
Providence to clear me from a baseless
suspicion. It would be as preposterous
to send me for trial on the mere strength
of that resemblance as it would be to
send Sir Caleb himself.

  “ After a little discussion among them-
selves, the magistrates agreed that there
was no case against me, and I was dis-
charged. 1 have often wished since that
I had been sent to trial and had the case
absolutely thrashed out, but I took it for
granted that the dismissal of the charge
meant that I was cleared from suspicion.

  “ The whole business had seemed to
me ridiculous, and instead of feeling
thankful for my escape, as the lawyer
seemed to expect, I was only thinking of
the annoyance I had been put to.

  “ I soon found out that the annoyance
had only begun. I went with my lawyer
to his office, and waited there until he
could get me a cab to take me back to
my hotel at Broadstairs. The news of
my acquittal had preceded me, and as
I was running up to my room, feeling
very anxious to get into a respectable
dress again, the manager met me, bar-
ring my way.

  “ My luggage had been deposited at
the police station, and he handed me my
bill for the dinner I had had there. It
was all the charge they wished to make,
and I gathered from the manager’s man-
ner that even that charge would not be
pressed if I would relieve the hotel of
my presence instantly. I paid my bill,
drove back to the police station for my
luggage, and tried another hotel. But it
was just the same. Very politely, but
very firmly, they regretted that they
could not give me a room.

  “ By this time there was a crowd fol-
lowing my cab and hooting me. Finally,
I had to change my clothes at the police
station and ask for an escort to see me

to the next train leaving the town. I
took ticket to London, and left the whole
population of Broadstairs congratulating
itself, I believe, that a dangerous mur-
derer had been driven from its midst.

  •' I still imagined that the feeling
against me was purely local, and 011
reaching town 1 went back to the apart-
ments 1 had occupied while I was follow-
ing Charles Dickens about Fleet Street
and the Temple. The landlady seemed
glad to see me back, till the evening
papers came out.

  " Thanks to a scarcity of news or the
touch of drama by which my acquittal
had been secured, the journals had made
a sensation of it, and when my landlady
came to me with a scared face and pre-
tended that she had made a mistake and
that my rooms had really been let to
somebody else who wanted to come into
them at once, I realized for the first time
that the thing was serious. After the
publicity given to my name. I foresaw
that the treatment I had received at
Broadstairs was likely to be the treat-
ment I should receive everywhere. You
know yourself, Mr. Herbert, what effect
it had on you. Even now you think that
you are doing a rather daring thing in
sitting here alone with me.”

  He spoke very-seriously, and went on
without giving me an opportunity to
reply.

  “ And I have no doubt the news will
go over to Melbourne and be made much
of there. It will ruin the hopes I had
of a political career when I go back, un-
less that unfortunate tragedy at Broad-
stairs is explained, and, so far. there
seems 110 chance of its being cleared up.

  “ The man, Murgatroyd, who was
killed had only been two days in Eng-
land, and apparently had 110 connections
here. They can’t even discover why he
went to Broadstairs or what he was do-
ing there. But of course you have read
all that the papers have hail to say about
him, and know as much about him as I
do. I have set a private detective 011
the business, and I have stayed in Lon-
don to keep in touch with him, but he
has found out no more than the police,
and charges me pretty heavily for that.

  “ I suggested to him yesterday, as you
suggested to-night, that Sir Caleb Burn-
ham might have actually been the mur-
716

                                              *

derer, but he laughed at the idea. I
don’t believe in these private detectives,
and that is why I am so awfully glad to
put the facts before an acknowl-
edged-”

  And he said more pleasant things
about my detective stories, which tended
only to show that he confused the writer
of them with the hero.

  1 moved my hand farther from my re-
volver-pocket as I deprecated his com
pinnents.

  “ Have you had any reason to connect
Burnham with the murder apart from
the fisherman's imagined recognition?”
I asked.

  Carton shook his head.

  “ With the murder? No, none at all.
It is his connection with me that I can’t
understand, and whether he killed the
man at BroadstairT’or not does not seem
to me to make any explanation of it pos-
sible. But I will continue with an ac-
count ol' things as they happened, if I
am not trying your patience.”

  I assured him that he was not.

  “ Well, I did not remonstrate with
my landlady,” he said, taking up the
thread of his narrative. “ I just cleared
out to an hotel. But I put up there as
1 William Dudley,’ and I have not
thought of using my own name since ex-
cept to my fool of a detective and to
you. The point is important to remem-
ber.

  “ It was at the hotel, a little place
near the Strand, that I realized first
that I was being shadowed. On reach-
ing the London terminus from Broad-
stairs I had casually noticed a ferrety-
looking little man with flaming red hair
waiting on the platform, who seemed to
glance at me with interest, and I thought
it only a coincidence when I recognized
him strolling past the house when I
quitted my apartments. But when the
next m< rning I caught sight of him out-
side my hotel 1 had no doubt that he was
keeping watch nn me, and I concluded
wrongly that the police authorities
wished to keep an eye on me pending any
fresh development in the Broadstairs
affair.

  “ I was not afraid of the police, but
I objected to being watched, especially
when I had decided to change my name
and conceal my connection with the

Dudley Carton of the newspaper sensa-
tion. So when I again moved into
chambers here I went to no end of
trouble to make sure that I was not fol-
lowed. And I thought I had suc-
ceeded.” *

  Carton passed a fresh cigar and
struck a match for me.

  “ Well, the next thing,” he continued,
“ and this is where the mystery that
baffles me really begins, 1 received an
anonymous letter addressed to me here
in my real name. It said that the writer
had information of great personal im-
portance to give me if I could arrange to
meet her, alone, on the Victoria Bridge,
between ten and eleven the same night.

  “ 1 found the letter in the rack in the
hall, and thanked Providence that it had
not been refused at the house, since no
Dudley Carton was known there, and I
took possession of it surreptitiously,
when nobody was in the hall.

  “ After consideration I decided to
keep the appointment, if only through
curiosity to know how anybody had
found out where I was living, for it
seemed to me that nobody could have
any news of importance to me, unless,
perhaps, it ha's to do with the crime that
had thrown a shadow over my life.

  “ So I put a revolver in my pocket, in
case it might be some common robbing
fraud, and was on the bridge at ten. I
waited there for over the hour without
the slightest sign of a woman, and was
just deciding that the letter was a hoax
of some sort, when a man, passing, stared
at me, stopped, and held out his hand.

     Mr. Carton, isn't it?’ he said, be-
fore I recognized him. ‘ I have often
wondered whether we should meet again,
and hoped that we might. Are you liv-
ing in this part of London?’

  “ It was Sir Caleb Burnham, and his
friendly recognition pleased me all the
more because 1 had been feeling like a
pariah. He ran on talking without wait-
ing for me to answer, telling me that he
lived just over the bridge, at Battersea,
had been delayed late at a board meet-
ing in the City, and had failed to find
a cab at Sloane Street to drive him home.

  “ He called it another intervention of
Providence, since it had led to our meet-
ing. The striking resemblance between
us had interested him very much, he

said, and he had been anxious to make
my acquaintance and find out whether
there was not some relationship between
us. A brother of his father’s had emi-
grated to Australia some fifty years ago
and been lost sight of. In any case, if
there was any truth in the claims of the
physiognomists we ought to find that we
had a great many tastes in common. And
he ended by asking whether I would
walk home with him.

  “ I should not have hesitated for a mo-
ment. but for my fear of missing the
writer of the anonymous letter and losing
the chance on which I had counted of
learning facts that might be of impor-
tance to me, and I explained the posi-
tion to my new friend, showing him the
letter. Sir Caleb read it through in the
light of one of the bridge lamps, and
quietly proceeded to tear the paper into
small pieces.

  “1 That is the only way to treat
anonymous letters,' he said, as he let the
scraps flutter over the bridge into _Jhe
river. ‘ I receive hundreds of them, and
treat them all alike. People who won’t
sign their names are always rogues and
are trying to serve themselves, not to
serve you. And it is a quarter past
eleven now.’ he added, glancing at his
watch. ‘ Vou do not intend to wait here
all night. I dare say it was merely the
trick of some thief who picked 011 your
name by chance, and when he got you
here decided that you were a bit too
sturdy-looking' to attack.'

  “ I could have told Sir Caleb.” Car-
ton continued, giving me another of his
diffident inquiring glances, as if to ask
whether my patience was being ex-
hausted by all these details—“ I could
have told Sir Caleb that his easy explana-
tion of the letter was wrong, because no
ordinary thief could be aware that Dud-
ley Carton was living at my address, but
I did not care to discuss it. I was feel-
ing ashamed of the hopes I had -allowed
myself to build on the meeting, and since
my anonymous correspondent had now
plainly failed to keep the appointment,
1 allowed myself to be persuaded, and
went on with my new friend.

  “He had put hiss arm jn mine, and
chatted with the utmost amiability as we
walked the little way to his house, an
important-looking place facing on Bat-

tersea Park. Burnham opened the door
with his latch-key and switched 011 the
light in the hall, lie did not believe in’
making slaves of his servants, he told
me, and his household always retired ai
eleven, whether he was home or not.
There was a comfortable fire, which
seemed to have been very recently at-
tended to, however, burning in his study,
and a carefully shaded oil-lamp was
alight.

  “ The baronet made a most genial host,
lie could not have laid himself out more
to be agreeable if I had come to him with
the best credentials on earth instead of
owing my introduction to my arrest for
murder, and I said something of the sort.

  “ ‘ I am sufficiently vain,- he replied,
to think that no credentials could be
better than your face. I feel as though
1 have found a twin brother, and I want
to see as much of you as ever I can.’

  “ I do not think I felt any actual dis-
trust of him, although the very excess of
his friendliness gave to the whole meet-
ing a sort of unreality that forbade me
to take his protestations quite seriously.
He was pressing me to visit him at his
country-place in Kent and spend a week
or two with him there, and when I said,
with ordinary politeness, that I should be
very much pleased he proceeded at once
to make the invitation and my accept-
ance of it definite.

  “ He was going down in the morning,
by the first train, for a few weeks' holi-
day. Why should not 1 accompany him?
I pleaded that I could think of nothing at
present but the clearing of my name, and
that it was necessary lor me to keep in
touch with Clash, the private detective.
But Sir Caleb brushed the objections
away. My name did not need clearing,
nobody but a fool could attach any sus-
picion to me, and in a month the whole
affair would be forgotten. Clash was
quite incompetent—an idea I was arriv-
ing at myself—and if I was really set 011
investigating he would introduce me to
the best man in England for the job.

  “ Trickett was the man for me—a veri-
table Sherlock Holmes—and he would
get him down to Sarbury, his country-
place, while I was there, to talk it over
with me. I had no actual objections left
to offer against my host’s plan, and I
was too much bewildered by his effusive-

ness lo resist him. After feeling myself
such an outcast it was very pleasant to
find my company so much desired, and
by a man so rich and influential.

  “ He began to make arrangements for
our meeting early in the morning, and
made me glance at my watch. It was
nearly midnight.

  “ i That gives me only six hours,' 1
said, and rose reluctantly. The room
was very cozy, and 1 was unconsciously
sleepy. My host pushed me down again.

  “‘Why turn out at all,’ he said. ‘I
can easily give you a bed here. Do
they go to bed early at your place?’

  “ As a matter of fact, they do not.
The head porter never shuts the outside
door till half past twelve at the earliest,
and 1 have wondered since whether
Burnham was acquainted with the fact.

   " ‘ That’s all right, then,' he said, when
I told him. ‘Just write the man a line
and tell him y.ou won't be back to-night;
ask him to bundle all your things
into your boxes and give them to the
bearer. If you take your rooms by the
week, you might as well settle up with
the people. It is of no use paying for
empty rooms while you are away. Write
the letter, and I will send my secretary
across with it to bring your traps back.
Then we shall not stand any chance of
missing each other in the morning.'

  “ He got oul a sheet of note-paper for
me as he spoke, and pushing a pen into
my hand, actually dictated what I should
say. Before I had really thought of de-.
ciding whether I wished to give up my
rooms or not, 1 had informed the head
porter that I was staying the night with
a friend and going into the country for
an indefinite time on the morrow, and
requested him to make out m.y bill to
the end of the week.

  “ I had no money with me to meet it. I
had thought it prudent to leave my purse
in my one portmanteau, which, as it hap-
pened. I kept packed and ready, in case
I found it necessary to change my quar-
ters at a moment's notice. But my host
made light of lending me the money
which would enable his secretary to set-
tle up everything for me.

  “‘ But is .not your secretary in bed?’
I asked him, and he shook his head.

  “‘No; Diplock always sits up, in
case I bring work home with me. As

a matter of fact, I have some for him
to do when he returns,'

   “ He took the letter and left the room,
closing the door behind him. I stirred
the fire, lighted another cigar, and
leaned back in drowsiness, feeling a ra-
ther comfortable sense of satisfaction
at being taken so entirely under an
influential man's wing. But I had been
so hurried along without a moment for
thought that not till 1 was alone did
I remember a somewhat important mis-
take I had made in my letter.

  “ As it happened, 1 had not had an
occasion for telling Sir Caleb about my
change of name, and I wrote the letter
so completely under his influence that
when he had said: 1 Now your signature.
Carton,’ 1 had written my actual name.
If the mistake was not remedied, the
.poor secretary would only reach Sartor
Mansions to find that the head-porter
did not know who D. Carton was.

   “ I opened the door quickly, to recall
the letter.

  " In the hall below I could hear the
murmur of voices. Sir Caleb was evi-
dently giving his secretary his direc-
tions and 1 hastened to join them. But
before I was half way down the flight,
I heard the hall-door close, and at the
same moment the light below me was
switched off, leaving me in darkness.
Impelled by the thought that the secre-
tary was leaving the house. I hurried
on in the darkness, and groped my way
to the door to open it. At the same
moment Sir Caleb, whom I had passed
in the complete darkness, switched on
the light again to see what was hap-
pening.

  “ 1 What on earth is the matter?’ he
asked, but 1 was already outside the
house calling to the man who had just
left it. He turned at once, and as I
caught sight of him, I turned suddenly
sick with apprehension.

  " Sir Caleb Burnham's secretary was
the ferrety little man with flaming red
hair whom I had seen ‘ shadowing' me
when I first reached town.

  “ I have wondered since,” Carton con-
tinued, after waiting to see whether I
was properly impressed by the sensa-
tionalism of the fact he had just given
me. “ I have wondered since why I took
alarm so instantly, and felt all at once
THE PACKING-CASE.

that the house was a trap which 1 could
not enter again at any price.

  “ Of course when you comc to reason
it out calmly, 1 was justified, I think, in
feeling uneasy. If it was Burnham who
had been having me shadowed, he must
have had some greater object than the
mere interest he pretended to take in me
on account of our likeness, and after
having taken the trouble to have ma
shadowed it was not likely that he would
owe his meeting with me to chance. It
was more probable that he had written
me the anonymous letter with the sole
purpose of getting me to his house with-
out even his servants knowing that we
had met.

  “ It looks suspicious all round when
one considers it. But what surprises
me now is that I should have jumped
to all these deductions straight off with-
out reasoning for a moment, and be in
a terror to get clear of the place. Burn-
ham had followed me out quickly and
already had his arm in mine. The secre-
tary stood between us and the street,
staring, and really wondering, I believe,
which of us was his employer, and I
conquered the inclination to pull out my
revolver and fight for my freedom. The
shock had steadied me and made me
quite cool and resourceful.

  “‘What on earth is the matter?’
Burnham was asking me again.

  111	Only that I was sending your secre-
tary on a fool's errand,' 1 said, and ex-
plained about my name.

  “ Burnham seemed relieved.

  “ ‘ Well! you can soon write the letter
again,’ he said, and I reentered the hall
with him. But as I reached the rack
where my hat and overcoat were hang-
ing. I stopped.

  “ ‘ I think after all I had better go
mvself,’ I said. ‘ There are two or three
things lying about that they might forget
to pack, and I am sure to get a cab on
the Embankment. It will save me
troubling about breakfast and being
wakened in the morning, if you don't
mind my coming back to you to sleep.”

  “ I believe I spoke quite easily, and
left my friend satisfied that 1 should
come back to him. But I did not go
back.

  “ I wrote him a polite note instead,
regretting that I had found a telegram

awaiting me which prevented my ac-
cepting his kind invitation. You see I
was quite uncertain whether 1 had
escaped a deep laid plot, or was making
a fool of myself by distrusting the only
man who had offered me any hospitality
since 1 landed in England. I am not
sure yet, and that is the great problem
I want you to solve for me, Mr. Her-
bert.”

  Dudley Carton leaned back in his
chair and waited as if I were an oracle
for my answer.

  “ I should say,” I answered, trying
hard to be oracular, “ especially after
what I have seen to-night, that you did
well to give Sir Caleb a wide berth. His
evident effort to prepare the people here
for your disappearance, and prevent
them making inquiries about you if you
never returned, looks very sinister. If
you had spent the night in the house at
Battersea there seems a fair possibility
that it would have been your last.”

  “ That is what I think,” he said, quite
pleased by my indorsement of his suspi-
cion. “ But why? Even given that he
killed the man at Broadstairs, what
could he possibly hope to do or gain by
my death? That is what baffles me.”

  It baffled me too, but I did not care
to say so.

  “ Please go on with your story,” 1
said instead. “ I should like to hear
more—especially what happened to you
to-night to take you to Tedworth Street,
and make you try one of the garden
doors there.”

CHAPTER V.

THE CHRISTIAN COM PAN Y-PROMOTLU.

  “ The next day,” said Dudley Carton,
continuing his story. “ I had a visit from
Diplock, the secretary. He said that Sir
Caleb had been disappointed when I did
not return, but had congratulated him-
self afterward when he found that he
too was unable to get away from town.
He was hoping that I would let him
know when I was free, and that we could
still manage to get away together.

  “ I could see that he was very anxious
to know whether my excuse was a pre-
tended one, and I did not take any great
pains to make it appear genuine,
especially when he went on to say that
720

THE ALL-STORY MAGAZINE.

Sir Caleb was likely to be busy in the
City late for,. the nest few days, but
would be glad if I could call in for a
chat again when he was at home after
eleven at night.

   “ I answered politely and indefinitely.
I was very determined not to go near the
house overlooking Battersea Park again,
and I did not care whether Diplock and
his master guessed the fact or not. But
I was still quite uncertain whether I
was making a fool of myself by feeling
any queer sensation> about my visit, and
I did not want to lose Sir Caleb’s friend-
ship if it was a bona tide one. I was
quite ready to meet any advances that
he cared to make in an ordinary open
manner. Bat I may say that he has
made none.

   " In the fortnight that has passed since
our meeting on the Victoria bridge, he
has never called on me. or written to me;
he has never invited me to his house,
except for an hour when the household
would be asleep. He has never asked
me to meet him in the City. And all
the time I have had that man Diplock
meeting me near here, as if by accident,
and telling me how anxious Sir Caleb
was to see me, and twice I have met
Burnham himself in the same way at
night, and he has tried hard to get me
to go home with him.

  “ Now what do you make of it, Mr.
Herbert? I confess that I can't think
what it means, and it has got on my
nerves. I have thought, of course, of
leaving these apartments and changing
my name again, but my curiosity won’t
let me. I want to avoid danger, but I
want more to know whether there is any
danger to avoid.

  “ That is why I said that for some
things I s. ould be glad to hear that
Burnham is dead. If he h*as really com-
mitted suiYide. I suppose my danger is
at an end. hut I should almost feel sorry,
if it means that I am never to under-
stand what he really wanted with me, es-
pecially if it interferes with my chance
of ever clearing up the Broadstairs
affair. T do not know whether you agree
with me. but I feel as though that is
finally at the bottom of it all. What do
you think, Mr. Herbert?”

  I did not offer an opinion. Although

I	would not have admitted it for worlds

to the man who was appealing to me
with such pathetic dependenre. I was
simply bewildered by the strange story
he had told me.

  “ You have not obtained any due to
the Broadstairs murder, which it would
be worth the actual murderer's while to
suppress ?’’ 1 asked.

  He shook his head.

  “ Not a scrap of a clue. I have not
made any inquiries at all because 1 know
it is not in my line. I have not any Of
your wonderful deductive powers, Mr.
Herbert, and I have left it entirely in
my detective’s hands. If he has found
out anything—and he seems a complete
fool at the business—i: would be Clash
and not me that the murderer would
want to silence. Now can you see why
Burnham-”

  I	most decidedly could not see and I
interrupted him.

  “But about to-night?” I said, hoping
that the affair would show some, light
when we got to the mystery of the pack-
ing-case, and were able to supplement
Dudley Carton's story with mine.

  II	Oh! to-night,” he said. “ I had
another letter from my anonymous
friend by the last post, addressed to me
this time in my assumed name, to make
sure that I should receive it, I suppose.
She began by apologizing for her failure
to meet me on the bridge, and explained
that she was in hiding from the police,
and that they had made it impossible
for her to leave her hiding-place or com-
municate with me till now. -

  “ And she said outright that she knew
I wanted to solve the mystery of the
Broadstairs murder, and that she could
give me the whole account of the affair
for a five-pound note, if I would meet
her with the money at a spot where she'
would be safe from the watchful eyes
of the police, a spot temptingly close
to me."

  “In Tedworth Street?'' I inquired,
and he stared at me.

  “ How do you know?”

  “ I met you first there," I said, “ pay-
ing ' particular attention to a certain
house on the north side.”

  “ The thirteenth." said Carton. “ I
was to go there at twelve o'clock precise-
ly. knock twice at the garden door, and
open it. My informant would be wait-

                          /

ing to discuss the Broadstairs affair. It
was tempting, yojj know, fishy a? it all
sounded. I was strongly inclined to
keep the appointment, as I had kept the
appointment on the bridge. I have not
the least certainty, you know, that Burn-
ham had really anything to do with the
first letter.”

  “ He had with the second," I said
with certainty. “ But please go on. You
did not keep the appointment?”

   Carton reddened slightly as he shook
his head.

   “No, I got in a complete fright as the
time drew near, and I dared not venture
outside the house. I ought of course to
have kept watch on the place, but—well
—I turned coward, and I dared not go
out for a couple of hours even to look
at the place. It was then that I met
you, and when I saw you follow me
home I got a' fit of the nerves again. It
was not till I saw you pass again with a
policeman in uniform that my curiosity
got the upper hand and I made up my
mind to see*if you had anything to tell
me. And here we are as a consequence.
Now, what have you to tell me? ”

  " Only that if you had kept the ap-
pointment you would probably have been
struck down and killed as you entered
the garden,” I said, 11 that your dead
body would have been put in a packing-
case and wheeled by Sir Caleb Burnham
across the bridge to bis house at Batter-
sea, I suppose.

   “ As you did not turn up, his confed-
erate filled' the bos with bricks to give it
the weight, required, put a little blood
on it to persuade Sir Caleb that the crime
was committed. Contrary to his expecta-
tion Sir Caleli was stopped on the way
and, nnagming.thai your dead body was
in the case, jumped into the river to
avoid arrest and was drowned."

  And I told him my story to prove my
hypothesis.

  Dudley Carton heard me through in
silence, and nodded his head when 1 had
finished.

  “ That is clear enough. I have felt
all along, of course, that Burnham never
meant me to leave his liouse alive the
night he got me there, and that is why
he wanted my affairs to be settled up
here so that the people of the house
W"uld not think of making inquiry about

     10	S

me when I disappeared. He found that
he could not get me to the house alive
without anybody knowing 1 had gone
there, so he sqhemed to take me there
dead.

  “ But why, Mr. Herbert? That is
what I want you to tell me. What on
earth was it for? That i§ what I want
you to tell me, as I suppose you can

when you have such wonderful-”

And he said kind and wholly mistaken
things about my detective ability again.

  They irritated me a little. Carton
was regarding me with his pathetic air
of perfect confidence, as if he had man-
aged at last to get the penny in the slot
and had only to open the drawer of my
mind and take out the complete solution
of all that had puzzled him.

  And the solution was not there. I
knew only what he knew, that there had
been a very deliberate and cunning at-
tempt on his life, but the reason for it,
which he confidently expected me to
tell him. simply because I have written
a few ingenious detective stories, was as
far from my understanding as his.

  But I hated to say so, and I rose from
my chair to pace the floor, as T always
do when I have a knotty point in a
story to work out. I had long ceased to
think of the revolver in my pocket, and
I gave “ the Broadstairs Murderer,” as I
had called him in my mind when we
entered the house, full opportunity to
take me unawares if he wished.

  But he only watched me with an al-
most reverential expectancy for the re-
sult of my thinking. I had stopped at
the uncurtained window unconsciously,
and from the Embankment below me
came the sound of a rapidly driven cab
which stopped at the house.

  “ Here’s somebody stopping,” I said.
“ Perhaps they have brought us the ex-
planation.”

  Looking back at the affair afterward, it
seems to me that it was the only thing I
contributed in the whole affair to justify
Dudky Carton’s faith in me.

  He had given his mind up to my
leadership sufficiently to take- the words
quite seriously, and he hurried down to
open the hall-door, while I followed for
want of anything better to do. wonder-
ing how I shoufd maintain my reputa-
tion when he discovered that it was only

one of the inmate# of the house return-
ing from a night out.

  As a matter of fact 'it was a messen-
ger from Charing Cross Hospital who
wanted “ Mr. William Dudley" or “ Mr.
Dudley Carton," whichever he cared to
call himself, to accompany him post
haste to satisfy the urgent wish of a
dying man—a man called Diplock.

  Diplock had made an attempt, the
messenger explained, to board the tidal
express for Dover and the Continent as
it was leaving Charing Cross Station.
He had made a frantic rush for the
moving train, and, impeded by a heavy
bag in his hand, had fallen and been
drawn under the guard's van. He was
terribly injured and there was no hope
of his recovery, but now, after lying for
four hours insensible in the hospital, he
had awakened to full consciousness, and
begged urgently that Mr. Carton might
be sent for.

  One would scarcely believe it, but
Carton seemed uncertain whether to go
to him. He had been driven into such
a nervous state by the mysterious efforts
of this man Diplock and his employer
to get him into their power, that I be-
lieve he was still doubtful whether this
was not only a trap set for him. He
looked at me quite appealingly.

  “ You will come with me, won't vou.
Mr. Herbert?"

  “ What do you think ?" I retorted.
“ Hurry up. He may be dead before
we hear what he has to say."

  I	pushed him impatiently forward and
in another moment we were all three
crowded into the hansom, and the driver
was urging his horse to its full speed
again. We were too tightly packed—
for Carton is a big man—for anything
like easy conversation, but the messen-
ger told us in answer to a query of mine
that Diplock knew his hack was broken
—it was his most serious injury—and
that there was no hope for him.

  And he volunteered, on his own ac-
count. the information that the hand-bag.
which was largely responsible for the ac-
cident. had flown open on the line and let
out a shower of bank-notes and gold.
More than ten thousand pounds had been
counted by the railway officials who
had gathered it up. and there was quite
as much left in the bag. The messenger

had an idea. I think, that it had been
stolen from Carton, and that Diplock.
stopped in his intended flight of the
Continent with it by the accident, was
going to make confession to the man
he had robbed. But he did not find us
communicative, and we drove to the
hospital practically in silence.

  And at the hospital 1 was met by
the most exasperating incident of a
night that had not been without its
trials of patience. 1 had taken it for
granted that 1 should hear what Dip-
lock had to say, if he was still able to
say anything. Carton was anxious for
me to accompany him to the accident
ward, but it appeared I could not enter
because of some stupid red-tape rule of
the institution, against which I pitted
my eagerness to hear Diplock’s disclos-
ures in vain.

  1 was not a relative of the injured
man, and he had not asked to see me.
I could not even pretend that he wished
to see me. So the laws of the Medes
and Persians had decided long ago that
I must not step beyond the waiting-room,
and there 1 remained for an hour that
was as long as all the rest of the event-
ful night put together.

  I	believe that 1 paced up and down it
the whole time till Carton appeared
again, his face a little white and drawn;
but with all the nervous restlessness that
had characterized it gone.

  II	Well! that is all over." he said
quietly.

  “ He is dead? ”

  “ No. they think he may last an hour
or two more, but all the danger and
uncertainty that has been driving me
silly is at an.end now. He has told me
the whole plot. He did not know that
Sir Caleb Burnham was dead, and he said
that he wanted to ease his mind by
putting me on my guard against him.
But on my soul I believe that he really
told me because he was so proud of the
plot and did not want its cleverness to
l»e unrecognized.

  " He was just as keen on making his
confession when I told him that Burn-
ham had committed suicide, and he
wanted me to take possession of the
thirty thousand pounds he had in his
bag and keep half as a return for seeing
that the other half got to a sister of his
THE PACKING-CASK

723

in Edinburgh. Of course it will have to
go back to Burnham’s estate and help
meet his liabilities. Diplock puts them
at over a million.

  " But I can tell you everything as we
walk home. You don’t mind walking?
We can talk better and I have a lot to
tell you. The fellow was perfectly
conscious and clear, painfully so for a
man who knows that he has not six
hours at the utmost before him, and he
seemed keen on unbosoming himself.”

  The hour’s pause had enabled me to
realize that I was physically about
fagged out, but Carton seemed anxious
to walk and I was ready, tired as I was,
to do much more than that distance to
Chelsea to hear the solution of the
mystery.

  London was already beginning to be-
stir itself as we stepped out into the
street, ft was dark still, but a passing
milkman’s cart served as the first re-
minder that it was no longer night, but
the beginning of a new day.

  “ I think the Broadstairs crime will
be cleared up sufficiently to clear my
name and allow me to see Bleak
House after all,” Carton began as
we linked .arms and fell into step,
and I did not blame him for thinking
firstly how the disclosures he had heard
would affect himself.

  “ What Diplock has tokl me is not
evidence. I suppose, and I nearly choked
him off altogether by suggesting to have
somebody sent for to make it a sworn
statement. B^t he says the facts are
bound to come out, when Murgatroyd’s
brother in Australia hears of the affair.
That is what made Sir Caleb in such a
hurry to get things settled.”

  “ Then it was Burnham who threw
Murgatroyd over the cliff? ” I asked im-
patiently.

  " Yes, Sir Caleb Burnham, Baronet,
appears to be about the most colossal
hypocrite and impostor of the century,
and it does not make me particularly
comfortable to know that I have a face
like his. But if it proved that I have
his character latent in me, it would prove
too that I’d got his brains, and it is a
dead certainty that I haven’t.

  “ His companies are all part of one
big swindle, which each new one has
helped to support, and he has gone on

blowing the bubble bigger and bigger
till it was ready to burst. He was ma-
king preparations to save himself when
the burst came, but Murgatroyd turned
up before his preparations were com-
plete. Murgatroyd and his brother had
been partners with him in an undis-
covered swindle in the beginning of his
career, and had emigrated.

  “ They did badly and when they were
on their beam ends it occurred to them
that they might make money out of
Burnham by threatening to show up the
whole scandal. The one who was killed
came across for the purpose and arrived
at a moment when the bubble was near
bursting, and it needed only a suspicion
to bring about the catastrophe. Burn-
ham pretended to treat with him, and
made himself very agreeable, invited
him down to his place in Kent and took
him in his motor-car, with Diplock
driving. He took him down to the coast
deliberately and got him out there on the
pretence that the motor had broken down
and that they must find somebody to
repair it.

  “ Then the quarrel came and Murga-
troyd was thrown over the cliff, that be-
ing the easiest way to dispose of him.
When Burnham got rid of the fisher-
man who tried to secure him, he ran back
to the waiting motor, and they were in
town again before midnight. But fancy
the nerve of the fellow. He no sooner
reported himself in town with a view
to a possibly required alibi, than he
caught the midnight train back to the
neighborhood of the crime to get the
first news if anything threatened to in-
criminate him.

  “ Diplock, who lent himself to every
crime, seemed overwhelmed by admira-
tion of his master’s cleverness and audac-
ity, and I believe he is dying happy
because at the end lie managed to go
one better than his idol, and cheat the
cheater.

  “ But you are wondering why they
paid so much attention to me, Mr. Her-
bert. Well! Diplock says the idea was
his, and I believe his pride in it made
him tell me all about it. Sir Caleb’s
idea of meeting the cyclone which would
gather round him wherr the bubble at last
burst was to pretend suicide. He had
managed to secure about one hundred
724

THE AI. I ,-STOR V \I . AGAZ1N E

thousand pounds in cash and untraceable
notes, and his idea was to leave a sui-
cide's letter in his room and his hat and
coat on the edge of the river to satisfy
public opinion, while he disguised him-
self and commenced life anew some-
where under another identity.

  " The weak point of the scheme was
that it was too ostensible. The public
he had gulled would want better evi-
dence that he was really dead before
they would relinquish their efforts to
find and punish him. That is where I
and my wonderful resemblance came in.
When Sir Caleb hurried up to town with
the news of my arrest and discharge,
Diplock saw the possibilities at a
glance, and he has never lost sight of me
since. You see the idea, of course?

  “ When the public which the ‘ Chris-
tian Company-Promoter ’ had hood-
winked for so long discovered how he
had cheated them, nothing but the sight
of his dead body would satisfy them
that his pretended suicide was anything
more than another of his tricks. I was
to supply the dead body to make his
escape complete. On the night that I
was lured into his house without a soul
beyond Burnham, Diplock, and myself
knowing that we had ever met in
London, the thing was to be done.

  “ As soon as Diplock had returned
with my luggage and made sure that'
the people at Sartor Mansions would
not make inquiries about me when I
disappeared. I was to be offered Burn-
ham's own rooms. As soon as I had
undressed, he would come in to press a
last drink 011 me, and that last drink
would transform me from the living
Dudley Carton into the dead body of
Sir Caleb Burnham fpr the servants to
discover in the morning.

   “ What difference there is in our faces,
and I do flatter myself that I have a
different expression at any rate—would
be wiped out by death, and for the mat-
ter of that, who ever thinks of examining
the face or body of a man found dead
in his own bed to make sure that it is
really-he.

  “ Burnham would have had the rest
of the night to write his farewell letter,
appropriate my clothes and start off into
the world with the hundred thousand
pounds and a new identity. The original

idea had been for him to return to my
rooms in my clothes, spend the rest of
the night there, and settle up my bill
as though he were myself in the morning.
But the noticeable difference in our
voices, as well as my readiness to agree
to anything he proposed made him alter
Itis design while be talked to me. fortu-
nately for me.

  “ If he had not I should not be alive
now. Well! they found out that my
suspicions were aroused sufficiently to
make me avoid Burnham’s house, and
every day the bursting of the bubble
became more imminent. So they had to
satisfy themselves with a plan more
dangerous and clumsy. If I would not
go to Burnham's house, they must dis-
pose of me at some quiet spot where I
would go, and make arrangements for
getting my body to the house when I
was dead.

  “ They selected the garden of an
empty house belonging to Burnham,
thinking it would be near enough to my
own rooms to tempt me. and Diplock
wrote another anonymous letter to get
me there. Burnham was trying to throw
the whole burden on his accomplice's
shoulders. He kept his hold on Diplock
by promising him a third of his haul
after he had made his escape. But the
little man did not want to be left in the
lurch if anything went wrong. He was
willing to wait for me in the dark garden
and shoot me down with an air-pistol as
I entered. He considers himself to be
an unfailing shot. But Sir Caleb must
take the risk of getting the corpse back
to the house.

   '' Diplock would finish the long record
of dirty work he had done for his master
by committing a murder, but it was the
last stroke he would do. After that he
must think of saving himself, and for
that he would want his money. Burn-
ham had to accept the bargain! Diplock
was to kill me and receive his thirty
thousand pounds when he handed over
my dead body, for the other man to
dispose of at his own risk. And Dip-
lock swears he meant to keep the bar-
gain.

   “ It was not till he realized 'hat I was
not coming and an unfortunate cat got
on his nerves by raising an unearthly
caterwaul in the garden as if intent on

waking up everybody in the neighbor-
hood, and made him shoot it, that it
occurred to him to fool his confederate,
and get his money at any cost.

  “ The packing-case had been carted
into the garden two days earlier and lay
waiting with the lid and screws all ready,
and Diplock set tu work like a maniac
to (ill it up with earth and stones, think-
ing every moment, that Burnham would
be on the spot to spoil his stratagem.
But the last screw was in when he heard
the truck approaching and met Burnham
at the gate with the announcement that
the affair had succeeded perfectly.

  “ Burnham was horribly nervous, al-
though he had wheeled the truck all the
way from his house without' meeting a
soul, and he got more nervous still when
he saw the blood on the case. When he
found how heavy it was, he wanted Dip-
lock to help him, but Diplock had got his
money and kept him to his bargain.

  “ They were disputing about it when
you turned the corner of- the street and
put an end to their talk. As soon as you
had passed on, Diplock hurried to Char-\
ing Cross Station with his thirty thou-
sand pounds to try and catch the tidal
express, and met with, what, I suppose,
was just retribution. You will come in? ”

  To my surprise we were back already
at Sartor Mansions, and around us on the
Embankment lay the gray light of dawn.

  “ I rather think that it is time I was
going to bed," I said, and he walked on
with me to the door of my own chambers,
thanking me again without the least
suspicion of irony, I am sure, for the
immense amount of help I had given
him in solving the mystery.

  When he left me, 1 found myself al-
most too tired and sleepy to get up to my
room and undress, and I slept straight
away for a solid twelve hours. I might
probably have slept longer, but of the
many callers whom my man turned away
through the day, one, George Malcolm
of the Times, considered himself suf-
ficiently intimate to decide that twelve
hours’ sleep was enough for anybody.

  I woke as he entered my bedroom
bristling with newspapers.

  “ Look here,, old man,” he said,
■‘.haven't you looked at the papers yet? ”
I sat up rubbing my eyes.

  “ What, have the papers got hold of
it already?" I said, and Malcolm stared.

 “Already?” he laughed. “Why
every paper this morning had a glowing
account of it and the ‘ evenings ’ are out
now, following suit with, if possible,
more enthusiasm. They all agree that
it is a big success.”

  He was talking about my play.

  Yet, although nobody will believe me,
any more than Malcolm did, I had for-
gotten all about it.

How a man, for cruelty and
falsehood, was repaid a thou-

T was after dinner, and the men were
smoking in a small red room off the
dining-room. They had been talk-
ing of a monstrous, inexplicable
rime which had staggered humanity,
ml which had left its print on every

one's mind. The story had just been
told with all its gruesome details, and
the five men were digesting it with twist-
ed faces, as after a bad draft.

  Finally the youngest man spoke.

  " There is an explanation to every-
thing." he said. “ Everything, no mat-
ter how strange or mysterious it be, has
perhaps the simplest explanation. ’

  He paused to relight his cigarette, and
then lifted his eyes' to the faces of the
men around him.

  “ Perhaps the doctor does not agree

with you." ore of the men suggested,
noticing the thoughtful look on the man's
face.

  '■ Yes,” the doctor returned, “ I do. I
believe that statement is true. I think
almost everything has an explanation.
1 say almost, because once or twice things
occur in the lives of men which seem so
closely associated with the supernatural,
so interwoven with mystery, that it ap-
pears impossible to account for them by
natural means.

  “ You talk as if sue., a thing had oc-
curred in your life,” the first man said.

  The doctor took a long pull at his
cigar, then continued:

  “ 1 had an experience once that I
could not unravel, and that has puzzled
me to this day. It came near bring-
ing me to the murderers’ dock, and yet
the explanation given at the time seemed
to have satisfied all those who heard it.
But to me it was insufficient; there was
something lacking. If you wish, 1 will
tell it to you.’’

  Several of the men spoke at once.

  “ Do so by all means,” they said.

  After a short pause, the doctor began:

  '' It was some time ago. just after the
Civil War, in 1867. I was then serving
as a resident in the Pencoyd Hospital.
At that time there were three of us. who
lived in the hospital—Alfred Jordan,
Francis Dalphine, and myself. Alfred
Jordan this story does not concern.
Francis Dalphine, however. I wish to
describe to you, as he was one of the
principals in the events I am about to
relate.

  “ He was from New Orleans, and con-
tained in his appearance that mixture of
the French and Southern blood which is
so characteristic.

  “In person he was lean and long, with
a swarthy, delicate face, a broad, rather
bulging brow, and jet-black curling hair.
A good-looking fellow enough, save for
a peculiar leer about his mouth-corners.
This man was to me particularly dis-
tasteful. and I never saw good qualities
and bad ones so sadly mixed.

  “ His habits were loose and coarse to
a degree, yet his desires were withheld
with that modicum of prudence which
keeps a man from inconvenient drunk-
enness or discovered theft. Pie wore an
easy air nf tolerance and self-assurance.

due. perhaps, to the consciousness of his
own mental ability, which was marked;
for his mind was fine and clear, though
unclean.

  “ He had an especial turn for surgery,
and his longing for knowledge in this
branch of medicine burned with the same
furious flame as his baser desires, and
was only quenched when his object was
secured. It was this desire—this at-
tempt—to satisfy his surgical curiosity
regardless of consequences that led to the
tragedy I am about to relate.

  “ It seems that late one night, just
after my arrival at the hospital, two
Chinamen walked into the receiving
ward; one was suffering from a bad
cold, the other acted as interpreter.
Dalphine had given the sick man some
medicine or other, and was about to send
him away, when he noticed a lump on
his arm. large enough to be seen through
the loose coat the Chincman wore.

  " lie made the man disrobe, and found
a tumor on the arm near the shoulder.
Through the interpreter he insisted that
the Chinaman spend the night in the
hospital.

  "In the morning, he asked me to ex-
amine the arm with him. I was sur-
prised at the appearance of the China-
man. He was evidently of the upper
class, and not the low-caste coolie that

I	expected to see. His face .was intelli-
gent, his clothes were the finest quality
of silk, and he had the long, uncut fin-
ger-nails which in that race denote lux-
ury and freedom from work. A fine
gold chain hung around his neck, and a
massive gold ring of curious design
adorned one of his fingers.

  " He bared his arm, and I examined
it carefully. The tumor was a large
one, and seemed firmly attached. I
thought it was a cancerous growth, and
told Dalphine so, and asked him if he
had suggested an operation.

  “ ‘ That is why I sent for you.' he ex-
plained. ' I need help to get his con-
sent. You see, it's a good operation, and
if I work it right I can do it myself.’

-	“ ‘ But it’s an amputation.' I said.
'Will Smith let you do it?'

  “‘Now, mind you.’ Dalphine re-
turned, ‘ I am telling nothing to Smith.
This is my case and I do it myself. You
keep your mouth shut, do you see?’
THE CELESTIAL PERFUME.

  “ I was green and timid and awed by
Dalphine’s manner, so said nothing.

  “ ‘ Now, go aliead,’ said Dalpliine,
' and explain to them what has to be
done. I have already told them, but
I think you can clinch the matter.’

  " I turned to the interpreter, and told
him at some length' the dangerous con-
dition the man was in—how an opera-
tion would have to he performed, and
how death would ensue if it was refused.

  “ This was transmitted rapidly to the
patient, who received it in silence. Fi-
nally he spoke shortly, and the interpre-
ter turned to me.

  ‘‘‘He wishes to know if he loses his
arm.’

  “ Dalpliine heard the question; pull-
ing me aside, he exchanged a sharp look.

  “ ‘ These heathens,’ he whispered,
‘ have a belief that if their arms or legs
are taken off before death they will ap-
pear in hell or heaven without them.
Now, I want you to tell this man that
we can take this tumor off without his
arm. Of course, if anything happens
at the operation that makes amputation
necessary, we can tell him afterward.’

  “ * But it seems to me,’ I said sharply,
' that this will he necessary. The tumor
so involves the bone that I do not think
it can he removed without the arm.’

  “ ‘ You won’t tell him that? ’ Dalphine
said quickly.

  “ ‘ I can’t honestly tell him anything
else,’ I replied. ‘ Besides that, you
should let Smith see him.’

  “ 'No. I will not,’ Dalphine returned.

*	Smith is a blundering old woman, and

I	intend doing this myself. If you are
going to mix things up, you had better
not tell the Chinaman anything.’

  “ ‘ Very 'Veil,’ I said angrily. ‘ Do
as you please.’

  11	And with that I left him.

  “ I did not find out till the next day
what arrangements Dalphine had made.
He sent for me to etherize, and I found
the Chinaman and the interpreter in a
small room off the operating-chamber.
Before I began the Chinaman sent for
Dalghine, who came with sleeves rolled
up, a'rubber apron on, andfiis hands cov-
ered with soap-suds.

  “‘What is it?’ Dalphine said, look-
ing at me. I pointed to the interpreter,
who spoke.

  “ ‘ He says you promised not to take
off his arm; because, he says, he would
rather die than lose his arm.’

  “ ‘ All right,' Dalphine said hurriedly,
and turned to go.

  “ The sick man rose up in bed. caught
Dalphine by the arm, and rattled a few
sentences to the interpreter, who again
spoke to Dalphine.

  “ 1 He wishes you to promise on vour
God.’

  “ ‘ All right,’ Dalphine said, looking
at me with his peculiar leer. ‘ I prom-
ise, on my God.’

  “ This was told the.. Chinaman, who
sank back, apparently satisfied.

  “To say 1 was disgusted with the
whole affair was but putting it mildly,
and yet it was Dalphine’s concern, and
not mine. He was my senior, and to
him I believed all the blame belonged.
Since that time 1 have thought I should
have interfered and told the Chinaman
what would probably happen, hut I did
not.

  “ 1 had some trouble in getting the
Chinaman to take the anesthetic, but his
friend and I finally persuaded him.
The smell of the ether was to me a re-
lief, for the Chinaman had about him a
peculiar musk-like perfume that per-
meated the room and was very unpleas-
ant.

  “ The operation was done well. I.
have seldom seen one done with more
despatch or more skilfully. When Dal-
phine found, by an incision, where the
tumor went, spreading its ramifications
into muscles and the very bone itself, he
did not hesitate, but. looking at me,
asked how the patient was doing. I
answered that he was all right.

  “ ‘ Then,’ he said, ‘ this arm comes off
at the shoulder.’

  “ I paled over the ether.

  “ ‘ Surely you cannot do this thing
after your promise,’ I said. ' Much bet-
ter let him die.’

  “ ‘ This arm comes off at the shoulder,’
he repeated, and that was all, while I
continued to ply the ether, with repul-
sion in my heart for so vile a beast,
knowing well that if I threw down the
towel and refused to continue he would
press the orderly into my place, with per-
haps disastrous results.

  “ At last it was over. The severed
728

arm was slipped in a jar of alcohol, for
Dalphine to examine at leisure, and the
poor devil placed in his bed.

  •'Never shall 1 forget the Chinaman
after the operation. He was heavy with
ether all the afternoon, hut toward night
he became gradually conscious and anx-
ious to know the result of the operation.
1 happened to be in the ward when his
friend was asking Dalphine about it, and
from a point of vantage by an alcove
could take in the whole scene without
being observed.

  “The Chinaman, his green face im-
movable as a statue, had been propped
up slightly with a pillow, and the quick
glances from his rat-like eyes at Dal-
phine were the only evidence he gave
of any agitation. Bluntly and cruelly
Dalphine told how, at the operation, the
arm had been taken off. I could hear
his loud but rounded voice roll through
the ward, and then, to make matters
worse, he said that the growth was a
cancer, and that the Chinaman would
probably die.

  11	This was interpreted to the China-
man and I watched his face as he re-
ceived it. His expression did not change,
but he gave the surgeon a look of such
intense hatred and loathing as I have
never seen, and which made Dalphine
pale beneath his dusky skin.

  “ The evening of that day Dalphine
was off duty, and Alfred Jordan having
left the hospital on account of sickness,
it fell to my lot to see the Chinaman.
He seemed to be in good shape, and gave
no evidence of the pain which he must
have been suffering. He had not changed
his position, and his face wore the same-
rigid. impenetrable expression.

  “ Before leaving the ward, as I was
giving some directions to the nurse the
man in the next bed called to me.

     Doctor,’ he said, ‘ can’t you move
that Chinaman out of here? He smells
like a drug-store, and makes me sick.’

  “ ‘ He is annoying all the patients,’
the nurse said. ‘ They have complained
continually since he has been in the ward
of that offensive perfume. We could
move him into the end room.’ she sug-
gested. ‘ There is no one there.’

  “ I agreed to her proposal, and left
the ward for the night.

     Toward one o’clock ^received a note

from the nurse saying that the Chinaman
was doing badly, and would 1 see him.
I hurriedly dressed and went to the ward.

  “ The nurse met me in the hall, out-
side of the end room. Site told me that
a short time before she had gone to the
Chinaman's bed to give him some milk.
He looked all right, perhaps a trifle
paler, but his eyes seemed lifelike and his
expression had not changed. It was only
when she tried to rouse him that she
discovered something was wrong; he
was not breathing, and his pulse had
disappeared.

  “ 1 went to the bed with her, and
found, as she had surmised, that the Chi-
naman was dead. Lifting the bedclothes.
1 discovered that the mattress was soaked
with blood. When I examined the man's
shoulder I found that' the bandages had
all been pulled away and a ligature torn
from the main artery.

  “ The Chinaman had worked the
dressings off. loosened a ligature, and
quietly bled to death. 1 gave some di-
rections in regard to the removal of the
body and started for bed. As 1 was
leaving the ward I encountered Dal-
phine, who was evidently quite intoxi-
cated.

  •‘‘How are things?' he asked me
thickly, steadying himself against the
door.

  “ ‘ That Chinaman of yours is dead.’
I answered shortly. : I have just seen
him.'

  " He said nothing, but went stagger-
ing into the ward.

  “ As I was undressing 1 heard him
come blundering down the hall and go
to his room.

  “Presently he called me:

   “ ‘ Preston, come in here a moment.'

  “ He was sitting on a chair in front
of the bureau when I entered, and as he
faced me I saw that something had
shaken him. The Hush of the alcohol
had left his face; he was as white as
paper.

  “ 1 Preston,' he began, ‘ that damned
Chinaman bit me.’

   “ ‘ Bit you! ’ I cried, staring into his
bloodshot eyes.

   “ ‘ Yes, bit me,’ he repeated.

  “ He clumsily unraveled a handker-
chief about his hand and held it to my
face. Two fingers were running blood.
  “ * You’re a good diagnostician.* he
mumbled. ' I wen: ia to see him when
I left you. and was examining the shoul-
der. when I knocked the candle over.
While I was hunting for i- in the dark
I stack my hand in his face, and he
bit me like a dog.'

  •• • Xoosense:' I said; 'it isn’t pos-
sible. The mar. is dead.'

  • You’re right. Preston: he said stu-
pidly. ' He is dead now, at any rate. 1
beat him over the head till he let go.'

  " ‘ Dalphine. you’re drunk.' I re-
marked. ' You had better go to bed.
You rut your hand n something.'

  “- I know I'm drunk.- he muttered.

*	But. Pfeston. he bit me: I know that,
too.'

  " He rabbed his hand over his mouth,
ar.d suddenly tc-ok it away 3nd looked
at it.

  '■ ‘ God! I smell like a sachet powder.
Well, good night: here goes for bed.'

  " He attempted to get up from the
chair, slipped, and fell fiat on the
ground, where he lay. breathing heavily.
I dragged him on to his bed. loosened his
collar, and removed his shoes, but be-
fore leaving the room I untied his hand.

  “ On two fingers were deep and bleed-
ing indentations of human teeth.

  “ The next day he was about his work
a- usual. I asked him how his hand
was. and he replied that he had cut it
on something the night before, but made
no mention of the bite, nor did I attempt
to question him further.

    Xo one came to claim the body of
the Chinaman. His friend who acted
a- interpreter was never seen again, so
he wa- buried in the Potter's Field.

  " It chanced that one night, not long
afterward, I went to the museum, where
the specimens were preserved, to examine
a thoracic aneurism which I had been
dissecting.

  “ The museum, in those days, occu-
pied the basement of an old house, which
was apart from the hospital, in the midst
of a clump of trees to one comer of the
grounds. The upper part of this house
had been used formerly t-.- isolate con-
tagious casts, but had long since been
abandoned, on account of the dilapi-
dated condition of the walls and the
impossibility of heating the upper story.

  " It was a fine frosty night in Decem-

ber. with a thin, bright moonlight and
a sharp wind, which buffeted the small
lantern I carried and had swept the
brick pavements as clean as a ballroom
door. I entered the building, and turn-
ing, locked the door firmly behind me;
for on other occasions I had had some
street-prowlers vault the low fence
around the grounds, open the door, and
watch me with morbid curiosity.

  " The museum was a large room, di-
vided by a long case of shelves, which
extended from ceiling to floor, across the
'.-enter of the room, leaving just enough
space at each end for passageways This
case was filled with specimens, as were
the shelves lining the sides the r
< *ne of these shelves was protected wit:
a hinged glass cover, fastened with a
padlock, and was the only place where
specimens were secure from the meddle-
some medical students who studied there-
at times.

  “ After I had placed the lantern on
the table at the end of the room and
lighted a ’amp I unlocked the shelf
which held my specimen. There were
eight or ten jars on this shelf, ea rh con-
taining some portion of -he human anat-
omy. preserved in alcohol. Among them
I recognized the arm of the Chinaman,
which Dalphine had placed there for ex-
amination.

  "The fingers, with their long nai;>.
were curled up over the palm, and 1
noticed with surprise that the g id ring
still encircled the swollen finger and
glittered through the jar in the lamp-
light.

  ' 1 brought out my specimen, placed
it on the table, and started to work.

  “ I don't know why it was. but I was
unsuccessful. I could not get my mind
on the task 1 had been then- perhaps
an hour, when I felt the room grow cold
and a Mast of chill air came sweeping
around the case of shelves. Taking a
lantern' I advanced from the table and
discovered, to my amazement, t’iat the
door was wide open.

  ' You can judge of my surprise. ior
I was positive that I had i eked :v. r

smell. Subtle at first, it became more
pronounced as I returned to the table.
Then suddenly I recognized it—the sin-
gular musk-like odor the Chinaman had
borne before death.

  " I was not easily frightened in those
days, but I must confess I felt a creep-
ing chill crawl through my bones and a
weight of utterly causeless alarm grip
me by the heart. I placed myself again
at the table, attempted to work, and tried
to banish the sensation of fear which was
pervading me, but all to no purpose.
This constant pungent smell made me
uncomfortable, and, to add to it, I had
an odd subjective sensation, accompanied
by a sinking of the pulse, that there was
somebody in the room with me.

  “ This idea became so firm,, so con-
vincing, that I felt sure that the thing,
whatever it was, was behind the case,
which threw its shadow blackly on the
floor. It was as if something had gath-
ered there—something I had great rea-
son to fear, some peculiar thing that
would harm me, how or why I could not
tell.

  “ I endeavored to reason off my nerv-
ousness ; I endeavored to believe that
much, if not all, of what I felt was due
to the oppressive influence of the gloomy
room, the isolated building, and the hour
of the'night, but the more I struggled
the more panic-stricken I became, and
had to restrain myself by a strong force
of will from grasping the lantern and
rushing from the building. During this
struggle against my fears I sat staring
at the table with the sweat running down
my face and neck, overpowered with hor-
ror, unaccountable, yet unendurable.

  “ The very fact that there was nothing
tangible to frighten me, I think, added
to my terror, for if I had seen or heard
anything it would have relieved the ten-
sion.

  “ Finally I did hear something—a
faint tinkle, a soft click of steel striking
steel. I looked to where the sound came
from and saw, as plainly as I see your
faces, the keys in the locked case turn-
ing-

  “ The tension broke like a snapped
wire, and I rushed to the case and pulled
them from the lock. I imagined they
were held from me by a soft force, as
if some one had a finger in the key-ring

and was gently restraining me from ta-
king them. 1 jammed them in my pock-
et, and taking the lamp, went around
the case. The golden rays illuminated
thoroughly the space beyond the case.

   “ There was nothing there, but 1 no-
ticed that the smell here was stronger,
and I had a sensation of nausea from it,
as I had had the day of the operation. I
blew out the lamp, and holding the lan-
tern on high, fled from the building.

   " The cold night-air settled me some-
what. but I could not shake off the sen-
sation that the thing had followed me,
and looked back time and again to re-
assure myself.

  “ That night 1 could not sleep for
some time, but tossed about with a troub-
led mind while the hours waned away.
I had received a shock that seemed en-
tirely disproportionate to actual occur-
rences, and one that had shaken my
nerves badly. The death of .the China-
man and the thought, which I know will
seem foolish to you, that he was seeking
his lost arm, kept running through my
mind.

   “ Finally, toward morning, I fell into
a disturbed sleep. Half asleep. 1 thought
a figure entered my room. I called to
it, thinking it was Dalphine, but re-
ceived no answer. Again I smelled the
musty odor and attempted to awaken my-
self, for the insidious perfume was cho-
king me. The figure went to the table,
and I heard the rattle of the keys as
they were turned, as I imagined, in an
effort to remove one from the ring. I
awoke with a cry and found Dalphine
standing by my bed.

  “ Dawn was making things plain in
my room, and Dalphine, with blue shad-
ows about his mouth, looked wan and
ghastly in the faint light. Of the two
of us, he looked the more frightened.

   “ ‘ What’s the matter with you ? ’ he
asked. 'Did you call? Did you see
anything? ’

   “ ‘ No,' I said, collecting myself. ' 1
had a dream, that’s all.’

  " He went to the window and opened

 it.

      It's awful close in here,' he said.
■‘What’s that sickening smell?’

“ I could smell it, too, as the fresh
air from the window drove it tpward me.
" ‘ It was in my room last night,’ he
THE CELESTIAL PERFUME

   said, turning from the window. ‘ And
   say, Preston.’ lie said irritably, before lie
   left me. * if you have any more dreams
   don't make so much noise about them.'

     “ After that night the ordinary pro-
   cession of events in the hospital under-
   went a change—everything seemed to go
   wrong. Something strange . was about,
   and 1 had a queer feeling of foreboding
   which I have heard precedes a calamity.
   We began to lose case after case without
   apparent cause, and if there was a chance
   for the most benign disease to become
   fatal it would certainly do it.

     " Sometimes I thought I detected the
   peculiar odor in the ward. I don’t know
   whether it was my imagination or not.
   but it seemed to always precede a death,
   and filled me with the same horror 1 had
   ' experienced in the museum. Once or
   twice-things were seen by patients, but 1
   gave little credence to them.

     “ Dalphine and I at that time were
   living in rooms at the end of a long one-
   story ward of the hospital. All the pa-
   tients had been removed from this wing
   temporarily, as the ward was being
   cleaned and plastered. It was a cold,
   cheerless place to live in. There was no
   heat, save from a broken-down stove,
   which stood in the hall and served for
   both rooms, but only partially counter-
   acted the cold blasts which came through
   the ill-fitting window-sashes.

     " That we were not the only occupants
   of this wing soon became evident. There
   was something that was always looking
   over my shoulder when I read, or was
   waiting in the shadow of my room at
   dusk, and when 1 walked down the long
   empty ward, which adjoined our rooms,
   to make ifv evening rounds it would fol-
   low me Ivith light pattering footsteps.
   It was Continually fumbling my keys,
   and after I had retired I could hear the
   bunch tinkle cautiously on the bureau.

     “ In my sleep. 1 imagined that the
   thing wished something it could not get.
   and was reproaching me with soft, blun-
   dering murmurs, which would at last
   awake me. and then go sighing down
   the corridor with the wind, ('nee I
   heard, or imagined 1 heard, it crying out
   in the hall, weeping like a woman, and
   1 awoke with great pity in my heart.

     “ I was not the only one who thought
   something strange was going on.

    My dog, which was a large terrier
and had always slept in my room at
night, refused to remain there, preferring
the cold outside to the strange visitor.
Sometimes I could coax him in, but lie
was uneasy, and with hair uplifted on
his back and muscles tense would watch
the thing in the dark hall, growling, with
his teeth barfed under his lips.

  “ That Dalphine noticed something
was wrong 1 have no doubt. He never
spoke to me in this regard, but 1 noticed
that he was greatly changed and went
about as if some terrible weight was op-
pressing him. There were times, indeed,
when I thought his unceasingly agitated
mind was laboring with some oppressive
secret, to divulge which he struggled for
the necessary courage. He looked ghast-
ly, and his heavy-skinned face was the
color of cigar-ash and creased with deep
lines.

  “ He began to drink harder, and time
and time again I could hear him in the
dead of night talking quickly, as if lie
was quarreling with some one.

  “ One morning early he awoke me and
accused me of going through his pockets
in search of the keys he had borrowed
the night before.

  “ ‘ Preston. L want you to keep out
of my room at night.’ he said.

  “ I told him I had not been in his
room.

  “ ‘ Well, some one has,’ he continued.
1 They are after those keys.’

  “ He slapped the bunch on the table.

  “ ' And look here,’ lie added, drawing
a revolver. ‘ Some one has been annoy-
ing me—some devilish joke or other—
and the next time it happens 1 am going
to put a bullet through him. whoever
he is.’

  '• As I marked his trembling hand and
startled face it was easy to sec that his
air of bravado was feigned, and that be-
neath it the man was mortally shaken—
frightened almost beyond endurance.

  “ In the evening of that day he came
to my room. He bad got himself to-
gether somewhat, looked better, and was
perfectly sober.

  “ ‘ I am sorry I acted the ass this
morning,’ he said. 1 I was in a bad
funk—rum. I guess, and nerves and no
sleep. I want to take those museum keys
again.’

  “ As 1 handed them to him I noticed
he had a small file in his hand : he saw
the direction of my glance, and explained
that he was going to file off the gold
ring on the severed hand in the museum.

  “‘It is too valuable to be allowed to
remain where it is.' he said, ‘ and I am
going to have it in payment, you know,
for the operation.’

  “ He bade me good night and left
me. After he had gone I went to the
gate-house and got my dog. Singularly
enough, he seemed willing to come to
my room, and instead of sniffing all
around and nervously growling he con-
tentedly curled himself up near my chair.

  " At twelve o’clock—I marked the
time exactly, for I remember setting my
watch by the city clock, whose bell car-
ried to me from the next square—I left
my room with the dog. intending to take
a walk about the grounds before turn-
ing in.

  “ It was a black winter's night, cold
and raw. with no wind, but a dampness
which felt like snow at any moment.
The slight snow of the day before had
drifted into small heaps on the grass and
in corners, and was frozen into a thin
crust on the pavement, which made walk-
ing hazardous. There were no noises
of carts and pedestrians in the streets.
The restless grumble of traffic seemed
to have gone down with the wind.
Sounds carried far and clear, and the
closing of a shutter in the hospital rang
out sharply in the night.

  “ My walk led me toward the museum,
with my dog pattering at my heels. I
don't know what prompted me, but as
1 came closer I paused in my walk be-
fore turning back and watched Dalphine.
whom I could see plainly through the
lighted window. He was bent over, and

I	judged, from the movement of his
arm, that he was filing the ring.

  “ Suddenly he ceased working and
lilted his head, as if he had heard some-
thing. He stood for a few seconds mo-
tionless. apparently listening, and then
quickly turned, and lifting his hands
in front of his face, as if to ward off
something, staggered back against the ta-
ble and sent it, with the lamp, crashing
to the ground. That one instant, when
T -aw the hormr of his face, will haunt
me io rav dving dav.

   “ 1 stood rigid. a> if paralyzed, looking
with staring eyes at the black window;
the next moment, a thin cry came from
the museum. It went down my spine
like ice and touched the marrow of my
bones. A cry at first broken and muffled,
like the sobbing of a child, which quickly
swelled into one long, loud, inhuman
screech and then abruptly ceased.

  “ I started on a run for the museum,
and threw myself against the door. It
was unlocked, and I burst suddenly
in. A dense, disgusting, musklike odor
greeted my nostrils.

     Dalphine,’ I shouted; there was no
response from the blackness save the
growling of my dog. which had fol-
lowed me.

  “ I groped my way to the case and
then around it, with hands stretched out
to protect me from I knew not what,
and stumbled and fell over something.

  “ Kneeling, I felt about and placed
my fingers on a human face, still warm,
but quiet and lifeless. I shuddered, and
drew back with repulsion, for 1 knew
instinctively that the thing was dead.
My hand went for the heart, and I
found its pulsation gone, and then I
felt for the neck, to unloosen the collar,
when I touched an ice-cold hand, which
grasped the'dead man's throat.

  “ 1 Oh, God! ’ I cried, and ‘ Oil,
God! ’ again, and staggered upright,
when something came toward me that

I	could not see, but could feel with a
deep-seated terror of the mind, some-
thing that gathered itself out of the
blackness, and although I knew I was
in danger, I could not move a muscle or
utter a sound; and then, js I stood there,
this thing enveloped m«. and a hand
seized me by the throat bore me to
the ground.

  “ I struggled and grasped its wet and
slimy wrist and struck out with my feet
for its body, but the thing which had
me by the throat had no connection witfh
a human frame, for my feet went through
thin air.

  11	At that instant my dog sprang for
my throat. I felt his jaws close on
something fastened to my neck, and his
hot breath in my face, but the cold clam-
like fingers only pressed the tighter,
tvhile my head swam with retained blood
and I fell my senses gradually leave inc.
I'HK CELESTIAL PERFUME.

Then, indistinctly, I heard a voice and
dimly perceived a light; the grasp re-
laxed. and' T became unconscious for a
moment.

  “ When I recovered myself I was
lying on the floor in one corner. The
room was lighted by a lantern, which
had been placed near me by the watch-
man, who was bending over me. and who
helped me to my feet.

  “1 Wait a moment,’ 1 said, leaning
against the wall, as lie started to ques-
tion me. ' let me pull myself together.’

  “ The watchman glanced about the
room, and started back with a half-cry
when he saw the body for the first time.

  “ It lay on its back, with one hand
clenched and rigid at its throat. In its
staring eyes and black and swollen face
was written fear, such terror as no one
can describe, which drove the color from
the watchman’s cheek as he peered into
the dead man’s face.

  “ ‘ My God! it’s Doctor Dalphine,’
he said hoarsely, and then, noticing the
black marks on the throat, cried out that
he had been choked to death. I nodded
my head and rubbed my neck, which was
stiff and sore.

  “ The grumbling and growling of the
dog, which was worrying something in
the corner, attracted his attention. He
took the lamp and went toward the dog,
and seizing him by the neck, drove him
off. The dog came to me whining.

  “ ‘ Look at what he’s been at.’ the
watchman said.

  “ I came over to him. still dazed, and
saw him lift the severed arm; I righted
the table and we placed, the arm on it.
The hand was, torn and shredded by the
dog’s teeth.

   “ 1 It’s the arm he was dissecting.' I
mumbled, and shivered as with a chill.

  “‘Morse, did you hear him cry?’ I
asked.

   “ * Hear him? ' he said ; 1 I never heard
the like. Aye, I heard him. I can hear
him now. Oil, Lord, what a cry! '

  “ He wiped his handkerchief over his
face, which was wet with sweat, although
the room was cold as a vault.

  “ * I was just coming out of the main
building.’ he continued, ‘ when I heard
it. and turned and saw you running.’

  “ ‘ Thank God for that,; I said, com-
ing more to myself.

  “‘For what?’ he questioned.

     That you saw me. Don’t you see,
man, it lifts murder from my soul. You
find me here.’ I continued, ‘ with a man
choked to death, no one else about.
\\ hat’s to prevent you and every one
thinking that I killed him? But you
saw me running after he cried out—don't
forget that, Morse—and you followed
me in and found me unconscious and
Dr. Dalphine dead. You'll have to tell
that to the coroner.'. *

     Why,’ the watchman said. ' doctor,
you don’t suppose any one would think
you killed him? Look there!’ He point-
ed to a window at the end of the room
which was wide open.”

  The doctor paused in his story; his
voice was hoarse, and he drank eagerly
from a glass of water on the table.

  “ And now comes the explanation,” he
continued.

  “In those days, in the basement of
the Pencoyd Flospital were a number of
rooms where the insane were confined.
That night, just before Dalphine was
killed, Morse, the watchman, found that
an insane patient, James Long, had
broken open the door of his room and
escaped. He was a dangerous lunatic,
with homicidal mania.

  “ Morse was looking for him when he
heard Dalphine’s cry. He thought the
madman had raised the window in the
rear of the museum, entered quietly, and
strangled Dalphine and attacked me.
The solution seemed more than plausible,
for on coming from the building after
arranging Dalphine’s body we found the
lunatic crouching in the corner of the
steps. We overpowered him with diffi-
culty and again placed him in his room.

  “ Of course, there was great excite-
ment the next day as the story of the
murder leaked out. The coroner's jury,
after an exhaustive inquiry, came to the
conclusion that Dalphine had been killed
by James Long, the lunatic. The state-
ment of the watchman completely exon-
erated me, but I think that if he had not
seen me running toward the museum
after Dalphine cried out it might have
been a nasty business

  “ Strange as it may seem, the arm dis-
appeared during the night. The coroner
and police did not give any weight to
this fact. I searched the museum and
THE ALL-STORY MAGAZINE

the grounds- about thoroughly, but could
no; find it; nor was it ever again seen in
the hospiial.

  •	A? I said in the beginning, this ex-
i.:’nation seemed satisfactory to all who
heard it, and 1 have n doubt will seem
so to you; hut to me there was something
else—something that only 1, who had
gone through such an experience, can ap-
preciate.

  ‘ There is only one other thing con-
nected with this singular occurrence, and
then I am done.

  " Three years ago it was decided to
remove all tubercular cases from the
city hospital. For this purpose a large
plot o: ground was purchased, in order
ti- build a new hospital for them. I was
one of the committee for the erection of
this building. The spot chosen was a
large pauper burying-ground on the out-
>k-ns of the city, which had been in dis-
use for some time.

   One day. while I was overlooking
the work, I was standing near some v. ork-
men. wh?r-;- texcavation was taking
place, watching them remove a coffin,
the top of which suddenly gave way and
exposed the skeleton within. I climbed
d<-wc freon where 1 was standing to get
a clear view of the remains, which I
feund to be these of a Chinaman. From
the naked skull was still attached a long
jet-black queue.

  “ All the bodies that had been disin-
terred were placed in a shed awaiting
transportation to another burying-

ground. After this coffin had been
placed w^h the rest 1 went over alone

and, lifting the cover, iooked carefully
within. The body had evidently been
despoiled by those who buried it, for the
bones lay naked in the wooden box.

  “ One of the arms was broken off
clean, near the shoulder, as if the bone
had been sawed through. I lifted the
hand that was flexed on the forearm and
straightened out the fingers, which were
clenched in the palm. A large gold ring
dropped from the bony finger to the bot-
tom of the coffin.

  “ I picked it up: n was half filed
through.

  " Gentlemen. 1 gave you an explana-
tion of the first part of my story.

  “ To this last, I give you none.”

  “ But the ring.” one of the men said
—“what became of it?r’

  The doctor withdrew one end of his
watch-chain from his pocket and ms-
clasped the heavy gold ring.

  “ There it is." he said, placing it on
the table.

  The window in the room was open
and a soft summer breeze was blowing
die curtains.

  The man near the window sniffed.

  “ Do you notice a peculiar smell com-
ing through that window?'' he asked.

  The doctor smiled and said:

  “ My story has made a great impres-
sion: does it smell like musk? "

  But presently he arose and closed the
window quickly.

  “ Our show was this kind of a show—
a refined black-face vawdeveal, with
mimical jolly isms and a wire act on the
side. We had a little menagerie, too;
there was a gray wolf, some coon-cats,
dyed with anil in dyes and billed as Cir-
cassian tigrettes. and a Canady link.
Which the link was that moth-eaten you
couldn’t have taken your oath whether it
was a naturally bald beast with oasises
of fur or vicky-verky. We had a wall-
eyed bear, too, named Miltiades—dys-
peptic he was, and pessimistic on account
of a bad cough. Besides all these, there
was a dummy stuffed to reppesent a Pole
Nihilist, Shawl-grots or Saw-grass, or
some such name.

  “ For humans there was me and Eb
(my brother), plus a couple of kids
named McCarty, but billed as the Angelo
Freres. plus 1 Kid ' Nagle, the six-hand-
ed bag-puncher, and a slim Paderewsky
named Jefferson Figg, what tortured the
fiddle and played the bass-drum-cymbal
combination with his knees, plus Bill
Macklin. who manipulated the horse-
teeth of our vest-pocket melodeon.

  “ Bill was a curly-headed, good lookin'
Britisher from Leeds. Which we called
him the Leeds Duck because the organ-
bellerses was that small he had to pump
one hundred and twenty to the minute,
like a sure-enough duck’s paddle-wheels
navigatin’ a mill-pond.

  “ Add to the above ‘ Peg ’ Wilkins,
which is our adipose advance agent, with
a real genius for alcohol and with a
mahogany leg, the same bein’ as fine a
piece of wood-turnin’ as ever I see. and
you have the toot ensimble of Burdock’s
Amalgamated Australian and Diamond
Musee.

  “ We toured the Granite State, and for
a while did a land-office biz, playin' on
velvet to A1 houses. Unfortunately, it
didn’t last. Nope; when we crossed
over into N. H. and tried to string up
there, somethin' solid fell on us in the
shape of an injunction bought and paid
for by a sure-enough circus in the next
county.

  “ You’ve got to have a thousand-dollar
license to exhibit a circus in little old
N. H., a slight detail we wasn’t wise to.
So, as per above, this here injunction
drops on us like a pint of half-melted
ice-cream down a fat man’s osteopathy.

  “ Lawyers and sheriffs swarmed round
the Amalgamated for a spell like a
queen-bee’s weddin’; but, though Her-
mann and us was handy with the jaw-
tackle, we'didn’t really have a look-in at
the game at all, bein’ tied to the post
as compared with the red-tape men when
it come to a legal show-down.

  "‘It ain’t a circus at all that we’re
exhibitin’! ’ is our contention. ‘ With-
out equine equilibration, how d’ you
make a circus out "of us? ’

  “‘You’ve got a ’reener. ain't you?’
says the law-buzzards.

  “ ‘ Um-m-m. yes; but what’s that got
to do with it?’

  “ ‘ Makes it a circus, that’s all a
Teener does. A ’reener’s a ’reener. and
you’re a circus and wfe can prove it.’ re-
peats the law'-buzzards. 1 Put up a thou-
sand or quit the State.’

  “ So we quit.

  “ Well, first thing we done after trav-
el in’ away from them unsalubrious re-
gions was take account of stock. What
with salaries, transportation, and el cet.,
we’s up against three hundred of debt,
and our cash assets is thirty-nine-sixty.
The stock-takin’ developed into a coun-
cil of wrar, blue bein’ the prevailin' color.
Which it would have been far, far more
of a frosty-phiz party if we’d been wise
to the kind of jiu-jitsu package Fate had
ribbed up to hand us before long.

  “ The decision we reached was this
kind of a decision:

  “ Hermann was to hustle back lo his
home burg to try and raise the mazoom.
and then execute a gyration over the map
lookin’ for a good all-summer proposition
at some amusement park or other. - Salt
Harbor,’ says he, ‘ is a likely place.'

  “ Me and Eb, meantime, is to keep on
with the show, workin' south on credit.
Biz don’t bid fair to be s<5 good a* up
among the turkey-necked plow-pushers.
because, of course, the people is more
huir*n the.farther away you get and the
better run they’ll want for their money.
But still, we reckons some way we can
pull along till Hermann finds a chance
for us to recoop.

  “ Well, Hermann he takes nine dol-
lars and moseys out, leavin' us with only
thirty dollars and sixty cents in coin to
grease the Wheels of Destiny. It takes
more'n that when (here’s el even people
and six animals and a mummy and
freight and car-fare and advertLsin'. So
the Wheels squeaked. This whole story
is just the echo of that there t squeak.
Which it made the band-wagon of our
lives considerable noisy for quite a while.

II.

  " Peg Wilkins, our advance agent,
couldn't walk on the railroad track no
way in this world, what with slumpin’
into the cinders and jarrin’ on the ties
with that mahogany leg" of his. So we
had to ship him along southward to the
next town with the Noah’s Ark bunch.
Freight and ticket evaps twelve plunks
and leaves us only fourteen, after de-
ductin’ two-sixty for meat to feed the
critters. It’s about 8 p.m. on the
30th of June, and a Thursday, when
the tail-lights of Peg’s train fades from
our view, leavin’ us to economize by
plain every-day foot-work.

  “ We pounds cinders and spruce pretty
much all night, and next mornin’ dopes
into a wart on the map called Gilead. We
blows a couple of dollars against some
human fodder, which brings us down to
twelve simoleons and puts us very low
in our minds. Which we’re lower short-
ly after trvin’ to arrange for a show,
there bein’ a town regulation, due to
some local Women’s Anti-Everything
League, which prohibits tent exhibitions.
Therefore, it's hire a hall or hike. So
me and Eb leaves our troupe reposin’
round the freight-house and snipes our-
selves over the burg in a hurry.

  “ Well, Mister Man, that must have
been an off-day for luck in Gilead. The
balm-market was sure dry. Not a place
could we locate that wasn’t occupied.
The Grange had a meetin’ on their date-
book ;. there was a fair runnin’; and the
Opera House was full of hay.

  “ We fine-tooth-combed the settlement
fore an’ aft. and at last by bull-luck
run to earth a individual who's said to
know somethin’ about some place that’s
said to possibly be for hire. This indi-
vidual’s name is Walker Callington
Phipps, and he has a head on him like a
long mackrimay-lacework of glowing
whiskers glued to an ostrich-egg. The
egg being lumpy, you understand. Be-
sides, he’s lean, with a burking Adam's
apple.

  ••‘Hall?' says he, when we grapples
him. ‘ Hall? F’r a circus? Nawp.’

  “ • Why not? ’ falters Eb. with a qua-
king diaphragm
“ * It's our Lodge Hall. Ain't ben let
f'r a show' sence two years ago last
Jan-u-wary.’

  “ ‘ WJiich the reason is? ' says 1.
“‘Niggers. They had it. F'r min-
strels and the like o’ that. Took us three
days to clean up. Now we ain't friend-
ly to no such doin’s.’

  “ ‘ See here, mister,’ says 1, catchin’
him by the front part of his clothes.

' We’re on the narrow edge of the soup-
kettle, ami it all rests with you people
which way we tumble—see? Our whole
bunch, animals and humans, has only
twelve dollars between us and the sher-
iff. If we’s stranded here, Gilead's got
to care for us. and you're a taxpayer—
see? ’

  “ Walker Gallington polished off his
ivory-colored coco with his handkerchief,
swallowed hard, and then said, said he:
“ ‘ If you won’t take your critters in
the hall, and promise to be careful of
the furnishin’s, and also give us eight
dollars plus half the gate-money, I reck-
on you kin show here.’

  “ At that Eb and me orates some
plenty, but W. G. is harder than a'' coun-
try-hotel bed. and our eloquence can’t
dent him. He takes refuge in behind
his hirsute drop-curtain and refuses to
budge.

  “ ‘ What's more,’ says he, ‘ I can’t al-
low no regular charge to be made, this
bein' our Lodge Hall; but folks can
contribute whatever they sees fit. Other-
wise the deal’s all off.’

  “ Fresh bunches of consternation on
our part—more rapid-fire expostulation,
all wasted. It’s a case of take it or
leave it, and no more to be said, so we
takes it; but we’re sad, sad. and so’s all
the rest when we breaks the news to ’em.
But the try of our lives has to be made,
sadness or no sadness, so we prepares to
give Gilead the broadest-gaged fusillade
of folly we’s capable of furnishin’.

  “ We attracts quite some attention
teamin’ our stuff down to the hall, and
the street's full by the time our cages
is displayed in the entryway. You never
see such a bunch of Jaspers as buzzed
out to observe- us—regulation Yahoos.

quart tin pail. He nods to me and I
nods back. ‘ I'll gather the harvest f’r
you,’ says he to me. ‘ Let ’em in.' With
that I uncorks the best line of pill-prat-

battled farmers:

Love can sing herself into bronchial

   “ And he vibrates a spavined fin at us.
His words ended harsh, but still, con-
siderin' what he'd done for us. better

   “ After he'd gone, Eb and the Duck

in’ signs of dryness, and expounds some
desperation plans to him.

shoulder—‘ Peg. things is all to the ex-
tremely worse, and it’s now we put our
last sumarchee against a final shake of
the dice. Either we gets away from herp

which is Bethel, or we goes broke right
here and takes the count. Here’s all
the coin we've got. except two plunks.
Take it. There’s a train out of here,
south-bound, at twelve-two. Take that,
too.

   “1 Y'ou and your litho's make one
quick exit, and bill us the limit in

mals will follow some way. One good
haul and we’ll sand the rail again ; a fail-

contemplation. Hump, now! And as
you hope for salvation, no rum.’

“ ‘ My trunk.’ whimpers Peg. ‘ with
all m’ worldly goods—two wigs, a shirt,
and some burnt cork—if you go bust
will you send it back to old Hoboken?’
“ 1 Sure thing. Skip, now.’

   “ We steers him out past the cages
and into the street, and he weeps a few
as he receives our blessin'. Then he

   fades into the night with his posters and
our cash, headin’ for the deepo.

   “ Not very long after that, in spite of
 there bein’ such a hollowness in the place
 where we used to remember we had
 stomachs, and notwithstanding the un-
 certain outlook for the future, we folds
 ourselves up here and there on the stage
 and prepares for slumber. None of us
 has sand enough left to wash off the
 grease-paint and burnt cork; we just
 lavs right down as we are. black-face and

   '■ Eb, he blows out the lights; I tucks
 my blank-cartridge animal-trainin’ pistol
 under my canvas-scenery pillow and
 composes my mind to rest. About the
 last thing I remembers hearin' is a faint,
 far-away ' Hoot-Toot-Toot' ’ which I
 knows is the train for Bethel, and on
 that train is Peg-leg. bearin' away all our
 prospecks, worldly hopes, and the most
 of our cash.

 ahead to help us. To-morrow some-
 thin' will turn up. sure.’ Then 1 listens
 to the beUr coughin'; it gets farther an'
 farther away, the cough does, and a kind
 . of warm rosy hope nestles down among
 the icebergs of our luck, till at last I
 drifts away into the arms of Murphy's.

 we’s all pounding our ear luxurious,
 holding a sure-pop symphonic snore-fest.
 when there’s a ' Knock-tap-thumpetv-
 bump:' at the door, mingled up with
 the barkin’ of colonel (colonel was the
 Angelo Frercs’s little fox-terrier) and
 complicated with sounds as of a human
 voice. All of which jars me back to a
 lame, chilly, hungry kind of flabbergasted
 consciousness.

   " 1 sits up sudden in the dark and
 reaches for my pistol; it's harmless as a
 nursing-bot. but kind of good to bluff
 with. A prod in the laths from me starts
 Eb up, all frowsly.

    " ' \\ hat's that? ’ he whispers in a kind
 of a scared tell-me-quick-or-I’ll-holler
 voice that sets my scalp-lock to elevatin'.

   “ ' Sheriff, maybe! ’ I answers. ‘ Maybe
 tar-an’-feathers! Hear that?'

      There comes a rattlin. then the voice
 again, and somethin’ paws at the door:
 then the bear coughs and the rattle comes
 again.

   “ ‘ Tryin' to unlock it! ’ exclaims El),
and jumps up half dazed. He starts for
the door; and you remember j^'s in a
strange place, darker’n PharaoSp pocket
durin’ the tenth plague. Wen, result
is that Eb does a sevcn-league-boot stride
off the edge of the platform, which it’s
over a yard high. On the way down he
takes a footlight with him, and there's a
frappe of glass, oil, and Eb on the car-
pet immediate.

  “‘Hurt?’ says I, climbin’ down very
cautious.

  “ ‘ Murdered! ’ he bellows. ‘ Strike
a match! I’m dyin’!’

  “ As the light flares the others rouse
up, and there’s a cloudburst of questions.
By the time I gets a lamp lit and has
Eb on his feet again, what with him
limpin’ round and the others a mixture
of negligee and commiseration, we makes
a study for a poet’s dream.

  “ The smashed lamp and oily carpet
nearly distracts our minds from the
original cause of the whole to-do, yet
all this time there’s a rattlin’ at the door,
a tappin’, and that peculiar voice, seem-
in’ly eloquent over and above most
voices.

  “ ‘ Come on. now, boys, and see what’s
doin’ ’ ’ says I when Eb gets pulled to-
gether a bit. 1 I'll open the door, seein’
as I've got the pistol. But you all back
me up. and don’t let ’em rush us! ’

   “ By this time we’s at the door, me in
front with the artillery. Duck right be-
hind me with the lamp, and the rest
back of him.

   “ ‘ Look out, now,’ says I, as I snaps
back the catch and pokes the little blank
revolver through the crack.

  “ 1 Who—w-w-who’s there? ’ says I,
expectin’ a rush of some sort; but nary
rush comes. There’s not even anybody
standin’ outside; and what to make of
it I’m stumped if I know.’

  *" ‘ Hold that light here! ’ says I,
and the Duck obeys. Then the faint halo
of a jag wafts in round the edge of the
door. I peeks out, and there’s some-
thin’ human lyin’ on the porch, talkin'
to itself. The raw truth catches me.

   “ ‘ Peg-leg! ’

  “‘What?’ echoes my petrified min-
ions. ‘ Peg-leg? ’

   “ ‘ Him! ’ says I, and throws the door
wide open.	4

   “ Lifeless (almost) but beautiful he lay,
and no boiled owl was ever boilder than
him: he was smilin’, smilin' with his eyes
shut, and prattliiv like an innocent child,
which the prattle and the wooden leg
tappin’ the floor, and the large equator
of him and the smile-you-couldn't-file-off
make a tablow vivong of rare beautv,
more especial as he’s swimmin'-like with
his hands and flopping*; head from one
side to the other. \

  “ ‘ Fren’sh, kind, good fren'sh,’ says
he, ' couldn’t ’bandon kind, lovin m'nag-
erie—left m' trunk—all m’ worldly
goods—ain’t hon’rable ’bandon compan-
ions in trouble—hon'rable trunk—kind

an’ lovin’-’

  “ He looked like somethin’ the cat
brought in; and us in our play-actin'
costooms, with the grease-paint makin'
us blush outside of our sickenin’ misery
under the smoky light of one lamp—the
picture it made was a jeezly frost, now
you can bet on that and carry money
home.

  “ ‘ Come, fellers, in with him,’ says I.
at last, and we drags him inside, where
he passes away and begin to go prr-ouff
in full chromatics, with oblongato varia-
tions. Then we hold another mask-
ball-effeck council of war. What our
emotions was I won't try to tell you,
’cause the words ain't made yet to fit 'em.

  “ First thing we done after Reason
assumed her swav over Despair was
search the cuss, hopin’ against hope lie’s
still got some change left after his
merry-go-round of the speak-easies.

  " Sixty-eight cents is now all that's
left, plus a yeller pawn-ticket, plus some
pretzel-crumbs.

  “ ‘ This.’ says the Leeds Duck judi-
cial, when the census is complete. ' looks
like the most complicated game 1 ever
stacked into. We’d better explode this
show right here and now—open the ani-
mal-cages—each of us run a different
way, critters and all. They can t catch
more than a part of us, anyhow.'

  “ 1 It certainly does look like starva-
tion. sheriffs, and a shirt-tail scoot over
the map for ours.’ says I, * one jump
ahead of annihilation. Them that^ wants
to quit can quit now: who goes ? ’

  “ Everybody looks at everybody else,
but no one starts.	. ,

  •“Well, now,’ says T, ‘if we's goin
to hang together, my say is that the
quicker we mosey out of here the better
it’ll be. I ain’t hankerin’ none to meet
\V. G. in I lie mornin' when he sees the
damage and hears of the doin’s in this
Lodge Hall. This here situation is a
camel, and Peg's the final bunch of
straw. Exit left, for ours. How much
money in the gang?'

  “ Everybody digs up with both flip-
pers, and we manages to corral three-
twelve plus the meal ticket, the gold-
filled tooth, and the lead quarter.

  “‘Hand it all over I’ I commands,
and takes possession of the wealth in
the name of the common good.

  “‘Now, then.’ says 1. ‘the only lay
1 see is to hike out rapid somewheres
into the country, take up some land that’s
idle, and use it till we hears from Her-
mann. The farmer's life, they say, is
the only reely independent one on earth.’
‘“Me for it!' says Kid Nagle, en-
thusiastic. He’d been brought up in a
gutter and believed potatoes grew on
trees.

     But the animals?' objected Jeffer-
son P. Figg. ‘ What we goin’ to do with
a bear, or aniliu cats, or a link, out
farmin’? Can you hypnotize ’em into
subsistin’ on spruce-boughs ? ’

  “ ‘ I read once of a man crossin' the
Sahara,’ answers 1, ‘ which he has a
little dog with him, and they runs out
of grub. Well, this here man cuts the
dog's tail off and makes soup of it—
see?—and gives the bone to the dog,
and they’s both happy and pulls through.
What man has done man can do. so don’t
you worry none.’

  “ ‘ But Miltiades is a cinnamon bear,
and cinnamon bears ain’t got no tails.’
“‘Aw, reverse for yours,’ says I.
1 You're a skeptic, and life’s too short
to waste arguin’ with them what has no
imagination.’

IV,

  “ Resultin' from the conference of
war, I sends the Angelo McCarty Freres
out in the gray of early mornin', one
to the railroad deepo to see if there’s
any telegram yet from Hermann, while
the other one rustles up a livery-stable
and orders a big barge with two horses.
The rest of us washes up and packs our
stuff preparatory to migratin’.

  “ About the time I-'rancesco de Mike
Angelo returns with no news from the
deepo, his brother Vincento Pat drives
up with the barge, sittin’ on the front
seat along of the driver, which is a big
red-mottled-faced gazebe, inclined to lie
graspin’ as to coin.

  “ I dickers with this individual and
arranges for three dollars’ worth of
transportation. In consideration of the
dough lie's to take us way out into the
country and dump us in some likely place
and say nothin’. I s humans and the
dog and the bear is to go; the rest of
the animals we leaves on the front steps
of the hall, with a sign on one of the
cages like this:

Left for Benefit of Kind Creditors.

Wc Can’t Keep 'Em, so we Leave ’Em.
Feed 'Em Right and they’ll Love You-

  “ This arranged, we stows our baggage
on top of the barge, puts old Miltiades
in his cage crossways ol the vehicle in
front, lays Peg-leg in the straw, and piles
in. The driver cracks his whip, one or
two fossilized citizens yawps at us, the
horses stagger, the old barge creaks, wob-
bles, and makes a heave forward, and
we’re off!

  “ Few seen and none mourned our
departure from that hospitable burg.
Two or three times Eb and me tries
to get the driver started on some nice-
weather-we’re-havin’ talk, but he lias a
bad case of the fishy eye and answers
with nothin' but an ice-w-agon line of
grunts, so we lets our gab-policies lapse.

  “After that we drives in silence
(broken only by old Miltiades’s grumb-
lin’ and Peg’s gradual wakin' up), verv
low in our minds, and all to the bad
as to interior furnishin’. We ain’t had
a four-cornered feed in twenty-four
hours, and you ran’r live on bananas and
crackers and wear turned collars and feel
human, that’s a fact. We gets out of
town pretty soon, into the real Yap Dis-
tricts. where every farmhouse shells out
gawpin’ Reubes in the damp cold dawn.

  “ Well, we jolts and sags along the
rutty road for half an hour or more,
till at last we comes to a kind of
wooded point juttin' out into a lake—
BURDOCKS AND BLUEBERRIES.

741

Spot Pond, the driver says it is. We
takes a vote, and it’s Spot Pond for
ours. So we stops and unloads ourselves,
trunks, tents, and Miltiades.

  “ Gettin’ the baggage down from on
top of the barge Kid Nagle unfortu-
nately puts a little of his weight on the
side-bars and one of ’em buckles up, so
the top slumps over and spills Peg-leg’s
trunk, which sort of explodes the shirt
and wigs and burnt cork into the ditch.
That sobers Peg in a minute; what be-
tween the shock of his loss and the vi’lent
efforts to rescue his property, he plumb
gets over his alcoholics.

  “ As for the driver, when he sees his
barge cave in he grows vicious, but we
quells him and sends him oS home,
wavin’ his ham of a list; and the lan-
guage that floats back to us is some cay-
enne, or I ain’t no judge of embroidered
speechifvin’.

  “ It’s maybe five hundred yards from
the road to the far side of the wooded
point, and by the time we totes our
stuff and the "bear-cage in there (leadin’
Miltiades by his nose-ring) the polish
is pretty well off our shaftin'. We're
glad to strike such a haven of peace, you
bet! The woods is on two sides of us:
to the left is a marshy place, and dead
ahead is the lake. Where we decides
to camp, there's a clean beach. Take
it all round, it’s a boss and dandy loca-
tion.

  “ First thing we does after we gets
the tents set up and washes in the lake
is to have a try for some fish. A few
pins and alder poles, and some twine
does for tackle; and there’s plenty worms
round the swamp. Not a quarter-hour
from the time we’re settled you c’d ’a’
seen us stragglin’ round the lake shore,
Peg and all, though Peg he sinks in the
beach pretty bad, his mahogany leg bein’
smallish and round at the end.

  “ I finds him a good place on a log
that sticks out of the water—a good
likely lookin’ place, with a muddy bot-
tom, where pouts is apt to come.

  “1 Go in and win,' I tells him, and
then walks along, castin’ here and there,
but not even gettin’ so much as a sucker
on my hook—and me a circus man, too!

  “ Well, I ain’t gone but a hundred
feet, or mebbe two, when there's a gi-
gantic ktrjlop! and a sort of yell cut in

two in the middle, and then a bubbly
noise.

  "‘What—th—deuce?’ thinks I, and
starts back on the run.

  “ Say, d’ you know, when I gets in
sight of the log there ain't no Peg on
it; but there's a kind of egg-beater ef-
feck in the water, with rile and mud
and bubbles all sousled up together.
Peg's fish-pole, too, is floatin’, and his
hat; and there's somethin’ el<e—kind
of a stick with a knob on it that’s frothin'
the water convulsive, like a churn-stick.

 “‘What—the-’ I begins again;

but all of a sudden a human boot pro-
jects out of the water, near the stick,
and there's a leg in the boot—Peg’s good
leg! The leg and the stick pirouettes
foamily a minute and then starts to go
down; but I skips out along the log,
grabs the stick, and hauls in.

  “ Peg he comes up blowin’ like the
father of all bellowses, drippin' ooze and
mud.

  “ ‘ I s-s-slipped on some tarn-n-nation
moss! ’ he splutters, ‘ and my 1-1-leg
floated and my head s-s-stayed down
and I'd 'a’ been drowned in ’bout a
m-m-minute if you hadn't got me!
Pf-f-fui! IVIwosh! You told me to
g-g-go in and win. and I did! Look! ’

  “ And he holds up the two-pound
mud-pout that had pulled him off’n the
slippery log. It’s sure a strangle hold
he's got on the pout as I helps him back
along the log.

  “ By the time Peg's cleaned up and
dressed in some gladiator togs of mine
(they bein' the only spare things we've
got with a big enough equator—stretchy
cloth) the others straggle in with more
or less fish and we lights a fire. Chow-
der's suggested; and what with a few
hunks of dog-biscuit stolen plumb out-
right from Colonel and our catch, we
makes up a good hot kettle of grub.

  “ Which after the tin plates is licked
clean by Colonel and Miltiades, and we
gets our pipes goin' round the fire, we
votes it ain’t so tarnation bad even it we
are cross-hobbled by Fate and turned
loose on a beach to scrabble up a livin
by unusual and irregular means, like a
bunch of cats tryin’ to catch mice in a
sleepin’-car.

  “ Smokin’, we argues what to do with
Miltiades. We can’t feed him. and we
can’t let him starve. Eb suggests tryin’

•	my Sahara methods on him. one paw at a
time; Kid Nagle says to kill and eat
him: while J. 1’. Figg wants to make
him hibernate. The rest says to let him
go. and as we’s in the majority, go he
has lo. But he ain’t at all eager for free-
dom : quite the contrary.

   " It's only when we threatens to poke
him with a hot iron trapeze-bar that he’ll
get up at all and climb down outa his
cage. He won’t leave the camp even
then, but hangs round, sniffin' at the
dishes, till we plumb has to drive him
off. Finally, seein’ as how we ain't goin’
to he his meal-ticket no longer, he boos
and snuffles and crashes off through the
woods, more sad than mad, yet makin’
little side-swipes at the bushes, too. for
to show he ain’t an angel, hut just a
plain, every-day. human kind of a bear,
after all.

  “ ‘ By-bv,’ says the Duck when the
last of him (and he's very hob-ended
at that) disappears in the undergrowth;
and then we clots round the fire again
to talk things over and hatch plans—
plans bein’ like eggs, which they hatch-
es out best in a warm place.

   " The plans end in a blueberry cru-
sade. Blueberries, yes—acres of ’em all
along the edges of the woods—big, juicy
fellers, just the custard for the Agglom-
erated Tent Shows. We all goes at ’em
that afternoon; takes tin dishes and goes
to peckin' at the bushes like a bunch of
hens punishin' hot mash.

   “ It ain’t too bad. neither, what with
the blue sky an’ the white-cappy lake,
the bumblybees workin' overtime for the
lloney Trust, and maybe a big steely
blue devil's darning-needle skyhootin’
past with a Santos Dumont flicker of
wings. Two or three of us shucks foot-
leather and does the K-nipe-cure act.

   “ And you’d a envied us our appetites
that evenin' when we comes in with thir-
ty quarts of blueberries and gathers
round the fire to eat a supper of more
chowder and them same berries, with
two quarts of milk that we borrowed
from a farmer’s cow over in a pasture
beyond the swamp.

    And after supper we smokes again,
and rags away at this. that, and the
other thing, mostly speoulatin’ as to
how Hermann’s makin' it and when he'll

get on track of us again. Pretty soon
the little new moon comes up over the
woods like a muskmelon rind over a
back fence, and then we gets out a couple
of banjos and does stunts of war&1 in',
while Eb and the Duck accompanies on
the African harp.

  “ I’ve seen worse times in the show biz.
you can bet your hand to the plasterin'
on //rtf/.'

V.

  Aboui a.m. that night there busts
in on us a rumpus that’s a blend
of growls, squeals, barks, and just plain
noise, like a menagerie turned loose in a
slaughter-house. We comes to in a
hurry, all buzzin' questions, and I grips
my revolver like a miser boldin’ on to
a goldfish. Seems like the noise is sort
of bearish; we sees somethin’ lumberin'
toward the cage, with Colonel orbitin'
round, uncommon eloquent.

  “‘Shoat!’ hollers Kid Nagle, of a
sudden; and ' Save it! ’ echoes the Duck.

  “ In about one second there’s a mix-up,
the Agglomerated Tent Shows versus
Miltiades, with one young pig as first
prize.

  " ’Twas epic while it lasted, but we
gets the pig eventual, though kind of tat-
tered. A shame to do it—to rob the old
boy when he’s been retrievin'—but fact
is, we needed the meat, and ain’t that kind
of excuse good for any sort of graft? By
firelight we dresses the critter ; Milt, he
comes in (like a sure-enough proletariat)
for what's left over.

  “ And about half-past ten next morn-
ing. after havin’ breakfasted in epicure-
an style on berries and shoat, you could 'a'
seen Eb and J. P. and me hikin’ to town
with tin pails full of the fruit. Our idea
was to sell 'em and lay in supplies, swap
’em for things, and also redeem the meal-
ticket we'd got in the contribution for
whatever it would fetch. We must have
had twenty or twenty-five quarts, and
we’s calculatin’ what a bunch of edibles
they'll swap for. to say nothin' of cash.

  " But our frenzied finance strikes a
rock and busts wide open like a jellyfish
hit by a baseball bat. just subsequent to
our first try at the market.

also she has one of them wans, the kind
you always want to grab and yank off.

  “ She only stares, so again says I:
' Blueberries ? ’

  “ ‘ Land sakes, no!' she answers.
‘ You're handlin’ the wrong article.’
Then she laughs, and her double chin
suddenly adopts another roll of fat off
her neck, so she’s got three chins.

  “ * I snum.’ says she, ‘ blueberries is
the hardest thing to sell that there is.
round here. Why. they even grows in
people’s back yards. This is preservin’-
time, and I reckon everybody's supplied.
You'd better try another line, such as
apple-trees, or needles, or rat-pizen.'

  “ Then she shut the door.

  “ Take my oath, we never sold more
than two quarts that whole mornin’. but
we collected quite a lot of grub by bar-
ter, especially from the Empire Spa.
where J. P. Figg exchanged the meal-
ticket for a big sackful of dry bread,
all kinds.

  “ When we got back to camp and
joined dividends we found a blueberry
pie. some johnny-cake with blueberries
in it, and a jar of fresh blueberry pre-
serve. Seems like we wasnj cut out to
forget the taste of blueberries, anyway.
So we'has dinner—pig garnished with
berries—and renders thanks that we’s
still alive.

  “ That afternoon it sets in to rain a
little, so we huddles into the tents and
chews the rag. Miltiades lingers round:
we can hear him. off and on, cracklin' the
bushes. ’Long toward evenin’ the rain
lets up and we goes out prospectin’ dnce
more. This time Eb and me runs onto
a potato-field t’other side of the woods,
without any visible owner except the
bugs, which is disportin' of themselves
scandal ious.

  “ ‘ Potatoes! ’ says I. ‘ And why not? ’
says Ed. and then we goes at 'em.

  “ If it comes right down to starva-
tion or coppin’ grub, most of us will
cop. any day. We takes care to pull the
tubers out the side of the hills, so's not
to disturb the plants any, and we puts
the dirt back careful. In ten minutes
we’s hikin' back to camp, every pocket
crammed. And better potatoes I never
squdged tooth into—big white fellers,
hot and mealy.

  “ But the reckonin', next day. wasn't
so pleasant. Eb, you see. had left one
hill open by mistake, and die fanner
happened along with some bug-powder
and seen it; and it was all off with us
immediate.

  “ This here farmer was a Swede or
Finn or somethin’, about six feet six in
his socks (only he didn’t wear socks). and
weathered-lookin', same as tanbark. He
blows into camp while we're all awav
bertyin’, all except the Hibernian An-
gelo Freres, who’s peelin' potatoes for
dinner. When he sees ’em he lands a
kick on Colonel that near petrifies him,
and doubles up his hands and orates.

  "' Har bane my potato?’ says he.
' My potato, and y'u bane t'iefs and Ay
pu y'u in lockup, and y'u haf big dog
steal my y'ung pig! ’

  “1 See the boss.' answers Mike An-
gelo. ‘ 1 can't sprecken zee Dutch.’

  “ ‘ Dutch? Y u call me Dutch, and
y'u t'ief my pig and potato? Ay get
de law on y'u 1 ’

  “ Then he cuffs Mike and cusses Yin-
cento Pat de Angelo, and makes a quick
exit. When he's gone the k:J hollers
for us, and we comes lopin' in to see
what's up. Pretty soon it sounds like a
crow-congress discussin’ the tariff on
com in a tamarack. As a result of our
deliberations we buries the hog-bones
and potato-peelins’ in a good, safe place
where they won't never be found, and
Eb and me pikes for town, hotfoot on
the trail of Svensky Finn, to lock horns
with the police force of Gilead.

  “ We finds the force hoein’ his gar-
den, just havin’ given the Finn party a
warrant for our arrest. It’s somethin'
of a supprise to him when he sees us,
and it's more of a supprise when I comes
out plump with a demand for a warrant
on my own hook against said Scandi-
navian. It seems that W. G. Phipps is
buzzin' on our trail, too. for damages to
his Lodge Hall, so our stock is some
depreciated with the police.

  “ ‘ Why.’ says he, ' my duty is t' ar-
rest both of you this very minute and
lock ye up. to say nothin' of givin' you

  “ ‘ Plus the action that will be brought
by the real owner of the show for de-

  “ ‘ Hold on! Wait!' says the police
force. ‘ Gilead ain’t wantin’ to git tan-
gled in no spider-web of litigation.
Wait here and I'll fix you up a paper,
so's mebbe you can settle out of court

  " And off he spraddles into the house.
Bout five minutes later he comes out
again, with a folded document.

  " * Here.’ says he. ' You see your man,
now. and square things with him.
This'll help. And you clear out of the
town limits inside of twenty-four hours—
see? Way out! If you don’t, you'll hear
from me pussonal.’

  “‘Thanks,’ says I. ‘We will.' But
which it was we meant we left him to
guess.

  " Then we hipered back to camp, only
stoppin' to exchange a nickel which we
found lay in' loose in the linin’ of my
coat for a big bunch of stale bread, that
bein’ cheaper than fresh, and filling-er.

  “ W hex we arrives at the lake we finds
there's trouble in the shape of a country
constable with Svensky Finn’s warrant,
and Finn, he’s there, too. The group -

guments that was takin- place when we
heaved iu sight, was sure full of action.
Seems like Finn - case ain’t makm' much
headway, ’cause there ain’t no evidence,
not a skrid of it anywheres, except his

say-so, which ain't no 1 tetter than ours.
Bui soon’s we arrives we puts that to
rights immediate.

   ■'•Sure.' says I, 'we took the goods;

 hungry we ate it. Serve your warrant.'

 you’re servin’ it serve this, too, such bein'
 your duty! ’

 retires toward the woods for a confer-
 ence. Off to the left 1 hears a cracklin'.

 And while we's standin' there very nerv-
 ous to know whether Finn’s goin’ to settle
 out of court or push matters a figure
 comes lopin’ ’cross-lots for us, the sun
 glints off a bunch of flamin' hirsuteness,
 and we all recognizes more trouble in
 the 'mediate future.

   “ W. G. Phipps, of course, and when
 he's near enough he hauls out a paper,
 too. and pokes it at me.

 say: it's a bill for damages to the hall—
 ten dollars altogether, what with the
 busted footlight, burnt carpet, and gen-
 eral disorder, to say nothin' of Peg’s fos-
 silSation. While I'm lookin' it over,
 with loud mental groans, back comes the
 sheriff and Finnsky.

  “ ‘ We accepts that apology,' says I,
and shakes hands with Finn.

  “ 1 Glad one case is settled.’ remarks
the sheriff, while Svenskv backs away,
still holdin' on to his Hands, so’s life
won't trip over 'em. ‘ There’s another,
though—this here bill of Mr, Phipps’s
—ten dollars. Will you settle and move
on, or shall we sue?’

  “‘You’re welcome to all I've got!’-
exclaims the Duck, ‘ though 1 tell you
right here if you take it I have to walk
away in a barrel.’

  “ ‘ Same here,’ says I. Then a sudden
hope busts in my think-tank.

  “ ‘ Do I understand,’ I asks, ‘ that if
this here bill is settled it'll square us
with Gilead and we gets the menagerie
back and are free to leave town. Is
such the meanin’ of the court?'

   “ ' It is,’ says the sheriff.

  “ ‘ What's a big cinnamon bear worth
to you ? ’ I asks, ‘ bears bein' on a risin'
market and shop-worn ones bringin’ one
hundred an’ fifty or over?’

  “ There’s a gleam of yellow in the
sheriff’s eye as he answers:

  “1 Thirty dollars, said bear warranted
sound and kind.'

  “ ‘ Make it fifty and our darlin' Mil-
tiades is lost to us forever.’

   “ ‘ Forty.'

  “ ‘ Done,’ says I. ' Gimme the thirty
dollars change and lie’s yours.’

  “‘Hold on!’ says he. ‘Hold on!
Where’s the bear?'

  “ ‘ Oh. off there in the woods. Hear
him cough? Take him; lie's yours.’

  “ I waved my hand eloquent.

  “ ‘ But—but you got to deliver the
goods, ain’t you? ’

  “ ‘ That's right; come along, boys.'
says I to my henchmen. ‘ Come an’
we’ll round up Milt.’

  “ Was it some dust blew into my eye,
or just a plain every-day wink?

  “ ‘ Spread out,' says I, 1 and circle
round tack of him. And you three,' I
continues to the Gileadites. ‘ stay here
by the edge of the woods and head him
off when he runs out. He ain’t been fed
in some time, and his temper’s all to the
bad till he gets some inward baggage,
but the minute you lay hands on him
lie’s yours—see?’

  “ ‘ But—but-’ protests the sheriff.

  “ ‘ That’s all right.' 1 reassures him.

‘ We ain't tryin’ to take no due honor
away from you; and remember, a bear's
nose is the tenderest place he’s got. One
good crack on the probosci puts the most
husky bruin in the D. and O. for quiU-
a while—not that you'll have occasion
for violence with old Milt, but simply
as a small crumb of useful information,
easy to swaller and not liable to set up
mental gripes—see? Let the expedition
advance.’

  “ About then the Agglomerateds be-
gins to proceed toward the bosky dells
where old Milt is -layin’, and every step
we takes the boys hesitates, peers round,
listens, and shows the earmarks of a
disposition to beat it over the top of the
scenery at the first grumble.

  “ All this ain't lost none on our guests
as we comes to the woods and plunges
in. Professional dignity and human
scaredness comes to close grips in the
sheriff’s heavin’ boozum; and from all
indications the p. d. is all to the worse.

  “ Finn, he ain’t much better off; he
says aTew remarks in shorthand or some-
thin’, and shows desires to constitute the
rear guard. As for Walker G., he just
picks up a good stick and says nothin'.
Such bein’ the different ways of nian:
which man is a curious beast, half mind,
three-quarters foolishness, and seven-
eighths animal, after all. when it comes
to a tight place.

  “ Well, we plunges in. as I've said,
leavin’ the three visitors on the outside
of the woods, and beats up round old
Milt with just the Hist!—there-he-is-
now! air, as if the poor old dyspeptic
cuss was a royal Ceylon man-eater.

  “ We finds him easy enough—he’s
layin’ down in a kind of dingle, where
he’s made himself a wallow. When he
sees us he whines friendly and nuzzles
his paws.

  “ ' Look out! Careful! ’ shouts El>.
1 He’s ripe for trouble.'

  “ ‘ Stand back, now, everybody,’ I
commands. ' Drive him out easy; don't
hurry him. Careful! ’

  “ Seems like there's remarks from tin-
three men outside in the clearin', but it's
too far to hear what they say. 'specially
as Kid Nagle then gives Milt a short-
rib poke with a club and Milt heaves t<>
his feet and grumbles off toward the edge
of the woods.

  “‘Head him off. there! Look out!
There he goes! Watch them claws!
Turn him ! Turn him! ’

  “ Such is the verbiage that floats out
to Phipps and the other two, who’s neat-
ly bunched to head off bruin. Ahead of
us old Milt plows along through the
underbrush, some vexed at our prods,
and also at Colonel’s barkin’ round his
heels.

  “ Then he comes to the edge of the
woods, and we sets up a Comanche yell,
rushes forward, and projects Milt in the
direction of our guests. Milt he breaks
into a lope; the day’s hot, and he’s pant-
in'. trap hangin’ out, long and drippy,
Colonel yaps himself almost into dog-
apoplexv.

  “ ‘ Head him • Turn him ! ’ I screech-
es, and the others all plays up to
me, full bellows-power, as we careens
out of the timber.

  “ The sheriff, when he sees this here
ursine panorama of wrath-to-come pi-
rootin' for him head on, turns a lettuce-
green, wobbles, makes noise, and Scrab-
bles rearward. Finnsky and W. G.
looks disposed to hit the high places,
too; but Phipps manages to get sand
on the rail, and Finn, he’s more afraid
of bein’ afraid than he is of Milt, so
he makes a stand, too.

  “ ' Head him off!' I yells again, and
dog my cats if W. G. don’t reely grip
his club and advance, with old Vike in
the rear. On comes Milt with a rush,
surrounded by Colonel; on comes the
pair of heroes. Now Milt’s within twen-
ty feet. Up goes the club. Milt sees it
and doubles; W. G. closes in.

  “ 1 Swish! Thud!' plumb on the
bowsprit.

  “ ‘ Boo-oo! ' Milt quivers from bilge
to keelson, rares up, and makes an open-
handed swipe at \V. G-, who turns just
in time to catch the claws in the part of
his pants he uses most when he’s sittin’
down.

   “ ‘ R-r-r-rip! ’

  “ ' Boo-oo! Swipe! ’ and W. G.’s club
flips thirty feet through the atmosphere.
W. G. goes down in a simoom of dust,
bear-claws, eloquence, and rags. As the
hero falls he makes a grab, and gets both
hands jiu-jitsued into Milt’s fur.

  “'Help! Help!’ comes a muffled
screech.

  “ Vike. he .ain’t so slow, after all—he
does a baseball slide and lands on Milt's
quarter-deck, likewise tanglin’ his talons
in the thatch.

  “ Now, when a bear’s s’prised he's
scairt, and when he’s scairt he runs, and
when he runs he proceeds some rapid.
And Milt was s’prised.

  " Wherefore W. G., what ain’t got
sense enough left by now to let go, rico-
chets, and Vike, he ricofhets, too, such
of the time as he finds his knobby legs
ain’t up to the job of such zippy trans-
portation.

  “ If you can figger out a fur-covered
comet snakin’ a couple of bouncin’ satel-
lites through space in a series of quick
jumps, the whole biz enveloped in a
whirl of yelpin’ dog-star, maybe you get
the idea, only you’ve got to add spatters
of gravel, guggle-guggles through
muddy places, rip-tearin’ through black-
berry-bushes. a sireen yammer from the
comet, and also hashed language from
the tangled and rearward-tloppin’ ker-
flummoxed satellines.

  “ Old Milt's that stampeded with
alarm he don’t think of nothin’ but his
cage; and a bee-line’s crooked as light-
nin’ beside his geometrical get-there.

  “Whish, puff! That's the camp-fire!

  “Blop! Biff! Good dive, that!

  “ Right into the cage, boys, and curl
up in the far corner, sore nose buried in
paws—and the satellites, where? Scraped
off, shaved clean off the comet—cage-
door's pretty narrow—see? and Milt’s
big—kind of a muddle of things on the
ground, half U. S., half Finn, but so
tangled that you can’t see your.Finnish
apart from the rest of it.

WITH THE REDS IN RUSSIA.

 By Alexander McArthur

 J-JEREIN American honor, de-
 ceived by Slavic slyness, is
 responsible for a catastrophe.

HAD just turned into the Nevsky,
and was enjoying that wondrous
scintillating night-scene of Rus-
sia's winter city, when a hair in
my throat made me put up my hand to
my mouth and cough thrice.

  It was a purely accidental and un-
premeditated occurrence, and I would
never have given the act a thought,
only that some two seconds later a tall
individual in a long fur cloak, the collar
well gathered about his chin, approached
me and said, in a mysterious whisper:

J

  “ Follow me.”

  Newspaper training bad made me
quick of thought and action, and even
as I asked myself “ What the dickens
is this?” I turned on my heel and fol-
lowed him.

  Matters in St. Petersburg were, for
the moment, somewhat slow; my col-
leagues and myself were forced to rely
on our imaginations and trust to luck to
pull us through. Our editors in New
York paid us for news and insisted on
getting it; but as a matter of fact, in
spite of rumors here, there, and every-
where, nothing was happening, or affair.-
were so secret that none of us could get
wind of them.

  At the same time, we all agreed that it
was but the lull before the storm. The
country was in the throes of a mighty
discontent, and the wildest rumors as to
what was coming were afloat.

  Something was bound to explode, we
told ourselves consolingly over our pipes
in the back room of the little cafe where,
not a stone’s throw from the Kazan
Cathedral, we gathered nightly.

  As I followed the mysterious stranger
1 felt satisfied I was at last hot on the
trail of this “ something.”

  How lucky 1 had coughed three times;
that, evidently, was the magic signal. I
could not help cogitating on the triviality
of incidents that so often make up the
grave and tragic facts of life.

  For months I had haunted the lowest
cafes and tea-houses of the Vasily Os-
troff. 1 had treated the students, lis-
tened to their raw debates, acquiesced in
statements steeped in pessimism, and
uttered sentiments—when I deemed it
safe and prudent—that would have
blown up the Czar’s empire had they
been bombs.

  But I could never get the confidence
of the Nihilists, nor ingratiate myself
into their sympathies. Others told me
my standing at the American embassy
always proved my stumbling-block.

  But at last here was something for
my perseverance, and instinct told me it
was Nihilism.

  We had reached the Church of St.
Catherine, on the Nevsky, and my leader
turned in. I followed. In the corridor
leading to the priests’ apartments he
turned and faced me.

   “ You are somewhat early,” he said.

   I nodded.

  " The meeting,” he began cautiously,
“ is not till one o’clock. You know
that?”

  Again I nodded.

  He seemed annoyed, then he said
quickly:

  " How are they all in Geneva?”

  This was a puzzler to me. Was it a
password or a question, I queried of my-
self nervously.

   I	looked him straight in the eye; then

I	said tartly:

  " My dear sir, I never talk. Silence
is always prudent.”

  For a moment he seemed taken aback,
even frightened, but after studying me
intently he laughed as one who enjoys
a huge joke.

   Straightening himself, he said soberly:

  " But this is not business. We must
make our plans. The meeting is not till
one o'clock, and it is now only eight, but
I dti not like to lose sight of you.”

   11	I'm jiggered if I lose sight of you,”
was my instant reflection.

  11	1 see you are in evening clothes.
Have you some engagement?”

   “ Yes; the ball at the Gagarines."

   “ Ah! ” he cried, as he threw open his
cloak, revealing his faultless attire, “ then
it is easy. I can wait for you in the
antechamber."

  “ Well, all right," I replied, like a
chump, falling into his snare.

  Nihilism or no Nihilism, I did not
want to miss the ball. The salon of the
Princess Gagarine was the most delight-
ful in St. Petersburg; the members of
the various embassies were sure to be
there—Prince Gagarine was Minister of
Instruction—and commend me to the
diplomatic corps for gossip. I always
carried away a quiverful, enough to give
me material for a dozen Sunday sheets.

  “ The name on your card is Banks, is
it not?” he next inquired.

  The name on my cards was John
Everett Carrington.

   “ Banks, yes,” I replied readily, won-
dering what I should say if he asked me
to produce one.

  He seemed relieved.

  So was I.

  “ But how does it come that you got
the invitation?” he asked eagerly.

  “ Oh,” I laughed mysteriously, “ that
is my affair.”

  “ Well,” he went on, buttoning up his
cloak, 11 suppose we go to the rooms' of
the society? I want to get some papers.”

  “ As you like,” I answered, as calmly
as I could. What a story, if I could only
once get there. Fate seemed too kind.

  We left the building, and taking the
first iswostschik without the formality of
bargaining, my companion gave him the
number of a house on the Nevsky
near by.

  “ Hardly necessary to take a sleigh,”
I interposed.

  “ Walking is always dangerous," was
the sententious response.

  We stopped before a house facing the
Anitchkoff Palace, the residence of the
Czar when in St. Petersburg.

  The dvornik allowed us to enter un-
challenged: we passed into a hall, but in-
stead of ascending, descending. We came
to a narrow passage, which 1 estimated
must be at least six or eight feet be-
neath the level of the street. All at once
my companion kicked three times-on the
wooden floor. A moment later the
boards moved back as if by magic. By
the light of the electric lamp my friend
carried I saw a long (light of steps, lead-
ing. apparently, into darkness.

  “Come on,” he said, seeing me peer
below'; “ they are steep, but I will go
ahead and count the number out to you.”

  I could hear a steady hammering and
pounding, and the lower we went the
more distinct this sound grew. There
mis the smell of earth—the clamp moldi-
ness that comes when it has not been
disturbed for years, if ever before.

  All at once it flashed across me. The
Nihilists were burrowing under the
Nevsky—it had been rumored they were
so doing—burrowing to reach the Czar's
palace. Reaching out to do what they
had so often bombastically threatened:

   “ Blow the palace and all the royalties
in it to Hades.”

  Something cold ran down my spine;

I felt myself grow pale. It is easy to
write and discuss and tell of things, but
when it comes to facing them, that is
another matter. 1 could feel myself
tremble.

  A charge of dynamite, and chaos!
The Czar's immediate family destroyed
at one blow!

  The scheme was colossal!

  1 thanked God. as I had done daily
since my arrival in Russia, that I was
not the Czar, nor of his entourage.

  We reached the end of the stairs,
traversed a long passage, and entered a
vast damp chamber, with lanterns strung
from a beam above. A suave-voiced
person came to greet us.

  “ Ah, Officer B.." lie said, extending
his hand.

  My cicerone whispered something in
his ear. whereupon he held out his hand
to me.

  1 grasped it: my teeth were chatter-
ing with cold.

  A little beyond, men were working
with lanterns fastened to their caps—
working with pickax and shovel. Some-

how. tbe place reminded me of a mine.
It had all the dreariness and ugliness.
The smell of the earth they were dig-
ging and of the wood they were using
seemed the most penetrating odor that
had ever greeted my nostrils.

  Officer B. took a small square pack-
age from a desk. He put this in the
lining of his cloak; then he embraced
his friend as one who goes on a long
journey—that is, lingeringly and ten-
derly. Tears were in the eyes of both,
tears in the tones of their voices.

  1 was wondering why, when Officer B.
said, turning to me :

  “ We had better go, now.”

  Again he led the way; again I fol-
lowed him. At the head of the stairs
he pressed a spring, we emerged, reached
the Nevsky, and stood on the sidewalk
waiting for a sleigh.

  My brain was in a whirl; only one
thought was uppermost—how could I
best manage to get to a cable office?

  Get to it I was determined. I had
a story that would startle New York
and every city in Europe and America
on the morrow. Before the police of
St. Petersburg were awake the news
would be flashed to every point of civ-
ilization on the globe. Not for an hour
would I delay my triumph. I would
certainly sacrifice anything to come.

  When Officer P.. told the is-.vostschik
to drive to Prince Gagarine’s I halted
him and said, as quietly as I could:

  “ No, let us go to the American Cafe,
behind the Kazan Cathedral; we won't
meet any one there at this hour, and if
we get to the palace by ten o’clock it
will be time enough."

  My companion did not seem pleased,
but he assented, and on our way down I
asked him what he thought of certain of
our American stocks.

  He replied in a tone of indifference
that he knew nothing about stocks.

  I tried to interest him. and mean-
while laid my plan.

  Arriving at the restaurant. I pro-
fessed hunger and ordered a rabchik,
against which 110 Russian appetite is
proof ; this, with a salad, was soon put
on the table, and the waiter brought me
tbe evening papers.

  All at once, after glancing hurriedly
over these, I said quickly:
750

THE ALL-STORY MAGAZINE.

  “ My friend, you must pardon me for
a few minutes: I must write cut a long
cable to my stock.-brek.er. Those stocks
1 -poke to yoa about, you know.”

  “ Oh. yoa Americans.” he said jooam-
fully: " can you think of nothing but
money ? ”

  I waved my hand at him jubilantly. I
knew I could get my story off.

  Ten minutes later my •-‘able was writ-
ten. Officer B. read it. as I could see
from across the table: but it was a mean-
ingless jumble of words tc all except
two or three in th:- office to which I was
sending it.

  We finished our rai-.-Aii and salad; I
paid the score, walked across to the tele-
graph office, sent off my cable, and en-
tered the sleigh, my spirits rejoicing.

  With Nihilism I had never any sym-
pathy. I needed it in my business, I
made use of it and money out of it when-
ever 1 cv-uld. but I loathed it as I loathed
all bloodshed.

  Sitting beside Officer B.. I chuckled
over my luck in being able to fed. one
of the most inhuman plots of which I
had ever read or heard. I thought of
the lives in that great palace—the kindly
a ad gra-.ious Czaritsa. the innocent little
grand take and grand duchesses playing
in their nursery. I thought of what
might have happened but for that cough
of mine, and I shuddered so that Officer
E. asked me if I was still cold.

  We were at the palace before I knew

it.

  A crowd of sleighs hemmed us in;
all around us soldiers and police were
shouting out hoarse orders to the long-
suffering ifseesisekik.

  Officer B. said hastily: “Now. you
get the information you came for. and
leave me to lock after myself; I will be
in the antechamber, as arranged.”

  We entered, and in the throng of peo-
ple Officer B. slipped away. ! got rid
of my cloak, and after paying my re-
spect- to the hostess, the beautiful Prin-
cess Gagarine. I moved away to see who
had come and who of my old friends
were there.

  As I was going from one room w an-
other Marie Wakwska touched me
sharply on the shoulder with her fan.

  “ Ivan Petrowitch." she whispered im-
peratively. beckoning me with fnsr head.

  That was how they addressed me in
Russia. “ John the son of Peter."

  My heart began pounding. Mane was
adorable—the most beautiful girl in St.
Petersburg: a poetess, an essayist, and
the special correspondent of a Warsaw
paper, therefore a brother in arms.

  She knew my feeling for her tar too
well, and treated me with a coquetry
that at times drove me wild and then
again would send me to the seventh
heaven of bliss. 1 had never known any
one who Could be so mercilessly cruel
and so enchantingly kind. She had eyes
that hypnotized or repelled at will, and
a voice sireaic in its low musical timbre.

  " I want to speak to you." she said
quietly, and I saw that the lines about
her rosy sensitive mouth were troubled

  1 pressed her hand tenderly, but for
the first time in our acquaintanceship
she seemed to take no notice. I could
not understand this. I glanced into her
face anxiously.

  “ How do you happen to be with
MichaeBn? ” she asked gravely.

 “ MiehaeEn? Michaelm?" I re-
peated stupidly- “ Is that who :t is? ”

  For a moment E could say nothing. 1
was too startled.

  “ Tell me—fell me." she said impa-
tiently. " This is a matter of life and
death”

  I	first made sure we could not be over-
heard . then plunged into my story.

  “ You poor boy. they knew your pas-
sion for news, and they used you.
Michaelin counted on your being blown
to atoms." she said gently, and her svf:
little gloved hand touched me in a
caressing fashion that well-nigh drove
me delirious.

  “ He is not in the antechamber/' she
said suddenly. “ He is among the
guests; I saw him mount the staircase
a moment ago.”

  All at once she grew rigid.

  " Put on your things and await me
at the entrance.” she said, with the air
of one accustomed to be obeyed.

  " But why ? Why ? “ I 't-unmered.

  *' Ivan, if you love me.” she whispered,
in accents that sen: a keen thrill of de-
light through my entire Leing.

  “ If you love me.”

  That nrvjuest from her would have
sent me to the Inferno.
  She left me; I hurried to the ante-
chamber. Officer B. was not there. I
found my cloak, and mystified, but obedi-
ent, left the building. At the door 1
met her, anxious and distraught, and to-
gether we entered her sleigh.

  She gave her order, and as we drove
off she turned to me.

  “ Do you know what you have done? ”
she asked me in English, as her soft
brown eyes sought mine in an anguish
that terrified me.

  A loud detonation in the direction of
the Gagarine palace caused us both to
rise simultaneously in our seats. The
driver looked back, cracked his horses
with an oath, then began to pray.

  11	A bomb ! A bomb! ” cried several
terrified voices near us.

  “ And you, Ivan, you admitted the
man that brought it,” Marie said, with a
shuddering sob of horror, as she hid her
face on my shoulder.

  All at once I understood. I remem-
bered the searching glance given my
companion by the policeman as we en-
tered the courtyard; the look of relief
as the officer, turning from my com-
panion. recognized me.

  The driver was still beating his horses.
We were going like the wind. There
Was the dull glare of fire in the blue of
the skies behind us.

  For the first time in my life, my
equilibrium was shaken beyond my con-
trol.

  “ I must go back. I must see what I
can do. There is my paper, you know.”

   “ You will get it all at the restaurant,”
she said disjointedly. “ You must not
go back. It is our lives now.”

  “ Then 1 will leave you. You must
not be seen with me,” I cried, alive, at
last, to my danger and the result of my
ghastly mistake.

  “ No, I stay with you, Ivan Petro-
witch. come what may.”

  The sleigh stopped before her door;
two men were standing on the curb-
stone, as if awaiting us. In Russia, when
two or three men are grouped together
it is apt to mean police surveillance. I
saw I had Marie in a trap. I knew she
dared not and would not argue with me
just then. I pressed her hand.

  “ Mademoiselle;" I said formally, “ I
will telephone you in an hour or two

from the restaurant, and I will call to
see you early to-morrow.”

  “ Thank you very much, Ivan Petro-
witch,” she replied, as she got out of the
sleigh. I did not follow her. I sat
where I was, and when the isn’ostschik
tucked the fur coverings about me, told
him to drive back to the palace.

  A cordon of police guarded the streets
near by. but my card admitted me
through the lines. To my intense relief,
I found all of my colleagues safe and
unharmed. The atmosphere was heavy
with the suppressed excitement and
nervousness of the moment. 1 learned
that Prince Gagarine was but slightly
hurt, that several unfortunate soldiers
had been blown to atoms, and that the
perpetrator of the outrage had stabbed
himself after he had thrown the bomb.

  Most of the windows in the palace
were shattered, and owing to the explo-
sion the electric wires were not in work-
ing order. Even as I was speaking to
a syndicate man, a body was brought out
on a stretcher. It was Officer. B. His
clothes showed the mauling he had re-
ceived at the hands of the crowd. Bend-
ing. a tall, burly soldier spat in the dead
face, and the sullen murmur of curses
deep and bitter followed the body.

  1 waited and waited, wondering what
was .next.

  Surely, I told myself, some one must
have seen us together. Officer B. and I.
The prefect of police came toward me;
I felt that this was the beginning, but
with a grave salutation he passed on.

  After a while, when it was certain that
there was nothing more to be learned,
my colleagues and myself departed.

  When we reached the restaurant one
of the group teased me because of the
pallor of my countenance.

  “ You are a new hand, Carrington,”
he said. " Wait till you see a few more
of these sights and you will become cal-
lous.”

  I	smiled a sickly smile. Two minutes
later we were all busy with our pens.

  “Any one know his name?” sang out
a voice suddenly.

  “ Michaelin,” I replied mechanically,
and a moment later could have bitten out
my tongue at the admission.

  “Not I In: Michaelin?” asked some
one.
  “ I really don't know," 1 replied.

  “ Well, we will let it go at .that," said
our dean.

  A few minutes more of scratching and
I rose. My cable was ready, and grab-
bing my hat, I rushed out.

  When 1 returned to the restaurant the
others had left. I got Marie on the tele-
phone and gave her the details of the
affair, until the other newspaper men re-
turned, when I closed the conversation.

  We journalists sat at our own table,
smoking and eating caviar sandwiches,
and listening to the older fellows as they
regailed us with stories of intrigue and
Nihilism that would make the flesh of
an oyster creep.

  It was dawn when we separated. I
went back to my rooms at the Hotel de
1’Europe, and I did not feel safe even
when I had locked and bolted my door.

  hong before noon, next day, I was
with Marie. She gave a great sigh of
relief as she saw me.

 "Has anything happened?” she
queried eagerly.

  11	Nothing,” I replied, “as yet.”

  She made me some tea; then in whis-
pers we spoke of the events of the previ-
ous evening.

  “ But you—how did you know about
Michaelin?” I asked, a dozen other
ideas surging through my brain mean-
while.

  “ My friend, I am a Pole. I have
ways and means of knowing things I
cannot reveal, but it was from a Nihilist
who loves me that I got the warning not
to go to the palace last night."

  “ Yet you did go? ”

  “ Yes, to pass it on to you."

  “Marie! Marie!"

  1 Ivas by her side in a moment.

  “ Then you do care a little? No—
No—you care more,” I whispered, in
breathless content, as 1 put my arms
about her.

  “ Marie, do you love me well enough
to marry me? ”

  The immutable smile of the Polish
women, that Smile that dazzles and con-
founds at once, bathed my soul in
ecstasy.

  " Love,” she whispered; “ that is a
big word.” Then she added carelessly.
" But I think 1 like you well enough to
marry—perhaps.”

  The sorcery in her tone and in her
manner played havoc with my feelings.
1 knelt at her feet and kissed her hands.

  She bent and kissed me, Polish fash-
ion, on the eyelids, then on the mouth.

  When I came to my senses I was at
the American consulate, in the sanctum
sanctorum of that august personage, ut-
tering a rambling, incoherent, and abom-
inably disconnected statement of facts.

  “ For Heaven's sake, Jack Carrington,
do stop blithering,” was the impatient
response that broke in on my overexcited
wits, dragging me from the heavenly
bliss of love to the reality of every-day
business.

  “ I am ready and waiting to tie the
knot. No explanations necessary. Where
is the lady?”

  As 1 stood beside my bride I was won-
dering how it all had happened. 1 re-
member urging the fact that at any mo-
ment I might be sent over the frontier.
What really was worrying me was the
fear that Marie might change her mind.
So she had consented? She must have,
or we would not be at the consulate.

  We spent our honeymoon of a week
in Moscow—a week that the very angels
must have envied—then my consul sum-
moned me to St. Petersburg.

  I was wanted by the prefect of police.
Before I left the consul I had told him
the entire history of the evening.

  He looked grave.

  “Humph!” he said slowly; “this
means banishment, if not worse. 1 will
communicate with the embassy at once
and head off these fellows.”

  The prefect received me as soon as I
arrived.

  “ I am sorry, Mr. Carrington, to have
to inform you that you will have to leave
the country within forty-eight hours."

  “ What do you mean ? ” I asked indig-
nantly. "What have you against me?
What have I done?"

  "Done?” he echoed, in his dignified
basso. “ Why, you sent that Anitchkoff
palace story to America before we knew
of it.”

  1 burst out laughing.

  “ And so because I saved your G'zar's
life you would banish me?”

  He rose, dignified and stately.

  " Mr. Carrington,” he said slowly,
“ putting ii in that light, I think perhaps

I can show you some leniency, irat in

  I	bowed, inwardly chuckling. Of the
other affair he knew nothing, therefore, I
was safe In my haste to get home and
give the news to Marie I stumbled over
one of my colleagues in the entry.

  His face wore a sour and sullen ex-
press ion.

  “ Congratulations, old man. But
about that Anitchkoff palace plot, you
played us a dirty trick—keeping it to
yourself."

  “ Oh, hang the Anitchkoff plot,” I
cried airily. “ Ancient history; what of
it? Tell the boys to come round to-

   A word to the consul to prevent com-
plications there, and I was at last steer-
ing for home.

   Marie met me. her eyes like two stars.
'■ I know—I know." she whispered:
“ 1 heard it from the prefect’s office ten
minutes ago.”

   I	looked at her in amazement. In the
room with the prefect and myself had
been no one.

   Then I kissed her and laughed. I did
not take the trouble even to question
her.

   Such is Russia. •

ROSS WAY.

TWO. men rode down the steep
banks of Muddy Run and met in
midstream.

       One was a brawny, bushy-
whiskered man on a proud-stepping sad-
dle-horse, while the other was a lank
youth whose angles showed that he had
not quite reached his full growth. The
youth's horse was a shaggy, bony crea-
ture which seemed to have been often
exposed to the weather. As the horses
reached to drink, the man turned in his
saddle and faced the youth fiercely.

  “ Ain’t I tole you-all to keep away
from my girl?" he demanded. ' Po’r,
apron-stringed, putterin', shiftless, no-
account boy! What for you-uns think
teh go with her. eh?”

  “ Because I ’low she loves me!" the
youth drawled, facing the man squarely,
but without displaying any emotion.

  The man gasped.

  " What's fiiat! ” he shouted.

  Then he plunged at the youth and
both fell from, their horses into the run-

ning water, where they fought, rolled
over and over by the current till they
lodged on a grave! bar ten rods down
stream. There the man came uppermost,
and pounded his opponent’s face to his
heart's content.

  When he ceased, the youth was limp
and insensible.

  "There. Clinr Tazewell!" the man
said, ‘ I ’low nex' time Lon Campbell
tells ye to.keep clear of his. yo’ll mind! "

  With that he rode away on his horse,
while the shaggy mare snutiled over the
prostrate figure in the water, wondering
what was the matter.

  An hour later Tazewell began to re-
cover consciousness. He tried to open
his eyes, but found them painfully swol-
len. Pe could feel the water lapping
against his clothes and, gradually, he
remembered what had happened.

  The rough clinch at the ford, the fall
into the water, the struggle for foothold
and fist-freedom were recalled little by
little, and a? last he «at up and held an
eye open to look about him. There was
his faithful mare, and up stream was
the gash made by the bridle-path in the
steep banks of the run.

  “ Law! Law! ” he muttered. “ That
man done whupped me, he shore did'
He beat me all up! ”
THE ALL-STORY MAGAZINE.

  He rose to his feel, painfully climbed
to the saddle and clucked to the mare,
telling her to go home, making a sorry
figure as he rode along, clinging with
both hands to the pommel, his face
swollen and his clothes pulled and torn
awry. Two of his neighbors saw him
pass by, but made no attempt to stop
or question him. They had seen Lon
Campbell go down the road and they
had divined what had happened. They
were surprised that young Tazewell had
escaped with only a “ beating up.”
Arriving at his home, Clint dismounted
and turned his horse into the pasture.
Then he felt his way to the little log
house where his mother met him face
to face at the door.

  “ My land, Clint, what has hap-
pened?” she cried.

  “ Campbell—Lon Campbell don hit! ”
he answefed. “ He beat me up ! ”

  The mother led her son to a chair
before the open fireplace and made him
sit down. Then she killed a chicken
and bandaged his face with the warm
meat next to his skin, soothing him all
the while as he choked back the sobs
that came into his throat. At last, she
had done every thing she could for him.

  “Thehl” she said. “You’ll soon be
all right, Clinty.”

  “Jes’ wait tell I can see!” he gasped
suddenly. “Jes' wait tell I can see them
sights! ”

  “ Oh. Clint! ” she said. “ Don’t!
Don’t! Le's don’ have no shootin’ up.
He's her father. She’d never forgive
ye."

  He made no reply, and for days after
sat in ominous silence while the swelling
of the bruises gradually disappeared,
leaving his face a ghastly yellow hue.

  In a week’s time he was working
about the little place, shucking corn,
cutting wood, and making things snug
for the winter. Day by day his mother
begged him not to arouse the wrath of
the Campbells by killing their leader.
Her one convincing argument was:

  “ His gal never will love you no
more, if you kill him."

  Nothing else appealed to Clint—much
less fear of the numerous Campbells.
He felt that there were not enough of
them to satisfy his lust for revenge on
the family which held itself so much

above the Tazewells that they frowned
upon his courting pretty Laura. Hut,
of course, he excepted her from the plans
of vengeance which he was secretly lay-
ing in His heart. His mother convinced
him that he must see Laura first.

  The time came when he once more
crossed the ridges to the Copper Bottoms,
where he sat down in the orchard on
the little knoll behind Lon Campbell’s
house. The shades were down, but a
bright light was burning within. He
mimicked the whippoorwill’s song with
a low whistle. It had never failed be-
fore, but there was no answer to it now.
He repeated it several times, but without
avail. The girl did not come. Never-
theless, it was evident that the call had
been heard, for the light was quickly
extinguished when his plaintive notes
quavered in the night.

  Clint waited long, but no sound came
to warm his heart. As he sat there,
he realized that he had lost the girl, un-
less he could “ do something.”

  " That man’s watching her like a
hawk,” he said to himself, “ I’ll shore
have teh settle with him first. Yasseh! ”

  He turned homeward, wondering just
what he had better . do—wondering
whether to go riding the bridle-paths
rifle in hand to kill his sweetheart's fa-
ther, or to “ wait his chance.” It was
late when he climbed to his husk bed
in the garret of his home. Next day
his mother did not call him, for she
knew he had been out late the night
before.

  The morning was just half gone when
Lon Campbell rode up the bridle-path
to the Widow Tazewell’s little farm.
She was at the spring-house drawing
a bucket of water when he arrived within
speaking distance.

  Campbell was not unacquainted with
Mrs. Tazewell. His errand that morn-
ing was not so much to seek Clint as
it was to humble her pride. He remem-
bered the time when the Clintons were
set against him because he was poor and
no-account, and, though he had after-
ward “ married well," the memory had
never lost its sting, especially now that
he wai a widower.

  'Lida Clinton's charms had never been
entirely out of his mind, and now that
she was Ihe Widow Tazewell, he longed
LOVES CROSSWAY.

to glery over her poverty and supposed
distress.

  He saw her before she caught sight
of mm, and had opportunity to notice
that her carriage was not less, graceful
than it had been when she was a girl.
As she turned at the sound of his horse's
hoofs, he noted that there was still a
saucy tilt :o her nose and a poise to her
head" which had always stirred the anger
in his heart, it was so proud and inde-
pendent. Now the woman's pride almost
pleased him, he was so sure that he
could humble it by a threat.

  " Look a hyar, Mrs. Tazewell,” he
began. “ Whah’s that son of youm? I
ain' got no hawd feelin's agin you-all,
but 1 tell you naow, ef you don' keep
that poh white-trash son of youm to
hum. I’ll—I’ll-”

  “ An' what'll you do, Lon Campbell? ”
the woman demanded with a toss of her
head.

  The question and the way it was put
were so unexpected that Campbell was
abashed. The next moment the accumu-
lated wrath of years welled from his
heart, and he cursed the family and the
son of the woman whom he had loved in
his youth.

  “ That patched an’ gangling boy of
yourn'll shore git hurt if he don' keep
away from my gal! ” he exclaimed. 11 1
got betteh ideas than havin' her marry in'
inteh side-hill pone-eaters, an' I tell ye
naow. my gal’s got a sweetheart as has
money an' clothes an' sense, he shore
has.' An' you keep that Clint Tazewell
home, I tell ye! ”

  The woman laughed in his face, as he
jerked his horse around and drove away
down the bridle-path at a gallop. The
way to the woods was not far, fortunately
for him. As he disappeared. Clint
sprang through the doorway, rifle in
hand, just too late to ge: a shot.

  “ Clint! Clint' ” M:Tazewell cried.

  It was a long time before she could
quiet him. nor did she succeed until she
had explained the fact that Campbell
had courted her in her youth, her ready
wit divining the chief reason for Camp-
bell's visit. She told her son that
Campbell's daughter was being courted
by some one else. Clir.t listened quietly
enough, and then said:

  " 1 'low I'd betteh see that man. I

reckon I know him. He's Tip Callo-
way. He works in a store an' wears a
white collar.”

  A few days later Clint met Tip on the
road between Kyle's Ford and Copper
Bottoms.

  “ Naow. see here. Mr. Tip Calloway.”
Clint drawled, shifting his repeater from
the crook of his elbow. 111 'low they ain't
no use of your cornin' up this road no
moh. You-all's rich, but we-uns shoots
right smart, yasseh! We shoots right
smart.”

  Tip's pale face twitched, but he was
not the kind of youth to make a fight
Without a word he turned his horse
around to gallop back to Kyle's Ford.
There was much to dread from such a
lank, red-looking mountaineer. Clint
grinned over his easy victory. He had
expected a harder fight.

  The experience with Tip gave him
confidence, for his struggle with Lon
Campbell, who was a grown man, much
feared by the timid souls of the region.

  Campbell supposed that he had cowed
Clint, till he heard that Tip Calloway
had been “ run out of the country," then
his wrath was boundless.

  First of all. he sent word to Clint by
a neighbor that he was going to repeat
the beating that had taken place in
Muddy Run. Then he told his daugh-
ter what Clint had done, fancying that
Clint’s impudence would make her as
wrathful as it had made him. Instead,
it surprised and pleased her. She had
willingly turned from Clint when site
heard how he had been whipped by her
father, not knowing that he had come to
see her one night when she was visiting
her aunt.

  She knew now that Clint cared, and
that lie had courage that reached above
a mere whipping. But the fact that her
father had threatened to beat Clint again
frightened her. She understood the
Clinton Tazewell spirit better than her
father did.

  “ Oh, pop!'' she said. “ what's the use
of whipping him again? He’s jest a boy
—an' you're a big man. Besides—be-
sides-"

  •'Huh!" the man answered, “ I'll
whip him twict as hard! I shore will ’

  The girl made no answer, bat fear
came to" her heart—the fear that her
lover would kill the man whose threats
were scattered in all directions now.
The neighbors talked of the “ trouble,”
wondering what its next turn would be.
There was only one question any one
asked, and that was:

  “What’ll Clint do? Will he let that
man beat him up again? He cayn't fight
him with his fists”

  Most of them thought Clint would
shrink from fighting the man, knowing
how many relatives there were to take
up the quarrel if Clint should “ go to
war ”—use his rifle, that is. But some
few, I.aura among the rest, feared that
Clint had just that courage—the courage
that would not count the odds against
him. One day her fears were shown to
tie justified. Mabel Green, her dearest
friend, brought her some news.

  “ Clint’s riding up an' down the roads
a sight more'n he used to do,'" Mabel
told her. “ Mostly he has his rifle with
him, but he ain’t saying anything to
anybody. Even his mother is plumb
scar’rt up about what he’s doing; he's
that quiet an' don't say anything even
to her.”

   Laura's heart fluttered at this news.

  “ He’ll kill him! He’ll kill him!” she
cried to herself. “ Pop’s so hard head-
ed! I mustn't let him do it! I
mustn’t! ”

  That night Laura did a strange thing
for a Campbell to do.

  She slipped out of her house and ran
up among the ridges to beg for mercy
from an enemy of her father. She came
up the path to the Tazewell clearing and
whistled—whistled like a mocking-bird
—a sound which she knew Clint was not
likely to ignore.

  Clint was by the fireplace, cleaning
his rifle. He started, but his mother
had turned her face to listen, and so did
not notice the motion.

  “My land!” she said. “I never
knowed a mocking-bird to sing like that
this time of year before! Huh! ”

  “ Hit's a young un. an' I ’low I‘ll go
ketch hit! " Clint remarked, taking down
his hat. As he pas>ed through the door-
way his mother's face lightened up.

  “ Lawse! ” she said to herself.
“ Hit's some friend of hisn. 1 might
of knowed! ”

  Even she didn't dream of a Campbell

coming at night to ask for what Laura
was about to ask.

  As the days had gone by, Campbell
had made more threats. Instead of
threatening to beat Clint, the fact that
the youth was carrying a rifle caused
him to carry his own—and he changed
the threat from a whipping to shooting
the youth. Only Laura had dared to
interfere, and failing with her father,
she came to his intended victim.

  As Clint came to her in the bridle-
path she threw her arms around his neck
and began to cry. Clint could only gasp
and stutter.

  “ Don’t kill my father!" she cried.
“ Don't kill him! He’s all I got!
Mammy's dead, an’ you’ll kill him!
Don’t, Clint! Don’t!”

  “ He’s got a gun to kill me with, an' I
’low I’ll shore shoot back!” Clint ex-
claimed. “ I ain't never looked for
trouble with any man. I'm peaceable,
but they ain’ no man can run me around
like your dad ’lows to do. I’ll shore
shoot, if he draws down his gun, I shore
will! ”

  The girl wept and begged, but Clint
would not agree to do anything she said.
He would not even go away for a little
while till her father’s wrath had died
down. Weeping and sobbing, she pulled
herself awav from her lover and started
down the road. He followed, trying to
explain why he could not do as she
wished, but she only wept the more.
He would promise her anything, except
what she asked.

  Suddenly she seized him again.

  “ Oh, Clint, promise me—don’t kill
him—ies’ hit him in the leg, or arm—
don’t kill him! ”

  Clint hesitated.

  “ I’ll try not to!" he exclaimed, and
then the girl ran down the path and dis-
appeared before he thought to accom-
pany her home.

  For several days Clint did not stir
abroad, for his heart was moved more
by the girl's plea than he was willing to
admit. He was a good shot, much bet-
ter than Lon Campbell, for he depended
on squirrels and quail and wild turkeys
for most of his fresh meat, and killing
game made him expert with his rifle.

  He pleaded with himself that he was
merely “ practising" and not avoiding
LOVE’S CROSS WAY.

a meeting, but in his heart Tie knew that
he did not want to kill a man, much
less the father of the girl he loved.
What two or three friends whom he met
told him did not quiet his apprehension.
They said that Campbell vowed to shoot
on sight.

  But at last the meal was low in the
box, and Clint had to ride over to the
mill to have the grist ground. Taking
down his rifle, he examined it carefully
and then started away just as the sun
lighted the trees on top of the Big Ridge.

  His mother watched him go down the
path.

  When he was out of sight she turned
to do the housework, but the dragging
minutes were painful. Tragedy seemed
to be hanging in the air. Her thoughts
turned to Lon Campbell, of all persons
in the world the one with whom she
wished her son to be at peace. Till then
the quarrel had not seemed real, or dead-
ly, but the whole force of the danger
was plain at last—the rumors, the light
in Muddy Run, the threats, and at last
the careful handling of the rifle and
testing of the trigger proved to her un-
willing heart that it was only too true.

  She had pleaded with her son “ not to
mind,” but with as little avail as Laura's
pleading with Campbell had been.

   “ I cayn’t let them fight! ” the woman
cried in her heart. “ Oh! what can I
do ? What can I do ? ’’

  Her son was obdurate, but. perhaps,
she could prevail upon the man who
had been her sweetheart. With that
thought she seized a little red shawl
and hurried down the short-cut path to
Copper Bottoms. With swift, pattering
feet, she passed the mountain laurels,
crossed the little runs, scaled the ridge
cliff, and ran down the long slope to
the Campbell fields. Without stopping
or pausing, she ran to the painted house
and opened the door without knocking.

   Laura was sitting before the fireplace,
weeping and alone. The girl looked up,
and the next minute they were in each
other’s arms.

   “ Pop's gone to the mill," Laura said.

11	He’s be’n gone an hour, an’ more.”

  In anguish the women stared at each
other. They knew from long experi-
ence in the mountains that a tragedy was
impending, and they were powerless to

avert it. Trembling, silent, with tears
.filling their eyes at intervals, they sat and
waited.

  The rustic of a chicken among the
woodchips behind the house, the grunt
of a hog beyond the fence, the shrill cry
of some bird made them start with ex-
clamations. The clock ticked slowly
along, each tick bringing the mountain
women closer to the saddest thing they
have to bear. The rasping of wheels
and cogs, the unlimbering of catches and
levers suddenly broke the monotone, and
the clock began to strike.

  A minute later from up the Mill road
they heard three faint sounds.

  “ Spat! Spat! Spat! ”

  “ Oh! He’s done hit! He’s done hit!
He’s killed my po’h daddy!” the girl
cried, springing to her feet in a paroxysm
of agony.

  •	" Mebbe he missed! Mebbe-” Mrs.

Tazewell sobbed into the girl’s ears, her
own heart misgiving her. Then they
wept together, louder than ever.

   Clint had been the first to bring a toll
to the mill that morning. Others soon
followed, however, and Clint found him-
self among neighbors whose silence
quickened his nervousness. They merely-
greeted him. but among themselves they
gave significant glances toward the rifle
he carried, and more than one watched
the trail as though expecting some one.
Clint was glad to ride away on his mare.
The lonely bridle-path was more com-
panionable than neighbors who won-
dered whether he would be murdered or
a murderer.

   As he rode along the trail his indigna-
tion began to grow. He asked himself
what he had clone that any man should
want to take his life?

  “I'm peaceable!" he exclaimed bit-
terly. “ I neveh harmed any man! I
ain’ a bad, mean man. But that Lon
Campbell, he alius has be’n troublesome.
He killed a man! He whupped Ole
Leedin! He whupped ’Lise Wheeler!
He whupped me! We neveh done him no
harm! lie ain’ no right to treat me so!
Hit ain’ no right, an’ I ainjt goin’ to
stand hit 110 moh! I’m goin’ straight to
’him, an’ have hit aout! Yassah! I'll drap
my cohn at the Forks an’ ride right down
theh! ”

  At the forks in the trail Clint hung
758

the corn-meal on the limb jjf a tree and
started down the path toward Copper
Bottoms. As he rode his spirits rose.
Heretofore, he had dreaded meeting his
tormentor, but now he hurried his horse
toward the man's home. He forgot the
girl, for he was after vengeance now.

  He passed the same houses whose oc-
cupants a few weeks before had seen him
riding past, a wet, bruised, and dejected
figure. The men, women, and children
saw him now. and most of them under-
stood the difference in his bearing.

  “Clint’s on the war-path!” Ranee
Wheeler exclaimed. “ I knowed hit
Av’n’t in a Tazewell or a Clinton to be
undertrod an’ stomped on. Hue!
Theh'll be a difference teh the echo in
this yeah fightin'! ”

  Eager as Clint was for the meeting,
it came sooner than he expected.

  As he rode down the bank at Muddy
Run ford. Campbell came into sight on
the far side of the stream, not thirty
yards away. Instantly Campbell jerked
his rifle from its saddle holster and start-
ed to throw it to his shoulder, while
Clint, startled and surprised, merely
stared. It was Campbell's opportunity,
but he wasted it by firing without taking
aim. The bullet tore through Clint’s
hat as he brought up his own rifle to
take a quick, sure “ turkey shot.”

  Campbell, seeing the rifle come true,
realized that he was facing death. Then
the sights dropped from the man’s eye
and disappeared in smoke. A blow like
a sledge-hammer landed on his elbow,
followed by another 011 his knee. His
horse reared, threw the wounded man,
and galloped into the brush. The next
minute Clint was beside his victim.

   11	I didn't 'low teh kill ye. Mars Camp-
bell ! " Clint said. “ I don’ aim to kill

ary man, so I shot ye nice an’ simple like.
I don’ want no bawd feelin's, bec’ase
I’m goin’ to marry that gal of your’n.
yasseh! I'll shore do hit, even if I have
to shoot the hull Campbell family easy! ”
“ I 'low I cayn’t help hit. Clint.”
Campbell exclaimed. “ You was plumb
reasonable with me, yasseh! Thankee,
lad. I'll ride yer mare home. They ain'

110	hawd feelin’s no moh. Tell you’
mah I asts her pawdon. I've be’n
mighty onmannerly with her.”

  Steadying the man in the saddle, Clint
helped him homeward. When they ar-
rived at Campbell’s house the two women
were roused from their despair by a
shout. They rushed to the door, and as
they opened it Clint called out:

  “ Come an' he’p. Maw! You here!"
The three carried the wounded man
to a bed. where they dressed his wounds.
At last Laura and Clint slipped away.

  “ I jes’ knowed you’d be light on my
old daddy! ” the girl exclaimed, hug-
ging Clint spasmodically.

  “ Sh-h! ’’ said Clint. “ What’s that? ”
Both heard a gentle “ smack ” in the
room where the man was lying.

  “ Old daddy alius did admiah yo
mammy,” the girl whispered with a lit-
tle laugh. “ Oh, Clint, they ain’ no
trouble no moh! Hue! ”

  “ Hit's powerful sweet, little honey-
bee!” Clint answered, drawing the girl
closer to him.

  Next day. when Ranee Wheeler heard
“ the latest.” he said to his wife:

  “ Didn't I tole they'd be a dif'rence

111	the echo? I wandeh will Clint marry
his stepsister, c-r will his mother mar-
ry his father-in-law? Peahs lak thehs
alius somethin' teh bother a man ’bout

neveh can tell what they’ll do next.”

MRS. JONES'S SOUVENIR-PARTY

               By Charles Edward Rich.

 '^T’HETHER one takes a spoon
 or a house and lot, a rob-
 bery's a robbery for all of that.

  I WILL not be- a party to this business
any longer. It’s got to stop, as far
as this family is concerned. What
do you think my business associates
would say if they knew that my wife
and her friends went around nights
sneak-thieving? ”

  Richard Jones, stock broker, moderate
circumstances, short, fat, and forty,
stamped up and down his dining-room,
indignation shining in his usually mild
blue eyes.

  There were after-dinner coffee-cups in
great variety, spoons, knives and forks,
ash-trays, brass match-boxes, wine-
glasses and salt and pepper bottles. To
each article was tied a small card by a
narrow ribbon. The cards were in-
scribed after this fashion:

   THE WIMBLEDON, Oct. 6.

                           (Charley’s Birthday.)

   WOOD'S CAFE, Nov. 20.

                          (New Year's Eve.)

   THE BEAULAC.

                            (Spring Handicap.)

  And so they went on. with little,
parenthetical references to remind one
of some specially notable event, as boys
and girls used to write in the corners
of the pages of autograph albums—
“ blonde hair ”—“ apple dumplings "—

“ band concert ”—all Greek, except to
the initiated.

  “ But Richard, it is not thieving," pro-
tested pretty Mrs. Jones, who was
gathering from all parts of the house a
curious collection of articles of brass,
silver and china ware, and laying them
out on the dining-table, .until the room
began to look like an antique shop. She
had been gazing at the collection with
pride and satisfaction until her husband
had entered the room with his protest.

  “ Well, if it's not thieving, why don't
you help yourselves to a dollar or two
out of the till?” retorted Jones, with an
answer-that-if-you-can sort of a grunt.

  “ Oh, but that’s different. There are
pleasant memories attached to these
things.”

  “ Humph. I dare say the proprietors
of the restaurants have pleasant memo-
ries of them, but they are no longer
attached to them. Anyway, so far as
this household goes, it's got to stop and

I	am going to stop it. Think of my
reputation as a business man. Suppose,
on one of your souvenir nights when
you are all gloating and making merry
over your ill-gotten spoils, a detective
should walk in and march us all off to
the station-house, eh? How would that
do for a pleasant memory? I tell you
it is downright stealing.”

  “ Now, Richard, you know we all
spend a lot of money when we go out
together for an evening.”

  “ Yes, and then steal the restaurant
man's profits. Something on the line of
high finance. I will admit, but in this
case the law may reach you one of these
days.”

  Jones swept the table with a con-
temptuous glance and strode out of the
house. On the way to his office an idea
suddenly occurred to him. He stopped,
smiled broadly and slapped his knee to
emphasize his glee.
760

THE AI.I.-STORY MAGAZINE.

  “ I'll do it," he said half-aloud. “ It
will be a master-stroke. I’ll bet it will
break up these souvenir-nights, all
right.”

  Chuckling to himself over his bright
thought he started on again.

  Jones himself had taken part in some
of these festive raids, but as his house
and those of his friends began to fill up
with the spoils of the restaurants, he be-
gan to consider the matter seriously, and
when the display of each one’s season's
plunder was made the occasion of a
“ party," he protested.

  He stopped again. A policeman
turned the corner ahead of him and
walked hurriedly toward him. It was
Sergeant Cahill, of the precinct, who was
under obligations to Jones, through
whose influence he had obtained his ad-
vancement from the ranks. The robust
figure of the policeman fitted so nicely
into his plans that Jones chuckled again.

  “Just like an inspiration,” he said,
smiling, as Cahill reached him.

  “ Did a man pass you under full
sail ? ” the sergeant asked as he shook
hands with Jones. Cahill had been a
sailor before he joined the force.

  “What’s that?” asked Jones.

  “ Scudding before the wind.”

  “ You mean, Cahill, did I see a man
running? Nope, no one passed me at
an accelerated speed.” and having fired
this back at the sergeant he figured that
he was about even.

  11	I wonder where he got to?” mur-
mured Cahill.

  “Where who got to?” asked Jones.

  “ ‘ Slick Bill.’ I sighted him dead
ahead and clapped on all sail, but he
has outfooted me, somehow. He's slick
all right."

  “Want to arrest him?”

  “No; haven’t got anything against
him now, I want to run him out of my
precinct. He is dangerous."

  “ Well now, Cahill, forget William
for a minute as long as he hasn't done
anything yet. I want your help in a
little plan I have in mind."

  “ You know you can’t ask too much of
me if it's in my way to do it." said Cahill
earnestly.

  He was one of those peculiarly con-
stituted persons who remember a favor
after they have reaped the benefit of it.

  “ Now, this is the case, sergeant. My
wife and a lot of her friends, all decent
people, you know, have developed into
souvenir fiends.”

  “ Um,” interrupted Cahill, “ swiping
the pewter, eh ? ”

  “ Yes, I guess that’s it, only in most
cases it is more valuable than pewter.
Well, you see, they look at this as a
harmless little pastime and when they
get a good collection, after a busy
season of dining out, they give a series
of souvenir-parties—that's what they
call ’em, Cahill, I give you my word—
at one another’s houses and display their
booty for the edification of their guests.
Now I want to stop it. There’s a
souvenir-night on at my house to-night."

  “ And what do you want me to do,
Mr. Jones, pinch the bunch?"

  “ No, no,” cried Jones in alarm, “ that
would be going too far. What I want
you to do is to give them a scare, don’t
you know.”

  “ Um,” said Cahill, very much as if
he needed more light.

  “ This is the idea. I want you to
come to my house to-night and demand
to search it for stolen goods that you
have been informed are secreted there.
After indignant protests I will admit
you and you will go to the dining-room,
which will be ringing with the joyous
sounds of mirth as my guests inspect the
display of souvenirs and recall to one
another the 1 pleasant memories that are
attached to them.’ See?

  “ Then you will denounce the assem-
bled multitude, myself included, and tell
them that it is with regret that you can-
not arrest them all. but that your orders
from the captain are simply to recover
the goods, as the restaurant proprietors
wish to be lenient this time—but the
next—well, the next time will be differ-
ent, and in the meantime they will all be
under police surveillance wherever thev
go."

  Jones’s idea grew as he went along
and he had to stop to chuckle as he
thought of the consternation of his
souvenir guests.

  “ And say, Cahill,” he continued,
letting out another seam in his idea, “ in
order that the thing shall have a stronger
effect, you insist on taking all of our own
silver from the sideboard.
MRS. JONES'S SOUVENIR-PARTY.

761

  “ 1 Captain’s orders '—very sternly—
‘ you can come down to the house and
straighten it out with the boss—if any of
the stuff is yours.’

   “ Throw a lot of sarcasm into the last.
I will go down to the police station in
the morning and sort out our stuff and
send the rest back, anonymously, to the
restaurant keepers. I think that is about
all. Cahill. Will you fix up the job
for me? ”

  “ Um.” said the sergeant. “ want to
throw the gaff in hard, don’t you?”

  “ 1 am not quite sure that 1 follow
you. Cahill.” said Jones, whose vocabu-
lary of slang was as limited as his
nautical knowledge, “ but I want to give
them a good, strong object-lesson."

  “ I am sorry. Mr. Jones, that I cannot
do this for you myself, but I am on the
desk to-night. I will send up one of the
plain-clothes men. though, with a full
tip on the play.”

   “ Well, that will have to do then, but,
of course, if you could do the thing your-
self, I would have more confidence that
it would be handled with skill. Say,
Cahill ”—another bright idea had blos-
somed in Jones’s fertile brain—“send
up the gruffest and most insolent man
that you have on your staff. It will
hit harder.”

   Cahill looked grieved.

  “ We don't have any insolent men on
the force, Mr. Jones,” he said in a tone
of mild rebuke.

  “ Oh. I beg pardon; 1 mean one who
can pretend to be insolent. It will do
just as well.”

  “ All right. I will send up a man who
will turn the trick as well as 1 could,
and t will give him a hunch on the
gruff end of the game. You won't find
him pleasant company.”

  “That’s it," chuckled Jones, “you’ve
caught my idea exactly. Send him up
after ten o'clock; then they’ll all be
there to get their little lesson.”

  “ By the way. I have forgotten the
number of your house.” said the ser-
geant. taking his note-book from his
pocket.

  “Number twenty-nine, West -

Street." The sergeant made a note of
the address.

  The men parted. Cahill to take an-
other look for “ Slick Bill ” while Jones,

highly elated at his scheme, waited for
a car.

  Jones was in his merriest mood.

  He welcomed his "guests with the
warmest cordiality and no host could
have been more eager to entertain them.
He moved about the rooms, from one
group to another, with a jolly tw-inkle
in his eyes and a ready jest upon his
tongue. Jones was surely at his best.
One of the guests reported that he had
seen him sneak out into the hall and
chuckle to himself in a dark corner.
Mrs. Jones marveled at the transforma-
tion from the severe moralist of the
morning.

  Only in one way did Jones violate the
laws of hospitality. He glanced con-
stantly at his watch, but, as he did it
surreptitiously, it perhaps should not be
recorded against him. Every time he
looked his chuckle became more and
more audible. Finally, the last guest
arrived and all were seated at little
tables in the parlor. It was a progres-
sive euchre night and, as the bell at the
head table sounded, the chatter ceased
and the players gave themselves up to
the serious task of fighting for the first
prize.

  Down at the end of the hall, on a
side table in the dining-room, the
souvenirs were displayed, where, before
supper was served, the guests might
laugh and joke over the “ pleasant mem-
ories ” they recalled.

  The silence in the middle of the
second hand was broken by a loud peal
of the front-door bell. Jones looked up
from his cards in surprise. It was no
belated guest, for all were accounted for,
or present. He looked at his’ watch.
It was only half past nine. “Cahill
has made a mistake in the hour,” thought
Jones as he listened anxiously as the
maid's 'footsteps sounded on the stairs in
going io the door.

  Whoever it was lacked a spirit of
patience, for the bell rang twice again
before the girl could reach the door.
With a common impulse every one
stopped playing and listened for de-
velopments.

  “ Perhaps baby’s been taken sick and
they have sent for me," said one nervous
woman in a whisper to her neighbor.
  “ I always feel creepy when our bell
rings like that. It’s nearly always bad
news or a telegram. Those boys have
no consideration for one’s nerves." And
another woman began to show signs of
anxiety.

  By this time the maid had opened the
door.

  "Is this the Jones joint?” a voice
inquired gruffly.

  Every one started at the coarseness
of the tone and question—every one
except Jones.

  “ Cahill is on time," he chuckled to
himself behind his handkerchief. “ Now
the fun will begin.”

  “ I don't know what you mean,” re-
plied the maid tartly.

  "Oh, well, does Jones live here?”

  “ Mister Jones lives here,” said the
girl with proper emphasis on the
“ mister.”

  “ Tell the boss I want to see him and
don't keep the law waiting in the hall
either, my pretty maid.”

  There were cries of astonishment from
the guests and Jones rose from his chair
with well-assumed amazement.

  “ The law," he gasped. “ What can
it mean?”

  Jones was a good actor.

  “ My dear, I will see this person," he
said, turning to his wife. “ Do not be
nervous; it is some mistake, of course.
Please excuse me for a moment.”

  He bowed ceremoniously to his guests
and left the room.

  Just inside the hall-door stood a tall,
heavily built man, with his coat-collar
turned up around his neck and his
slouch hat, which he did not remove,
drawn down over his eyes. He carried
a large market-basket on his arm.

  "You may go, Bessie,” said Jones to
the girl, who seemed inclined to stay
and see the play to its climax. As she
turned away Jones winked merrily. The
man returned the courtesy.

  “Well, sir," said Jones, the comedian,
in a pompous tone, “ to what felicitous
circumstance am I indebted for this
visit? ”

  “Are you Jones?” The man winked
again.

  “ I am Mr. Jones.”

  Another wink, and the signals having
established them on an ecfual footing of

understanding the play moved rapidly

on.

  “ Well, you'll do and if you arc trying
to ask me what I want I'll give it to
you straight. I want them sooveneers
you and your fine frens swiped—an’ I
want 'em quick, sec ? "

  Jones heard gasps of fear and amaze-
ment from the parlor and he knew his
lesson was sinking in. How he did want
to laugh.

  “ But, my dear sir," he said with a
fine show of perturbation, “ I don't know
who you are."

 "Who I am? I'm Gallagher from
the precinct station and de sergeant’s
orders are to bring back the stuff, or
youse. You can shake dice to see which,
but you’ve got to be quick about it.’’

  “ But, my dear sir-”

  "None o’ yer dear sirs, now, Jones.
Get busy. I've got orders to search de
house—an’ wid de aid of a gun, too.
Now run along, sonny, and put me next
to de stuff or I’ll pull in de whole
caboodle of yer.”

  More gasps from the parlor.

  “ There lias been some grave mistake,"
said Jones with dignity which was some-
what marred by another wink. “If you
will step this way I will show you some
trifles that my friends and myself have
picked up during some jolly evenings
around town, but I assure you they were
all well paid for in the restaurant bills
we had to settle.”

  Jones, with his head held high in the
air, led the way, followed by the man,
into the dining-room.

  “ I shall see my friend Sergeant Cahill
in the morning and somebody will suffer
for this outrage, I assure you. my dear
sir.”

  “ Aw, quit yer kiddin’—it was Cahill
sent me.’’

  They entered the dining-room and
Jones turned up the gas.

  “1 Sooveneer blowout,’ says Cahill,
an’ I guess he hit a four time winner,”
commented Gallagher as lie glanced
quickly around the room. He went
straight to the side-table where the sou-
venirs were tastefully displayed and,
quickly picking out the tableware,
dumped it into the basket he carried.

  “' Never mind the crockery,' says
Cahill. ‘ Let ’em keep that! ”’
MRS. JONES’S SOUVENIR-PARTY.

   Having cleaned off the table of every-
thing except the cups and glasses Galla-
gher turned his attention to the side-
board with another wink at Jones, which
was promptly returned, accompanied by
a low chuckle.

  By this time the guests, with Mrs.
Jones in the van, quaking with fear and
anxiety but drawn by a strange fascina-
tion to the scene, had flocked out of the
parlor and gathered at the dining-room
door. They were wondering how soon
their own homes would be visited by this
coarse detective who was so rough in his
manners.

   Evenin’, folks," said Gallagher, with
a broad smile that encompassed the
whole gathering. “ Sorry to bust up yer
little party, but law’s law."

  Again the guests trembled at that
dreadful little word and Gallagher con-
tinued to toss the silverware from the
sideboard into his basket. Then he
opened the drawers and piled in hands-
ful of knives, forks, and spoons. By this
time the basket was full and Mrs. Jones
had recovered her speech.

  “ Richard." she cried hysterically,
“ you are not going to let him carry away
our own silver?”

  “ Sorry, my dear, but those are his
orders. Don’t worry ; I will straighten
this all out in the morning with my
friend Cahill.”

  “ But some of those things he is ta-
king are our wedding presents. You
know that.”

  “ You and Jones here, may know,
ma'am, but how am I to know ’em
from soovies. Down to the station they've
got to go. Evenin’. I’ll see you all
later.”

  Gallagher eased the basket on his arm
and marched triumphantly through the
lane made by the guests, who drew back
to let him pass. In another moment the
front door opened and closed after
Gallagher and the “ soovies.”

   There was a long silence, during which
the guests looked anxiously at one
another and Jones choked an almost
irresistible desire to laugh by a violent
spell of coughing. After the departure
of Gallagher Mrs. Jones had vainly tried
to find her tongue again, but could only
utter little gasps.

   “ It's retribution,” said Jones, drawing

down the corners of his mouth. “ This
settles the souvenir habit for me.”
There were responsive murmurs of
“ me too," while the nervous woman
added the final touch to the situation by
seizing her husband’s coat-.sleeve frantic-
ally and saying, in a stage-whisper:

  “ That horrid man said he would see
us again, later. Do you suppose he is
going to our house ? ”

  Consternation spread itself thickly
over the assemblage. There was a sud-
den scurrying for coats and wraps, and
hurried and excited apologies to host
and hostess.

  “ Really, we must be at home in case
that awful man does come. He’ll simply
turn the house upside down if we are
not there. And think of the servants.
Oh, dear, dear, what a scandal.”

  Within ten minutes the last guest had
departed and Jones sat down among
the deserted card-tables and gave full
license to his pent-up merriment. He
laughed loudly and he laughed long
while Mrs. Jones restrained threatening
tears in amazement.

  “ Richard,” she cried. “ what can you
find to laugh at in this terrible situa-
tion? ”

  “ It's all right, my dear [another joy-
ous outburst] it’s all right. T did it. I
said I would and I did. You know what
they say about me in the street | another
merry intermission] when Jones says he
will do anything, why, it's just as good
as done.”

  “ I don’t understand you. Richard.
You did it? You did what?"

  “ Yes, I did it. Cahill and I fixed
it up between us—Sergeant Cahill, you
know him—the one I got promoted.”

  “ And do you mean to tell me, Rich-
ard Jones, that this—this was all a
farce?” demanded Mrs. Jones angrily.

  *' Yep,” replied Jones jauntily. “ I
shall go down to the station house to-
morrow. get our things and send the
‘ soovies' back where they belong.”

  Jones touched himself off again and
was about to explode when a danger
signal in his wife’s voice caused him to
snuff out the fuse.

  “ And do you mean to say, Mr. Jones,
that that awful creature is going to con-
tinue this little play of yours at the
houses of mv friends?”
764

THE AI.L-STORV MAGAZINE.

  “ Dunno—hope so. Doesn't he act
the tough policeman well? That was
a little thought of mine. In fact the
whole scheme was mine. Clever, wasn’t
it?” Careless of the consequences and
ignoring the icy stare in the eyes of Mrs.
Jones he went off again into a burst of
laughter.

  The front door-bell rang again. Jones
glanced at his watch. It was quarter
past ten. Probably one of the guests in
his hasty departure had forgotten some-
thing. He opened the door himself. A
heavily built man with a slouch hat
pulled over his eyes stood on the stoop.
In many ways he resembled the previous
caller and when he spoke the likeness
was strongly emphasized.

  “Does Jones live here?” he asked
huskily, and in the dim light from the
hall Jones could see him wink.

  " Step right in,” said Jones in amaze-
ment, mechanically returning the wink.
“ Is Cahill going to send up the whole
station house?"

  “Whole station house? What do you
mean, Mr. Jones? You. of course, know
what I am here for.”

  The new-comer had dropped his gruff
tone.

  “ But Gallagher was here not half an
hour ago and carried off the stuff.”

  “ Gallagher? ”

  “ One of your detectives.”

  “ But we haven't any Gallagher on
the staff."

  “ Eh, no Gallagher? Big man, looks
something like you and wears a slouch
hat same as you do, pulled down over
his eyes.”

  “ Not in our precinct.”

  “ Would Cahill have selected a man
from another precinct?”

  “ As this job is a joke, in which he is
lending you the services of the police
department. I don’t think he would take
that chance. And if he had, why should
he send me? This is not a little practical
joke of yours. Mr. Jones?” the detective
added suspiciously.

  “ No. no,” cried Jones excitedly.
“ This is getting away beyond the mer-
ry stage. Can 1 get Cahill on the tele-
phone? ”

  “ You can't, but I can. Where is your
'phone? ”

  “ Right down the hall,” and Jones

led the way in a wild dash for the in-
strument. The detective, after going
through a mysterious formula, succeeded
in getting the connection with the station
house.

  “ Is that you. Sergeant? This is
Morrison. I’m at Mr. Jones's house.
Hold the wire, he wants to speak to you.
Here you are, sir,” and Morrison handed
the receiver to the excited Jones, who
opened up his batteries without delay.
This is what Morrison heard of the
conversation:

  “ That you, Cahill?

  " Got any more detectives on the way
to my house?

  “What do I mean? Yes, I know I
am excited.

  “ Get down to facts? That’s what
I am doing. You sent up Gallagher,
who plays his part very successfully and
carries off the stuff. Then Morrison
appears. Is this a joke?

  “Who’s Gallagher? That’s what I
want to know. Who is Gallagher?

  “Only sent Morrison? Then who in
—who sent Gallagher?

  “ No, never mentioned it to a soul.

  “ N - o, don’t recollect seeing any
one. Oh, yes, come to think of it, sev-
eral minutes after you left me and while
1 was waiting for a car, a man left the
hallway of the building in front of which
we were talking.

  “ Couldn’t tell you how he looked.

  “ Oh, Gallagher? Well, there wasn't
much distinctive about him. Rather a
tough-looking citizen, but that was in
line with our plans. Oh, yes, there was
something I noticed. He had a small
mole on the end of his nose-

  “ What’s that? Don't swear, Cahill—
they will cut us off.

  “ Police wire? Oh, all right.

  “What's that? I’ve been robbed?
Gallagher was ‘ Slick William,’ and he
was the man in the hall ? Oh, Lord! Oh,
Lord! ”

  “ Morrison." said Jones, in a low and
pleading tone as he turned away from
the telephone, “ there’s a hundred dollars
in it for you if you can get that stuff
back before Mrs. Jones finds out what
a fool I am."

  “ Mrs. Jones knows already,” came a
steely voice from the darkness of the
parlor.

The Last

50 cents

in the

World

    A lady in the enthusiasm of regained health and old-time joy, writes:

    44 If I had only 50 cents left in the world, Pll tell you how I would
invest it: Postum, 25 cents; Grape-Nuts, 15 cents; cream, JO cents, and
I'd live like a queen while it lasted.

    ‘ ‘ Postum has done more for me in building up my health and strength-
ening my nerves than all the medicines I’ve taken in the45 years of my life.

     “I suffered about 20 years of that time with nervous sick-headache
often spending 3 days of each week in bed. If I went out one day, I’d
likely spend the next in bed—so nervous, life was not altogether happy as
one can imagine.

     “Seven years ago I left off coffee and commenced drinking Postum
Food Coffee. My strength quickly returned and nervousness and head-
aches became a thing of the past.

     “If anyone tells me they don’t like Postum, I nearly always find
they have not boiled it long enough, for it is surely the ideal drink when
made right, and is full of wholesome goodness.’’

Give Me a Pompeian Massage

          The next time you get into the barber’s chair, take a good look
     at your face in the mirror. Then tell the barber to give you a
     massage with Pompeian Massage Cream after your.shave. You will
     be surprised at the “new face" you will have when you get out of
     the chair. The Pompeian Massage Cream will take out the wrinkles
     and the drawn ‘‘old man” expression that comes from long concen-
     tration in business and sport. It will remove blackheads and the sal-

Pompeian Massage Cream

Hammer the Hammer

      But this is only part of the Iver Johnson story, the biggest part is that
 which the revolver tells best itself—high quality of material and workman-
 ship in every detail, faithful and sure discharge, straight, hard shooting,
 beauty and graceful design. Compactness of structure, easy to handle—
 just the weapon for a gentleman's pocket, bureau, or desk. It may be
 purchased for home use without fear—the ladies of the home find in it a real protection
 against intrusion and have no fear of accidental discharge with it “about the house.”

The lines of The Stetson Shoe are
refined and graceful in design and
do not deviate from the natural
curves of comfort.

   The Stetson Shoe retains this
dignity of character and symmetry
of outline throughout its life, because
the foot is not struggling to break
down the restraining walls
of an improperly
made shoe.

from strains and
from within, but with-
wear and tear from with-
out, because it is made from the highest quality
of materials obtainable and constructed with
the utmost perfection of detail. The merest

 Well he's been .pleased with Gillette blades of
 prev ious years. And we'want e\<ery non-

   ‘vi“l -

  of a truer and keener- shaving edge than
  they've tver known in a strop razor.

  It's noi o new model but a new make.

I	,

   It is the result of two years’ continuous and
   cosfly research by able steel metallurgists.

   . It is-tof the finest iron and the iron is
   convertptl into steel according to a new high .
   carbon Gillette fonnula by .the. most skillful
   steel makers in'.he steel bu.tfness. The lay-
   man will more readily understand the fine-
   ness of this new blade steel when it is ex-
   plained that it cost^ 9 limes the price paid
   for strop razor steel.

 and distributes the .'hardness and ■

 brittleness is due‘partially to the
 paper thinness of the blade
 (6/1000lhs of an inch), as the
 thinner the blade the harder it can
 be tempered. This paper thin blade
 is an exclusive Gillette patent found
 in no othef razor.
