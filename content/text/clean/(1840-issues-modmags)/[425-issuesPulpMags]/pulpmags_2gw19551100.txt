doorway and reflecting dazzlingly off
t-he wear-polished floor planking.
  “He’s not a bad looking kid,” Merry
Mason said to the sheriff. "Neither
way, in appearance nor character.
He's got that same lean face his dad
had, I mean, and a good strong body.
And if you didn’t know him and saw
him on the street, you’d never say
there was a wild one.”
  Sheriff Barton Keller didn’t take
his gaze out of the street. He shifted
the toothpick with his tongue from
one corner of his mouth to the other,
and his pale left eye went wall-eyed
in a peculiar way it had. It was almost
as dark as night in here in the store,
or so it looked to you after you’d
glanced into the mid-morning Au-
gust-sun-blasted, extra-wide, dust-
moted main street.
  “Don’t matter how they look, it’s
what they do,” Keller said indif-
ferently in his always almost in-
audible voice.
  “Oh, of course. But it’s funny, isn't
it.” Standing behind the counter,
Mason wiped the palm of one
wrinkled hand once across the sur-
face of it.
  “He shouldn’t 've got mixed up
with the Naren boys,” Keller said
after a silence.
  “No, I know.” Merry Mason sucked
a deep, quick sigh. “It's too bad for
his mother. She’s a fine woman.”
“Alby Foster was a good man.”
 “I know, I know. Fine parents—
and they turn out like that. What
happens to them?”
  Sheriff Barton Keller shrugged,
the toothpick shifting again as his
gaze came back into the store. “Hey,
I need a sack of Durham,” he said.
He screwed up his face working with
his thick fingers at the string of the
tobacco. “They’re sayin’ Charlie
Landry is headin’ this way.”
 “Charlie Landry?” The elderly
storekeeper’s ears were tuned to the
sheriff’s indolent voice but he re-
peated interesting items in his own
lively accents as a means of confirm-
ing that he'd heard right. “What
would he be wanting here?”
  “What does he ever want.” Keller
tugged the Durham bag shut again
with his teeth. “Another notch on his
gun.”
 “But who in this town would he
consider ‘a notch’? Certainly Fern
Noren’s boasting about his gun-skill
hasn’t won the attention of so em-
inent a one as Charlie Landry.”
Sheriff Barton Keller squinted his
eyes up pulling a long inhale on his
cigarette.
  "Maybe he's just ridin’ through.”
He said finally.
  “Well, let’s hope so,” Merry Mason
said.
' I 'HIS WAS not just an ordinarily
pretty girl. Janice Wells was
chewing in anger the inside of her
lower lip but even the distortion this
brought could not take from the
flawless perfection, for example, of
her soft red cupid’s-bow mouth. She
was not amused, was the trouble, at
sight of Dick Foster drawing a bead
on a tincan he'd placed on the Wells’
corral fence.
  “What I'd like to know,” Janice
was saying, “is what in heaven’s name
has got into you lately. Every time
you come over here you have a new
gun with you. I’m telling you, Daddy
doesn't like it. Nor, what’s more to
the point, do I.”
  The .30-30 crashed and the tincan
took a trip. Dick Foster squinted
sourly.
  "This was my old man's gun,” he
said, giving no sign of considera-
tion of Janice’s speech, pulling his
horse to him and dumping the Win-
chester back in the saddle scabbard.
He hiked up his extra-wide cartridge
belt, joulled askew by the weight of
the big holstered .45, and met her
furious regard squarely. “It’s not
much good.”
  “How very interesting.”
  “What’s the matter, aren’t you in-
terested in guns?” he said after a
minute.
  She put little fists at her slender
waist and her creamy-tanned elbows
jutted.
  “If you knew how silly you looked,
with all those guns hanging all over
you—! Honestly!”
  “You didn’t say I looked silly last
night.” His tone remained flat, hi-s
delivery delayed.
  “Last night I liked you. And I
kissed you. Today I wouldn’t kiss
you for the world.”
  Dick Foster cracked his face with
a broad grin.

  “I’ll bet you would.”
  Janice Wells lowered her head and
her shoulder-length, shiny dark hair
fell in a curtain. Dick Foster looked
at it and his eye dropped to her bare
ankles and he suddenly took her in
his arms and he kissed her at length
when she threw her hair back and put
her face up. A moment before she
was the responsible woman that she
was on the threshold, at eighteen, of
becoming; now she was the teen-age
girl again swept by puppy love.
  “Hey,” she pushed free finally and
murmured huskily, "you shouldn't
do that out here in broad daylight.”
She cleared her throat.
  “I shouldn’t, eh,” he said in a voice
that was no less husky.
  “No you shouldn’t.”
 Janice, no more than Dick, had
noticed her father coming from the
house. Neither of them heard him
even when he was upon them. So
that it was like a bolt of lightning
when he smashed a big hand down on
Dick’s shoulder, spun him, and
slapped his other hand full-open and
hard across Dick’s mouth.
  “I've had enough of your antics,
young man,” George Wells said in a
voice that was as terrible as it was
soft. "Now you get on your horse
and ride out of here and don’t come
back until you’ve learned some man-
ners.”
  Dick Foster ran the tip of his
tongue across his bleeding lower lip,
and the tongue and lip trembled. He
kept his eyes fastened on George
Wells for what began to look like a
foolishly long time, for Janice’s fa-
ther had turned to her, saying, “You’d
better get on up to the house, Jan-
ice.”
 She was watching Dick Foster
worriedly, and she in her turn
couldn't seem to pull her eyes from
him, not even when her fatner took
her arm to start her.
  “I’ll kill you for that, Mr. Wells,”
Dick Foster said very quietly.
  “That’s the kind of remark I’d ex-
pect from you,” George Wells said.
“That’s a highly intelligent state-
ment. Let’s go, Janice.”
  “Oh Dad you shouldn't have done
that—” she moaned.
SITTING HIS staring-tired lath-
ered horse, Charlie Landry raised
his face to the Bky and sniffed the
air. Then he screwed up his face
sourly. It meant nothing in partic-
ular. Charlie Landry was a tough,
merciless, conceited young man, and
he was full of such mannerisms. They
grew out of his restless self-suf-
ficiency; they were the sick flower
of the insatiable craving that crawled
him, to show off.
  Charlie Landry had done a lot of
showing off in the two blazing years
since, a lad of seventeen, he’d risked
drawing with a notorious notch-hunt-
er and bested the fellow. The element
of surprise had done it here, and his
victory had been neat and easy. There
had been shoot-outs since that had
been neither neat nor easy. Death
had taken a couple healthy swipes at
Charlie Landry but without touching
him, and his confidence had swelled
with each new cut on his glossy gun-
butt, until he was hard now to beat.
Nervousness no longer stiffened his
fingers, as it more and more did
those of the ambitious hellions who
had their try at him.
  Charlie Landry was a legend and
he knew it. At nineteen. A kid of
nineteen is not able to carry fame too
gracefully.
  Here on the edge of the vast un-
known hell that was the northern
half of Texas, Charlie Landry made
his arrogant decision. Murder, in the
course of a bank robbery, was among
his achievements now, and with a
virtual Ranger army on his backtrail,
he might wisely have risked the
danger and drought of the High
Plains, where warlike Indians ruled
and what little brackish water was to
be found was undrinkable. For even
the Rangers never went beyond this
point, obviously figuring that an out-
law chased north of here was a dead
outlaw anyway.
  But such drab practicality did not
appeal to Charlie Landry. The hell
with laying low for a few weeks,
with Indians breathing down his
neck and nothing to eat and alkali
salts flavoring his water. What the
hell, he could probably take on a
dozen Rangers in a stand-in-the-street
showdown. Charlie cracked a match
into flame with his thumbnail to punc-
tuate this decision, tilted his head
and pulled his mouth up askew put-
ting match to quirley.

  Then, wearing a sour, wholly self-
satisfied little smile, ho yanked his
palomino's head around and contin-
ued west, ignoring the animal's weary
blowing...
«t_TE’S THE BOY I’d like to put
  1 A it on,” Fern Noren said. Even
standing with his feet set wide apart.
Fern Noren was a full six-feet-five,
a beanpole of a young man, and his
head had the same long slender loo!:
as his body. His two kid brothers,
hunkered on the other side of the
campfire, had the same typical Noren
face, narrow, fishy-eyed, under curly
blond hair.
  “What the hell’s he headed this
way for?” Hunk Noren growled.
  Posy Noren wrinkled his eyes in a
snaggle-toothed grin up at the eldest
brother.
  “He's after old Fern.”
  Fern Noren’s little eyes flickered
in the firelight and he sawed a long
forefinger under his nose self-con-
sciously.
  “Wish to hell he was.”
  “What the hell’s got your lip but-
toned, Foster?” Hunk Noren abruptly
flung over a shoulder at Dick, who
was sitting on a small boulder back
a way from the fire, staring steadily
at it.
  “Just not feeling talkative, that's
all.”
  “He jest ain't feelin’ ‘talkative/
Where you get that high-falutin’ gab,
Foster—from that Wells gal?”
  “She’s got him wore out,” Posy
said.
  “The hell with it,” Dick Foster
said.
  “Tough tonight.”
  “He's tough every night, ain’t you,
Dicky boy?” Posy grinned.
  “Maybe he’s the one ought to take
on Charlie Landry,” Fern Noren said
without humor, glaring at Dick Fost-
er; Fern considered himself top man
in this bunch, and his pigheaded
brain inflamed quickly and easily.
  Posy Noren wasn’t any better en-
dowed with gray matter than Fern,
but he seemed to be because he
grinned and joked a lot. Hunk was
between his brothers in age and
temperament.
  “Yeah, Foster, how ’bout that?”
Hunk said past a toothpick he was
maneuvering.
  “Hey, I thought we come out here
to talk about slow-elkin’ some of that
nice fat Star Ranch beef,” Posy
Noren said.
  Fern Noren sawed the long fore-
finger under the limp nose again.
  “Mebbe we oughta wait until Laun-
dry’s took care of,” he said.
  Hunk squinted at him. “What're
you say in’, Fern?”
 “What's it sound like,” Fern
snapped.
  “You thinkin' of bracin’ Charlie
Landry?”
  “Why the hell not?” Fern growled.
Posy grinned at him, a big wide
grin. “No kiddin’, Fern boy?”
 Five minutes later Hunk Noren
shoved up and said, “Well, he ain’t
cornin’ out here lookin’ for us, let’s
get the hell into town. You ridin’
with us, Foster?”
  Dick said, “Why the hell not?”
  Posy was still wearing the big grin
unhobbling the horses. “Dick boy’s
thinkin’ he might be takin’ a crack
at Charlie Landry himself, ain’t you, .
Dicky boy?”
  Ed Spooner had been Alby Foster’s
one hired hand while Alby was alive.
A lanky bachelor who you couldn’t
rightly estimate was he forty or
seventy, he had that ageless dried-up
kind of skin and wiry build that
never tell of the passage of time—
Ed Spooner had stayed on when
pneumonia took Alby the past winter.
 “I can’t pay you, Ed,” Martha
Foster had said frankly to him.
  “You’re payin’ me,” Ed said. “I’m
eatin’ reg’lar and I got a roof over
my head.”
  What neither of them had said was
that with Spooner’s help, Dick Foster
could have kept the little -spread
operating as well as his dad had, the
boy was old enough now...
THIS NIGHT, though, Ed Spooner
did finally mention Dick. Spooner
had kept his fingers crossed; he fig-
ured every lad worth his salt sowed a
few wild oats before he put his shoul-
der to life’s day-in-day-out grind; he
figured that if Dick didn't get killed
first or saddled with a sizeable prison
sentence, he'd turn out all right.
 This night Ed Spooner spoke to
Dick's mother about him because this
day Spooner had heard that Charlie
THE WILD TIME
9
Landry was in the neighborhood.
  "At first they were sayin’ in town
that he was just ridin’ this way and
would like as not ride right on
through,” Spooner told Martha Fos-
ter. “But now they say the Rangers
are combin’ this section for Landry,
and that he's apt to hole-up in town
for a spell. That’s what they do when
it gets hot: there’s places to hide in
a town, they can get food and liquor,
they can fort up if necessary, they
can take hostages.
  "So what I meant was—if we could
somehow keep Dick out of town for
a few days—it might be a good idea.
These young-uns get ideas. When
they first get handy with a gun, they
figure they can take on Jesse James.”
Martha Foster dropped her sewing
in her lap, and she put tired eyes on
Spooner, the glow from the table
lamp deepening the circles under
them.
  “He’s his own boss now, Ed,” she
said softly. “He would never stay
away from town if I asked him to.
And he won’t take the work serious-
ly-”
  "He ain’t a bad boy, Mrs. Foster.
He ain’t nearly as disrespectful as
you think. Young-uns act that way
at his age, them with any get-up-and-
go in them, especially. You wait;
Dick’ll be all right.”
  “If some Charlie Landry doesn't
kill him first.”
  Ed Spooner came up from taking
a long sip of coffee from his saucer,
into which he always ceremoniously
emptied his cup, with his head on
one side.
  "That's what we got to keep from
happenin’,” he said. “So what I fig-
ured. Mrs. Foster, you’ll have to play-
act like you’re sick.” Spooner’s eyes
went as round as his saucer with the
daring of this unaccustomed conniv-
ance, waiting for her reaction.
  But Martha Foster shook her head.
“I doubt if even that would keep
Dick here, Ed. I—I'm not sure that
he really—loves me any more—”
“Sure he does. He just acts like he
don't, like I told you. Deep-down he
loves you same as ever, you’ll see...
So what I figured was—I’d ride into
town and see if I can find him, and
while I’m gone you hop into bed with
a hot compress on your head.” Spoon-
er's eyes went still wider with this
imaginative scheming. "Yeah.”
  Martha Foster had to laugh at that.
Then she shook her head and her eyes
were moist when she said, “You’re
very sweet, Ed, and I’ll never forget
your—”
  “I ain’t sweet. I just want to keep
young Dick in one piece, so’s when
he gets over his growin’ pains he can
take up where his daddy left off. So’s
I can start gettin’ my pay reg’lar
again,” he added with a twinkle in
his eye.
UnrHAT ANIMAL could stand
-I- some attention, son,” the white-
haired hostler finally made himself
say to Charlie Landry.
  Like everybody else in town, he’d
been frozen into slow-motion ever
since the word had flashed about an
hour past sunset that the notorious
young killer was riding in, but no
man who loved horseflesh could have
stood to look very long at Landry’s
beaten mount and not spoken up in
its defense.
  Sitting the shiny sweat-wet palo-
mino indifferently where he’d let it
come to a stop halfway along the
main street, Charlie Landry put his
gaze on the aged liveryman, while
the town waited breathless.
  Landry said, as though he hadn’t
heard the hostler’s words, “What’s
the town all lit up for, old man?”
The street was indeed, for a Tues-
day night, inordinately illuminated,
with the swaths of yellow light that
extended from the saloon, the em-
porium, the hotel, the livery, the law
office, the restaurant, blended by a
full moon into an effect almost re-
sembling daylight. Not, of course,
actually like daylight; rather like a
stage-set denoting it, with a tension
about it such as one feels in the weird
glow that precedes a tornado.
  *It ain’t lit up ’specially,” the
liveryman said.
  “What’s it, lit up for me or for the
Rangers?”
  The liveryman frowned, “What
Rangers?”
  "The Rangers that are on my tail.
Fifteen of ’em. Big, tough Texas
Rangers. I sat that hill you got out
there and I watched ’em cornin’. May-
10
2-GUN WESTERN
be there’s only ten of them, but it
looked more like fifteen. What do
you think of that, old man?”
  The street was as quiet as if there
weren’t a soul up and down its
length, so that Charlie Landry's
voice rang out clear and sharp, like
how a voice sounds on a still, cold
night. Seeing Sheriff Barton Keller
standing between the law office and
the store, and the Noren boys and
Dick Foster on the saloon veranda,
and Ed Spooner beside his horse
where he’d stepped down at the res-
taurant hitchrack, you would have
done a double-take on them, for you
wouldn't have believed that so many
people could be there without any
of them making any kind of a sound.
  “I said what do you think of that,
old man?”
  The liveryman muttered grudging-
ly, "I don't think nothing of it.”
“Well, maybe you’ll think some-
thing of it when I fort up in your
stinking stable and shoot it out with
all them big, tough Rangers. Because
right now that’s what I’m thinking
of doing, old man. And then not only
my horse but all your horses too
would get my attention, because like
as not I’d fort right up behind them.
  “Because them big, tough Rangers
wouldn’t want to mow down all them
pretty ponies to get at me, and that
way I could be mowing the Ranger
boys down instead while they made
up their minds.”
  Then Charlie Landry put his pale
eyes on the group on the saloon
porch. He might have been a good-
looking kid except for those color-
less eyes, though it was hard to tell
any more whether their cold, dead
look was a result of a lack of pig-
mentation or lack of any shred of
warmth behind them.
  It was difficult, in fact, to note
much less remember any other detail
of Charlie Landry’s face than his
eyes. They were him; they and the
lightning-fast gunhand. They seemed
to get bigger if you could stand to
look straight into them, until they
fascinated you, hypnotized you. Even
Landry’s flashy attire, even the
jewel-studded black flat-crowned
stetson, and the purple silk shirt
with fancy white embroidery on one
of the two breast pockets, did not
make the impression on you that the
eyes did.
  “Who are the quiet little boys
lined up on the veranda there?”
Charlie Landry said. Then one of
his .45’s was suddenly glinting in his
right hand and he was blistering the
saloon with bullets, so that the Noren
boys and Dick Foster had all they
could do to dive onto the planking
in time to escape the fusillade.
  “They're yellow little boys, I see,”
Charlie Landry said, deliberately
reloading his gun. “Which is the
sheriff?” he said a moment later.
"You, fella?” he addressed Barton
Keller.
  The lawman stood as though fro-
zen, his eyes wide on Landry, his
hands flat on his belly, moving un-
comfortably, as though he didn’t
know what to do with them.
  “Hey, here come them Rangers,
old man,” said amiably then to the
hostler, for the gentle thud of hoofs
had begun to sound on the still night
air. “Dry night like tonight, sound
ain’t carryin’ far, so they'll be cornin’
in right quick, right, old man?”
THE HOSTLER, having been
standing stiff, suddenly grabbed a
shotgun from behind a doorpost and
was squeezing the triggers before he
had the weapon lined. This was why
he had little success, but it was at
the same time the only reason he had
any success at all. Charlie Landry
had expected such a move, but Char-
lie Landry didn’t blow the top of an
old man’s head off in a hurried man-
ner. There were times you needed to
be fast; putting it on an old man was
not one of them. That was how-come
Charlie Landry’s left arm got
brushed by the shotgun blast. He’d
timed his draw for a split-second
later.
  “Damn you!” he snarled, feeling
the slugs rip his arm, the first taste
Charlie Landry had ever had of hot
lead, and in unleashed fury he emp-
tied his gun into the already dead
body, from which life had been torn
by his first bullet.
  Sheriff Barton Keller went for his
gun then, stepping out onto the
boardwalk, but the Rangers were
sweeping into town in this same
moment, and Charlie Landry had
THE WILD TIME

wheeled his horses viciously and
swung off and into the cover of the
livery. He ripped off his left sleeve
and when he saw all the bleeding
holes he swore violently again and
slammed his empty gun at the crum-
pled form of the hostler.
  Then Charlie Landry's bloodshot
pale eyes flicked wildly in the direc-
tion of the Rangers, who were step-
ping down in front of the livery with
drawn guns amid the yelling and
pointing of townsmen, and Charlie
Landry palmed his left-side gun and,
as promised, started yanking the
horses out of their stalls so that they
became a multi-layered barricade
between him and the Rangers.
  The horses remained an adjunct to
Charlie Landry’s stand but briefly,
however, Landry's near-hysteria evi-
dently spread to the animals, and as
the excitement outside rose as well,
they started moving. One, in fact,
suddenly reared, and one of its paw-
ing hooves caught Landry's already
tortured left shoulder. Charlie Lan-
dry's profanity was purple at this
and he wasted another bullet by
smashing it at the horse's head.
  Which only served to compound
his difficulties, because the animal
screamed before it died, and the other
horses really started getting out of
hand then.
  The bullets, indeed, that the light-
ning-fast young gunman used on the
old liveryman and the horses became,
ironically, the only effective ones he
got in during this his greatest show-
down. For the stampeding horses
caused him to have to abandon shoot-
ing at the Rangers in the street, sent
him desperately to the rear door o£
the stable.
  And by the time he got the door
yanked open, four Rangers had sped
back there between the livery and the
next building, and were waiting with
lined and levered sixguns and .30-30s’.
So that Charlie Landry was literally
blown to hell before his fabulous
trigger-finger could react even in-
stinctively. ...
SOMETIMES Ed Spooner not only
put his head on one side when he
poured his coffee from his cup into
his saucer, but also arched the little
finger of his pouring hand. He did
this on very special occasions. He did
it this morning at breakfast with Mrs.
Foster and Dick. Spooner had had,
after all, to do all the talking. MrS.
Foster was obviously too nervous to
talk. And Dick had simply eaten his
bacon and eggs in silence.
  Dick did, though, answer the re-
marks Ed Spooner addressed to him
(with each of which Mrs. Foster be-
came more and more worried) and his
answers were notable.
  ‘‘Man, them Rangers really give it
to him, didn’t they though, Dick?”
“They did, yes...”
 “Funny. Charlie Landry. The
toughest of them all. I don’t reckon
there ever was a kid slicker with a
gun than him, do you reckon, Dick?”
“No, I doubt if there ever was.”
“An’ they lay him out jest as neat
as a pin.”
  “I know.”. ..
  “You got to be low to shoot down
an old man, an’ treat a horse like he
done, you know it?”
  “You sure do.”. ..
  What Dick Foster replied to Janice
Wells was well worth mention too,
when she swept into the dooryard
and slid off her horse and said breath-
lessly at once to Dick,
  “I know Daddy will be furious but
I had to see you and see how you
were. I heard that—that Charlie
Landry shot at you before they—”
“He shot at me, all right,” Dick
said with a weary little grin. “And
what I did was dive for the floor with
my heart in my mouth.”
  “Oh. But you weren’t—”
  “No, I wasn’t hit. Look, Janice, I’ll
ride back with you, because I want to
apologize to your father. And on the
way I think I could do a little
apologizing to you too.”...
  Standing in the bright sunshine in
the doorway beside Ed Spooner,
watching Dick and Janice ride out,
Mrs. Foster suddenly put a hand to
Ed's arm for support, because her
knees were shaking so she thought
they might give way on her. It was
possibly a let-down from all the ter-
rible tension, but more likely it was
a reaction to Dick’s having kissed
her before he swung up on his
horse...	(END

noon, a tall man whose angular
face bore the weather-honed
mark of long years a-saddle, yet whose
brown eyes were kindly. In all Ari-

Rio Gato. And midway in the tumbled
hills stood an adobe hut: the house of
his friend Emanuel Rodriguez.
  Dorn smiled and prodded his reluc-
tant mare along the trail. It was a
year now since he’d seen Rodri-
guez. ..
  When he swung down in the yard
Dorn found the Mexican waiting to
greet him. Rodriguez has aged, the
preacher thought when they shook
hands; his round face, though smil-
ing, looked tired and careworn. “I
dig no longer for the silver,” the old
man said presently, as they sat remi-
niscing. "Maybe soon I go back to
Sonora.’’
  “And leave the mine?”
  Rodriguez nodded, “It is sad, Se-
nor.” His eyes swung wistfully to-
ward the dark opening in an outcrop
of rock yonder.
  Dorn was silent, thinking he’d miss
this old man beside him. Rodriguez
had no greed for the silver he took
from the earth. But he loved the dig-
ging... Dorn reached for his pocket.
“Perhaps a small stake, enough so’s
a man could keep going—”
  Warmth kindled in the Mexican’s
eyes. “It is not money I need, Senor,”
He looked down at his gnarled brown
hands, raised them painfully, “A man
cannot dig with his hands full of mis-
ery. It is the water in the tunnel—al-
ways water. I can do nothing about
it."
  Watching the old man as he pre-
pared a meal of frijoles. the Preacher
couldn’t help noticing the pain on his
face, the halting motions of his hands.
Dorn decided then that when he got
to Junction at the head of the valley,
he'd have a talk with Doc Weather-
stone and see what the medico could
do for Rodriguez....
  An hour later, reining in beside the
Rio Gato, the preacher sat his horse
and stared at the river's sun-baked
mud. "Dry,’’ he muttered, wondering-
ly. In all his years meandering up and
down the Territory, he couldn’t re-
call when mountain water hadn't kept
the Rio Gato full and running. It was
a thing he’d taken for granted.
  Dorft wheeled his horse and jogged
up-river, reflecting on the will of
God. Rodriguez giving up his mine
because it flooded with water—while
here the Rio Gato ran dry and ranch-
ers in the valley faced ruin. Which-
ever way a man rode, there was trou-
ble.
  He prodded the mare to a faster
pace along the trail. This trouble was
man-made, it occurred to him now.
His eyes scanned the burned river
bottom; there'd been enough rain in
the hills, according to Rodriguez.
Then, coming to a clearing, he saw
the wall of rough-hewn timbers
stretching soVidly from bank to bank,
and beyond, the flash of sun-lit wat-
er. So the Rio Gato had been damned,
as he suspected.
  He went on past the clearing. Here
backwater from the dam had risen
flooding the trail; he took to the
brush, and rode around it. It was a
short time later as the mare rounded
a bend in the river, that Dorn, peer-
ing ahead, saw the woman standing in
front of the cabin.
  In her hands she held a rifle, but
as he came close, she put it down. The
preacher tufned into the yard and
reining up, said softly, “You won’t
need that Winchester, Ma’am. Surely
you remember the riding minister.”
 “Dorn.” The woman was young
when she smiled. “It’s been quite a
while since you came this way,
Preacher.”
  Dorn looked down at her. She was
straight-backed and slender in a ging-
ham dress, her chestnut hair drawn to
the nape of her neck, glinting golden
in the sunlight. But it was the fine,
wide set of her face, the preacher re-
flected, that would make any man re-
member. .. “Sorry to hear about your
husband,” he said presently. “Johan-
son was a good man, and God-loving.”
  The woman's glance swept the un-
finished cabin, the bare yard with its
line of broken fencing. “John did
what he could to build a homestead.
It'd take a gunslick to hold out
against Miles Gruber, once he start-
ed land-grabbing.”
  Dorn eyed the Winchester. “Is that
why you’re holding the rifle?” he
asked.
  “This place stands in the way of
Miles' plans for his diversion dam,”
the widow said bitterly. “Does that
answer your question?”
14
2-GUN WESTERN
  “So it was Gruber dammed the riv-
er,” the preacher frowned. He peered
yonder at the hollow slope of the
hills, and remembering the backwater
on the trail, said, “Now he wants your
land, to flood with backwater.”
 The widow nodded. “My husband
died in the brush with a bullet in his
back, over a year ago. Miles has come
here ever since, offering to buy the
place—” She smiled, “He even offered
to marry me. Gruber doesn’t know
what love is,” she said, coloring. Late-
ly, he’s started threatening me—”
Hoof-tromp sounded in the yard, and
she added, morosely, “Here he is
now.”
  Dorn looked up to see Gruber rid-
ing toward them; he turned to the
widow. “If you don’t mind, Ma’am,
I’ll give the mare some water.” He
swung from saddle.
GRUBER REINED up beside the
widow and swept off his hat with
a flourish. “Fine day.” His shrewd
eyes took in the preacher, “I reckon
it’s generally known I’m courting the
widow, but it’s a little early for you,
Preacher,” he laughed. “What are you
doing here?”
  Dorn said, softly, “It's time you
stopped bothering Mrs. Johanson,
Gruber.”
  Gruber sat the saddle, a big man
and florid, his face grown suddenly
livid with anger. He glanced at the
widow, then back at the man beside
her. “Why, you damned tramp par-
son,” he roared, “I’ll have you run out
of the country!”
  He wheeled his horse dangerously
close to the widow Johanson. “I
didn't expect you’d have company,
Ma'am,” he said angrily. “I’ll be back
tomorrow. One of these days you’ll
think better of my offer.” Spurring
his gelding, he galloped from the
yard.
  The widow stood looking after him.
Despair in her eyes, she turned to
face the preacher. “Gruber means I’ll
sell, or be flooded out,” she said. “The
backwater from his dam is rising. ..”
Dorn let his horse drink from the
pail. He said, mounting, “I’m stop-
ping in Junction, Mrs. Johanson.
There’s a lawman there will take care
of Gruber—”
  The widow laughed bitterly. “Evar
hear of a paper sheriff, Preacher?
This isn’t the only place Gruber it
after. The ranchers have called a
meeting tonight, in Junction..."
Her voice trailed off.
  “I’ll be there,” Dorn looked at th«
woman thoughtfully. “If the sheriff
won’t stop Gruber—”
 The widow touched his arm, and
there was a softness in her eyes as
she looked at him. Dorn had removed
his low-crowned hat, and the brown
hand holding it was strong and gentle.
A good man, like Johanson... She
shook her head. “Keep out of this,
Preacher. Things are worse, below
the dam. Gruber wants the whole val-
ley.”
  There were times, Dorn thought,
when he was tempted to forget the
words in the Good Book. When he
longed to use the six-gun on his hip,
that he carried for rattlesnakes. But
he was a man of God. “Thou shall not
kill...”
  Now, as his mare's hoofs beat a
hollow tattoo across the wooden
bridge at the edge of town, Dorn won-
dered at how things had changed,
since he'd last ridden into Junction.
  Coming up the Rio Gato he’s seen
the results of Gruber’s thrust for
power. Things are worse below the
dam, the widow had said; a land of
starved ranchers, and dead cattle...
Had Gruber taken over the town, as
he had the river?
  Passing Stockman's Hall and the
Mercantile, Dorn was about to swing
down in front of the hotel, when he
remembered the medicine he wanted
for Rodriguez. Tired as he was, he
rode to the far end of town, and
called on Doc Weatherstone.
  The ruddy-faced little medico lis-
tened, then shook his head. “Rheuma-
tism,” he pronounced. “Regardless,
the old man’ll have to stop his dig-
ging.” He sat for a moment, his bright
eyes studying the preacher, whistling
tunelessly. Then he hurried into his
dispensary. Returning, he handed
Dorn a bottle. “According to my
label, it’ll cure anything.” He laughed
as he shook hands with the preacher.
 Riding back down Main street,
Dorn left the tired mare at the livery-
stable. Tomorrow I’ll see what I can

do about the widow, the preacher
thought, as he toted his war bag to-
ward the Star Hotel.
  What with Gruber and trouble in
the valley, it didn’t look like he’d get
much time for preaching, Dorn re-
flected morosely. Somehow the beau-
tiful sermons he thought up while
riding between towns always got lost,
once he reached his destination...
  At the hotel he took a room, and ate
a late supper.
  Darkness shrouded Junction by the
time he started for the rancher’s
meeting at Stockman’s Hall. Dorn
went along the boardwalk past lamp-
lit saloons and storefronts—aware of
an unnatural quiet that pervaded Main
Street.
  Ranch wagons were drawn up, as
though deserted, in front of the Mer-
cantile. A scattering of saddle mounts
stood at hitchracks further down the
street. Somewhere in the shadows a
horse nickered, the soft sound carry-
ing clearly through the night air...
  I can feel it, Dorn thought; the
warnings, near-voiceless, were unmis-
takable. Gruber had stolen the river—
and written his own law in Junction.
But not for long. For Gruber had a
valley of angry men against him. To-
night at Stockman’s Hall, there'd be
trouble. ..
CiTTE’S TOO smart to meet with
  A A us,” a rancher said angrily.
“He knows we’re here for a show-
down.”
  Dorn stood at the rear of Stock-
man’s Hall, his eyes studying the taut
faces of the ranchers as they sat dis-
cussing Gruber. A man with red hair
and a gaunt face got to his feet.
  “What none of you figure,” he said,
thickly, “is that we’ll be too late with
the civil suit we got pending against
Gruber for damming the river. It’ll
take another month of court-wran-
glin’ anyway, and meantime Gruber
can have any spread in the valley. To
hell with talk, my cows are dying.
Let’s blast Gruber, the dirty, land-
grabbing son. We’ll tear down his
dam—”
  “Wait a minute, men," Sheriff Ben-
son spoke from the edge of the circle.
“Any shooting, and you’ll have the
law on your hands."
  A thin smile creased the redhead’s
hard mouth. “You ain’t done nothin’
so far, Sheriff, while Gruber’s been
starving us out of the valley.” Turn-
ing his back, he said to the others,
“Are you riding with me against Gru-
ber, or do I go alone?”
  “I’m with you, Hannigan,” one of
the ranchers said loudly. A growl of
approval rose from the others.
  Dorn moved forward into the lamp-
light. “Gruber has a tough crew be-
hind him,” he said slowly. “Begin,
and there’ll be more than one killing.”
His glance singled out young Johnny
Hackett, standing in shadow. “I sup-
pose you’ll be riding too, Johnny. I
came to Junction expecting to marry
you.” His glance travelled the circle.
“You men should think of your wom-
enfolk, before you start a range war."
  Johnny Hackett spoke up. “You
don't rightly belong here, Preachfy."
he said respectfully. “I ain’t marryin’
Beth—my place is wiped out.” His
voice shook with emotion, “Leave us
alone, we’ll settle with Gruber.”
There was a rumble of agreement
from the ranchers and the meeting
scattered, men pushing past the
preacher toward the doorway. "Meet
in front of the hotel before daylight,”
the red-haired man called, “We’ll ride
to Box-G and give Gruber a surprise
party."
THERE WAS nothing he could do,
Dorn thought grimly, as later, he
sat staring from .the window of his
room at the hotel.
  Main Street was still ablaze with
lamplight. A crowd of people stood in
front of the hotel, talking in low tones
of the morning raid on Box-G. Gruber
would be ready; they’re waiting, the
preacher thought, waiting for the kill-
ing to begin.
  He’d placed the lamp on the com-
mode near his chair, and for a time,
tried to read from the Bible. Now the
book lay open on his knees, his fin-
gers riffling absently through its dog-
eared pages.
  By noon tomorrow there’d be hell
along the Rio Gato, and no way he
could stop it, Dorn thought sadly. He
wouldn’t be able to help the Widow
Johanson... You don’t rightly belong
here. Preacher, Johnny Hackett had
16
2-GUN WESTERN
told him; maybe Johnny was right. In
the morning, he’d ride from town.
Down-valley he’d take the medicine to
Rodriguez, and go back over the pass
to Yuma. His fingers moved to close
the Bible.
 A page had come loose and he
looked down, meaning to put it back
in place. Out of habit, he started read-
ing;
 —and thy rod, wherewith thou
smotest the river,
take in thy hand, and go
...The river. The Rio Gato wound
out of the hills above Rodriguez's
place—and Rodriguez’s mine was
flooding with water. Dorn read the
next verse, his heart pounding;
Behold.. .thou shalt smite the rock,
and there shall come water out of it,
that the people may drink. ..
  It was all there, in the Bible!
MINUTES later, Dorn came hurry-
ing out of the Mercantile, a paper
bundle in his arms, and called to John-
ny Hackett, who’d just swung down
in front of the Empire Saloon.
  Johnny led his gelding across Main
Street. “Sorry for what I said at the
meeting, Preacher. That talk about
me and Beth—”
 “You want to marry Beth, don’t
you, Johnny? You’d rather save your
spread than fight Gruber and his out-
fit?”
 “I reckon so,” Johnny eyed the
preacher curiously. “What you got
there, Preacher? Don’t look like
groceries—”
 “Dynamite,” Dorn said, softly.
“Get back on that horse, Johnny.
You’re riding for me tonight, fast—
and careful...”
GRUBER stood massive, his back to
the dam, his feet planted in the
dawn-lit clearing. His crew was
spread out behind him, except for a
few who stood guard on the opposite
bank of the narrow river.
 Box-G’s owner smiled. “I don’t
scare easy,” he said to the ranchers
who sat their horses before him. His
hand hovered above his holster. “You
want to be the first to move, Hanni-
gan?”
  The red-head swore. He turned to
the men beside him. “Keep listening
to the preacher here, and you’ll all
turn yellow.”
  He couldn’t delay any longer, Dorn
was thinking. Maybe he had heard
the explosion, riding down-valley
with the ranchers—but he couldn’t be
sure. He’d been too worried about
Johnny’s ever reaching Rodriguez,
hard-riding with his saddle bsgs
stuffed with dynamite. .. Dorn swung
from saddle and walked toward Gru-
ber.
  "Stop where you are, Preacher,”
Gruber barked. He'd drawn his gun;
his glance flicked over the ranchers,
his will commanding.
  Dorn unbuckled his gun-belt and let
it drop to the ground. “I don't think
you’ll pull the trigger now, Gruber—
that’d be murder.” He went forward
slowly, until he could see the grey
hairs in Gruber’s stubble of beard, the
tiny beads of perspiration that stood
on his forehead, “Besides, there's
something I want to show you.”
  Dorn went to the edge of the dam,
picked up a stick, and thrust it in the
water. With his knife he notched the
stick where it reached the surface. He
turned to Gruber. “The Mexicans call
it Cat River. You know, Gruber, you
never can tell which way a cat’ll
jump...” He swung to face the
ranchers. “Give me five more minutes,
before you start shooting.”
  “Out of the way, Preacher,” Hanni-
gan warned. “We’re not waitin’—”
Time, Dorn thought, minutes, and
he might avert a range war. He turned
again to Gruber, an answer forming as
he spoke. “You thought you had a
river—maybe a whole valley,” he
laughed. “It’s going to be tough Grub-
er, watching your dam go empty.”
Gruber’s solid face worked with
suspicion. “You lie, Preacher. But if
you’ve done anything to that river,
you damned, sneaking—”
  “You wouldn't talk like that with-
out a gun in your hand,” Dorn
taunted. Gruber out-weighed him by
thirty pounds of solid brawn, he was
thinking; Dorn straightened as the
rancher dropped his gun-belt to the
ground. Then Gruber was coming to-
ward him, charging like a maddened
bull, his fists swinging.
  Dorn raised his arms, warding off
the 6avage fury of those first sledge-
"THOU SHALT NOT KILL..."
17
like blows while he waited for an
opening. When it came he swung a
hard right to the side of Gruber's
head; the blow spun Gruber around,
a look of astoniskment on his beefy
face. A growl came from the ranchers,
“Hit him, Preacher,” one of them
yelled lustily.
 Dorn's glance flicked over the
horseman; Hannigan sat unmoving.
They’ll watch while it lasts, the
preacher thought grimly. Suddenly
Gruber rushed him, and this time the
rancher’s driven fist struck with an
impact that resounded in his skull
like thunder. Dorn fell sprawling.
  Gruber was upon him in a second,
his huge fists pounding, battering him
with blows to the head and shoulders.
Dorn struck back, realizing he fought
a losing battle. But he fought for
time. The sky wheeled crazily be-
fore his eyes.
  In desperation, he grasped Gruber
by the arms and, planting a knee in
his belly, heaved upward. Gruber fell
sideways and they grappled, rolling
on the ground near the dam.
  They broke apart and Dorn came up
on one knee, and remained there, try-
ing to clear his vision, when he saw
Gruber coming toward him. The
rancher kicked viciously at his face.
Dorn grabbed the boot and twisted;
Gruber toppled, swearing as he fell.
 Tired, Dorn took the moment to
stagger to his feet. Some of his blows
had told on Gruber, he thought with
satisfaction, as the rancher rose and
came toward him. There was blood
on Gruber’s cheeks, and his eyes had
the look of murder. “I'm going to kill
you, Preacher,” he muttered thickly.
  Dorn stood still, waiting now for
the chance he knew would come—for
Gruber in his rage had become reck-
less. Even as the rancher swung, Dorn
stepped inside the wide arching blow,
and brought up his fist against the
side of Gruber’s head, with a crack
that resounded in the clearing. The
blow knocked the heavy man off-bal-
ance and Gruber was that way, his
head back, his jaw out-thrust—when
the preacher’s last blow hit him.
  Dorn stood for a moment looking
down at Gruber, hearing only dimly
the clamor of voices around him. Then
he walked to the edge of the dam
where he’s left the notched stick.
When he swung to face the ranchers,
there was a slow smile spreading on
the preacher’s face. “You’ve no reason
to fight now,” he said. “Get Gruber
over here and I'll prove it. ..” It was
then that he heard the beat of hoofs,
and turning, saw Johnny Hackett
come pounding into the clearing.
 Johnny swung down from his
lathered gelding and walked ovef to
the sky-pilot. “You should have seen
it, Preacher,” he said, panting. “I
strung that dynamite in the minehead,
like you said. When she blew, me and
old Rodriguez had to run like jack-
rabbits to keep from getting drown-
ded. Why, that there’s the purtiest
little river you ever did see, runnin’
straight into the valley!”...
OLD RODRIGUEZ didn’t really
need the medicine, Dorn reflected
now, as he prodded the reluctant mare
back over the pass toward Yuma.
  When he’d waved good-bye, Rodri-
guez had been bending over his new
vegetable garden beside the river,
happily digging. Working in the sun,
Rodriguez’s gnarled hands had lost
the misery. Dorn chuckled; now that
the old Mexican was something of a
celebrity, he’d changed his plans about
going back to Sonora.
  All in all, Dorn allowed, it had
been a pretty fair trip over. If he
lived to be a hundred, he’d never for-
get the dumfounded expression on
Gruber’s face, while water fell away
from the notched stick—or the look
in the Widow Johanson’s eyes as she
stood in her yard, and saw the back-
water from Gruber’s dam receding.
  A fair trip, what with Beth and
Johnny Hackett’s wedding, and the
way the Widow Johanson had smiled
at him afterwards, when she’d said
goodbye... "Get along, girl,” the
preacher said gruffly. He prodded
the drooping mare.
  A fine woman, the Widow, Dorn
reflected; the kind that would make
some lonely man. downright happy.
Maybe someday soon he’d come back
this way, and just call on the Widow
Johanson, social-like. Maybe some-
day in the spring... .
  The preacher rode on over the
pass.	• END

AS-SIR, BUB, I toted that
thar shootin' arn through
four year of trouble,” the
old man said reminiscently. “I done
looked through them sights at many
a damyank.”
  Long Sam, his boy, leaned on the
musket in question, nodding absently,
for he'd heard ths tale a good many
times. His squinted eyes had caught
a solitary wagon through the cotton-
woods on the far bank of the river.
  “No-sir, that thar ain't no ordinary
musket, bub,” Pappy Dodds went on.
  “Totes a slug the size of a buck-
eye.”
  “You said it. Hit’s rifle air bored
and hit are twelve
inches longer'n the
average.”
  “And if you p’int
it in the right di-
rection and let fly,
it'll knock a Dam-
yank out of a tree
a mile away.”
 “Bub, you know
it by heart. Or a
dam’ Injun.”
 “Wagon edging
in on the fur
bank.”
  “Let ’er edge and
be hanged. I’m a
weary man.”
 “You was born
so, Pappy, though I own you was a
good soldier. They’s hollering for the
ferry.”
  “Let ’em holler. Mebby if we wait
a spell two wagons will come along
and we'll make two dollars instead of
just one.”
  The ferry lay tied to a willow. The
water lapped at its crude sides pleas-
antly. The air was slumbrous. The
sun hung low, round and red through
the afternoon haze and dust. The mule
that operated the treadmill which in
turn navigated the primitive ferry
stirred and stamped to get the horse-
flies off its rump. Except for the
shouting wagoner across the river
there was hardly a sound.
  “Well, Pappy, let's set the boat
over. No need of the feller ripping out
the roots o£ his tongue. Traveling by
hisself, he might be in a hurry.”
  “He’s likely some polecat from that
wagon train we sot over yesterday,
likely got too big for his - britches
and decided he'd go alone. Well, them
Pawnees will make a good angel out
of him.”
  Languidly father and son manned
the ferry. One took one side oar, the
other the other, and the mule began
his grind. They turned the boat and

headed across the
river. At the tran-
quil rate of a mile
in two hours they
arrived at the land-
ing.
 Long Sam in-
spected the offerings. There was a
big lumbering wagon pulled by a
span of fleabitten mules, and a spare
team led behind. A milk cow with dry
bag was attached by a lead-rope. A
tired calf bawled at the cow’s tail.
  The freight on the wagon consisted
of some battered pieces of furniture
rolls of bedding, a large wood box of
provisions, and at the hind end a big
crate with a sow and pigs, the sow be-
ing old and the pigs new. And higher
up, a crate of chickens, mostly two
hens and a rooster and maybe a duck.
And still higher on the load was a big

lumpy old woman ambushed under a
slat bonnet—and what really caught
Long Sam's roving eye, a girl—
  By gums, a gal!
 He couldn’t see much of her,
though, she was so disguised in lye-
faded homespun the general color of
the dusty Western soil. What curves
she might reasonably have had by
virtue of her youth were hopelessly
shrouded in loose calico. And her
young face was barricaded by the
slats of a bonnet twin-cousin to her
ma'r,. She did have a pair of bright
brown eyes, whose curiosity not even
the past weary miles subdued; and
with these she peered down at Long
Sam, while he peered up trying to
find what he had here in all this
shrubbery of old clothes.
  The head man of this outfit was
travel-stained and tobacco juice ran
down the edges of his mouth and dis-
colored his scraggly beard.
  “You been a long enough time get-
ting acrost,” this unmellow creature
growled.
  “Yap,” said Pappy, “I had all the
rest of my life.”
  “I been in a bigger rush than that,”
the man stated.
  Pappy shrugged. “Some as is in a
rush and some as ain’t. I ain’t. Now
me’n the boy air hyar, we’ll sot you
acrost. The usual price is a dollar in
gold. But seeing as you air so bad-tem-
pered about hit, the price air two
dollars.”
  “You are a damn-robber,” said the
man.
“I can tell by your talk you air a
Damyank, and that’s the same thing.”
While this colloquy took place,
Pappy leaned on his sharpshooter’s
rifle, placid and immovable.
  “Before I’ll be held up I’ll stay on
this side!”
 “Shore!” Pappy said. He waved.
“Lots of territory on this side. Red-
skins, too.”
  “By Judas I’ll swim the river!”
“Shore. Ain’t nobody stopping you.
Only they is some sucks out yan, and
treacherous waters, and instead of get-
ting to the fur side you mout just
drift down to hades, which is full of
the likes of ye. A mess of ’em I sont
thar myself with this hyar.” He patted
the gun.
THE EMIGRANT glowered, his
thin blue eyes smouldering with a
soldier’s well-remembered wrath.
  “I reckon I sent some of your
brethern to the same place—at Shiloh,
at Chattanooga, and a few other
spots.”
  “Shiloh? Chattanoogy? I war thar,
neighbor. At Chattanoogy I sot on a
rocky crag and tuck aim with this
hyar,” and he again patted his rifle,
“and shot down at a row of Dam-
yanks and know what? It was like
shootin’ a roost of scrooch-owels off
a dead limb!”
  “Pa,” the girl pleaded in a low but
huskily musical voice, “pay the man
the price and let’s be set across.”
  The old woman put in her mouth.
“You fit the wars enough times now.
Latch your jaw and let’s go where we
aim to go.”
  “Shut up,” the man told his women-
folks. “Who’s skinning this skunk?”
“Whoever is, it’s making a mighty
stink,” the girl said.
  “I'll slap yur teeth down your
throat,” her father stated.
  Long Sam grinned. “Looks like the
Civil War’s fixing to bust out in the
Yankee family.”
  The man glowered, but he seemed
to give in. “I reckon I’ll have to pay
you two dollars.”
  “Cross my palm with gold, mister,”
Pappy held out his hand.
  “I reckon you don’t trust me.”
“Nope. I don't trust Yankees, Paw-
nees, half-breeds, stray dogs and gam-
blers.” He kept his hand extended.
  Reluctantly the traveler reached
into his jeans, extracted a coin ; Pappy
bit down on it to make sure, and nod-
ded for Long Sam to man the broad-
horn. All the while Long Sam and the
girl had been eyeing each other.
  Once the ferry was in motion, the
Northerner inquired, “How's lands out
there?” He waved to the west.
  “Maybe more’n you seen back whur
you come from,” Pappy said.
  “How’s the redskins?
  “You ort to stayed with your wagon
train. Now you may lose your hair.”
Pappy jerked his head toward the
womenfolks. “Some brave will keep
your gal. and they’ll shore take the
hair of that old woman of yourn.”
  “I guess I can take care of my own,”
20
2-GUN WESTERN
the Yankee said. But his voice didn’t
have much assurance in it.
 Pappy shrugged and worked the
oar. Long Sam had a device with
which he manipulated the sweep and
his oar and the mule all at the same
time. The horseflies were terrible.
The traveler's teams stamped and
lashed with their tails. The hot dry
air seemed to swirl in eddies above the
water. The more humid it got the
more one could hardly breathe it. Far
up at the headwaters there had been
heavy rains but none had come this
way, only the dirty swill in the river.
 Long Sam talked between move-
ments of the broadhorn. “What’s your
name ?’’
  “Betty.”
  “What’s his name?” He pointed in
the direction of her father.
  “Sol McMasters.”
 “Where you ones headed, any-
wheres in particular?”
  “Oregon, California—wherever that
is. Pa’s hard-hardheaded, can't make
up his mind. All the time fussing with
people. He’s right good-hearted, but
since the war he ain’t been himself.”
LONG SAM nodded toward the
slowly approaching fringe of wil-
lows. “Good land thar as anywheres.
I ain’t been to the other end of the
world, but far’s I been it looks about
the same. You ones mout settle nigh
about?”
  “Maybe.”
  “How you look without that thar
durn bonnet?”
  She took it off, shook her brown
curls out, and gave him a starry smile.
 “By gum,” Long Sam said, “I’ll
holp talk your old man into settling.
Besides, it’d be a pity for the Injuns
to scalp you. Long’s folks travel in
trains they don’t pester. Let one, two,
three tackle the trace and a dozen or
twenty pounce on ’em and that’s the
last of that outfit.”
 “How come they don’t get you
folks?”
  Long Sam indicated the shooting
iron. “They seen Pappy use that tool.”
The talk of the ex-warriors drifted
to them. “I’ll tell you, that Chicka-
maugy she shore were one ripsnorter
of a battle!”. . .“By Judas I tell you
for a little we’d of licked the britches
off ye!”.. .“By dam's, for a little mori
and apt as not you wouldn’t be
hyar!”.. .“Nor you!”...
  Long Sam shrugged, grinned. “It’s
that way ever’time some the veterans
of the wars drift through. Now it’s a
cornfed, and they laugh and holler.
Then hit’s a Yank and they paw up
the earth like a couple bulls.”
  “Many folks a-passing through?”
“They come from yan,” pointing
back, “and go yan," pointing ahead.
“Droves and droves and droves. You
wouldn’t know they was that many
folks in this world. All wanting to get
someplace they ain’t.”
  “I wouldn’t mind staying,” Betty
said.
  Far up the river Long Sam's keen
eyes saw something dark lying against
the fringe of willows. “Pappy,” he
said.
 “Whut?”
  “Looky yan.” His voice was low. He
pointed. The old man looked. He
rubbed his eyes.
  “I don’t see nothin’."
  “Hit’s a canoe.”
  “Naw. Hit’s a drift log.”
 Long Sam kept looking. Betty
looked. The stranger stared. The old
woman didn’t want to look, she was
too scared; but she looked anyhow,
whispering hoarsely, "Injuns?”
  “Hit’s' a bullboat, and they hid in the
willers.”
  “Mout could be,” Pappy admitted.
“My eyes ain’t as pert as they used to
be when I could knock a Yank out of
a tree a mile away.”
  “What kind of weepins you tote,
stranger?” Long Sam asked the
Yankee.
  “The kind what I killed me a mess
of rebs with—musket and pistols and
a couple blades forged out of scythes;
I heard tell the buffalo grass was
tough and made ’em ’specially to
whack grass.”
  “Where’s they at?”
  “Down in the wagon body.”
  “Haul ’em out.”
 The old woman moaned. “I don’t
want to see no Injun fighting.”
 “We don’t neither,” Pappy said
grimly. “But that ain’t fixing to help
none if hit comes on.”
  They watched what they had seen
hidden in the willows and it was only
AS FAST AS THEY CAME
21
a moment or two before Long Sam's
report was verified. The boat shoved
from its covert and headed into the
fast water. It came swiftly, handled
by two rowers, one an Indian in the
stern, stripped to his waist and noth-
ing else but a loin cloth; the other in
the bow, wearing buckskin and hick-
ory. He also wore a hat. At this dis-
tance he seemed more like a white
than a redman.
  “Whut’s that they got in the boat?”
“Looks like a mess of wilier
branches.”
  And so it did—long limber willow
limbs with the leaves still fresh, cover-
ing a mysterious cargo.
  “She’s a bullboat, all right, shore as
sour apples,” Pappy admitted.
  A bullboat was a type of canoe not
too often used by Indians. It was
made by bending a very tough kind
of wood, hickory, yew if it could be
obtained, or splint oak, for ribs; and
then by running a light tough keel
along the bottom, and the same kind
of wood around the tops of the ribs
as a gunwale. Over this serviceable
skeleton buffalo hides would be
stretched. When the hides cured over
the cedar resin calking, the bullboat
was light, water-tight and swift.
  By this time the canoe had come
within hail.
  “Cody,” drifted over the water.
  “Cody hell!" Pappy said.
  “Cody friend.”
  “That’s that half-breed,” Long Sam
said. “His pappy was a Mormon mis-
sionary, or something.”
  “Wouldn’t trust the likes of him
with the life of a dead mule,” Pappy
said. “You ones come down off the
load.”
LONG SAM helped Betty down, and
took his time, liking the chore. The
old woman got so flustered her foot
slipped and her fat leg got hung up in
the sow’s crate. She began to yell like
something possessed. “It’s chawing
off my leg!” Then she realized the
word was indelicate and changed it.
“Limb.”
  Pappy was calling back to the half-
breed. “Come no nigher, Cody. What’s
your business?”
  “Cody trade.”
  “Cody trade what?”
  “Cody trade buffalo meat.” He ges-
tured toward the cargo concealed un-
der the Willow boughs.
  "Don’t you trust him, Pappy,” Long
Sam said. “They’s Injuns under them
wilier branches.”
  “Whar you get buffalo meat?”
Hadn’t been a buffalo sighted in
weeks.
  Cody made a gesture toward the
headwaters.
  “Tell your mammy to stop her
squalling, a body can't hear himself
cuss,” Long Sam said to Betty. Mean-
while he was busy. The Yankee had
laid out his rifle, his pistols, and the
scythe blades.
  “Now hand down that thar front of
the bedstead,” Long Sam said.
  The Yank put that off the load. The
woman kept yelling. The tread mule
understood the racket as a signal to
pause. The boat now was drifting
down the current. Cody and his cargo
were coming nigher. Pappy kept up a
parley.
  “Lay down on your belly,” Long
Sam told Betty. “Know what to do
with a shootin’ arn?”
  “You shoot it.”
  “Take one yur pappy’s pistols. But
don’t waste no lead till we know for
sure.”
  He had got the bedstead between
the wagon and the side of the ferry-
boat. It made a good barricade. The
horseflies and the old woman’s squalls
had the hitched mules nervous, and
the lead team was tugging at their
halters.
  Long Sam took Pappy’s rifle and
bellied alongside Betty until he could
sight upon Cody and the bullboat un-
der the bedstead. It wasn’t much of an
ambush, but it was better than none.
  “Don't shoot till I give the word.”
Pappy said. low. “We don’t want to
start nothin’.’’ After all, the half-
breed might be friendly.
  It was just this element of doubt
that always made it so dangerous.
Long Sam could have killed either the
Indian or Cody, but if those willows
covered a half dozen warriors and
their guns, that would only start the
battle.
  His eyes lifted and he searched the
shoreline from whence had come the
bullboat. This time there was no
doul/t It was a typical Indian canoe,
22
2-GUN WESTERN
and it had as many as ten braves in it.
“Ain’t no use waiting, Pappy.”
“How?”
  “I say hain’t no use loitering.
They’s another boat load of ’em wait-
ing up the river.”
  "The divil ye say.”
  Long Sam did not wait for the order
to fire. Seconds now were too pre-
cious to waste. He let fly with the
shooting iron that toted a slug the
size of a buckeye, that Pappy had
done notable carnage with. It was
loaded with a round ball, not like the
Mine ball, and wadded it with a
double charge of powder. Pappy had
worked out the logistics of it him-
self. At the instant of explosion the
soft ball mushroomed and filled the
barrel. When it issued it was twirl-
ing at great speed, and when it hit,
it did considerable damage.
 Pappy emitted a blood-curdling
groan. “You missed him, bub!”
 Which Long Sam had. But the
Yank, all his battle blood roiled by the
unfinished fight he’d had with an old
enemy, now had something he could
take out his hate on. His shot knocked
the Indian in the stern into the river.
Then up out of the willow wood rose
the hidden braves. They poured a
deadly fire into the ferryboat.
  Long Sam saw the bullets splinter
through the bedstead over his head.
The redskins hadn't had too much
time to take aim. But they laid out a
a rear mule and crippled one of the
lead mules, and the beasts plunged.
The treadmill brute reared, tried to
jump out of his stall, got his leg hung
in the planks, and plunged about,
whinnying piteously.
  “Gimme that thar weepin!” Pappy
snarled.
  He snatched it from his son’s hand.
He reloaded with the skill of an an-
cient warrior. He knew how to use a
wagon for cover. The Yankee knew
what he was doing, too. He muttered,
“Been laying all my time to kill me a
mess of Injuns.”
  Long Sam was engaged in grabbing
the bridles of the snorting, plunging
mules and keeping them from drag-
ging wagon, cargo, old woman and
squealing sow and pigs into the river.
It was a man's-sized chore. But he
watched the bullboat, and the warrior
canoe a quarter mile up the river.
HE BULLBOAT was sinking. The
Indians became aware of their di-
lemma as the Yank knocked Cody’s
brains out. There now were six of
them. Nothing was left but to swim.
Some clung to the boat which, as soon
as they got out of it, still floated.
Pappy took one neatly through the
head. The Yank took another neatly
the same way. You could count ’em
off—four now, and they were agitated
like wasps when you stick a flame into
their nest.
  They hadn't quite figured on this.
To them it looked like two old men,
an old woman, a young squirt of a boy,
and a scared girl. Now they were try-
ing to save their guns, unable to shoot
now they were in the river, and at the
same time save their hides.
 But reinforcements were moving
swiftly to their relief.
 “Thar they come, Pappy!” Long
Sam yelled.
  A rifle ball whizzed past his ears.
Too close to ease his headache. “Lay
low,” he told Betty. With ten fresh
ones on hand the redskins might man-
age to board the ferryboat. Likely
they figured the junk on the wagon
worth the risk. Some of the trashiest
of these emigrants carried gold. No
doubt they had also sighted the young
girl. Such booty always stirred the
braves to their greatest efforts.
  No use shooting at the canoe. Long
Sam realized. It was a log hollowed
out with fire and hatchets. You
couldn’t sink the thing. Here they
came. Knowing what they were going
up against, the Indians moved des-
perately into the task confronting
them. Pappy knocked one down and
the Yank knocked one down. I~ ipv
reloaded and the Yank reloaded and
they let fly and now there were seven
braves capable of fighting.
  But the canoe was only a dozen
lengths away. The mules were raising
cain. Long Sam reached for the scythe
blade. The redskins were shooting but
it took them time to reload also. They
were lying low in the canoe, doing
their chores with apt fingers.
  “Here they come!” Long Sam yelled
again and the Indians shot their war
canoe right up against the ferryboat.
Strangely enough, the old woman on
AS FAST AS THEY CAME
23
top of the feather mattress made no
sound. “Dead,” Long Sam figured.
  An Indian grabbed the edge of the
boat to pull himself aboard, his knife
in his teeth. Long Sam laid a nice
swish with the scythe blade and cut
off his hand. Betty was shooting
point-blank with the pistols. Pappy
and the Yankee had reloaded and
fired again.
 Long Sam did then what he had
planned all along, if it came to that.
He laid the flat side of the blade on
the rump of the mule that had been
bucking the worst, cut the leather
trace, and the beast jumped off the
side of the boat into the water. Then
Long Sam belted the other mule and
it snatched the wagon and tumbled it
onto the Indian canoe, long Sam
whacking rapidly at traces and tie
ropes to free this animal and the led
mules and the cow and calf.
 Such a milling around Long Sam
never dreamed of. Four mules and the
cattle churning the river. Redskins
trying to get out from under the wag-
on. Wagon, swimming cows and
mules, canoe, and ferryboat by this
time had drifted down the river far
past the landing. An Indian who
hadn’t died, given up, or swum away,
and who still had his gun, shot at
Pappy. Long Sam saw Pappy grow
limp. The Yank killed the Indian.
Betty was still lying on her belly,
pistol in hand. Long Sam discovered
blood running out of him over his
clothes, and stared at it in wonder.
  He decided he would stay alive long
enough to get the treadmill mule’s leg
undone and see if it would be possi-
ble to navigate the ferryboat back up
the river, by warping and poling. The
Yank examined Pappy.
  “I seen ’em hit worse’n that and
live to fight another day, bub,” he
said to Long Sam. “I’m one of ’em.
But he’s sorter bunged up, at that.”
  He stood and looked in all direc-
tions. “By Judas, where’s my old
woman?”
  “She’s gone, Paw,” Betty said.
  “Gone where?”	^
  But he knew.
  Long Sam pulled off his shirt. He
saw something that looked like a rib
sticking out. Betty pushed it back in,
bound him in bandages. She didn't
bawl. She helped Long John and her
father warp the boat back to the land-
ing, tie it up. Strangely, the sun was
still shining. All this had happened
not in a lifetime but in moments—and
not too many even of them. Fifteen,
twenty, at the outside.
  The Yank said, “I’m going after,
my cows and my mules and my wag-
on. I can’t go West without them.”
Betty helped Long John up the rise
to the shack. The Yank toted Pappy
up and put him in the bed, saying,
“I’ll be back soon’s I get my animals.”
Ma was gone. So were the hogs and
chickens. Betty said to her father
with a weary kind of finality, “Pa,
I'm not going West no farther. I’m
going to stay right here. This is far
enough toward the setting sun for
me.”
  A snort of rum raised Long Sam’s
hopes of his life.
  “I didn’t miss that half-breed Cody,
Betty,” he said.
  “You didn’t? You didn’t hit him.”
“I shot at the waterline of the bull-
boat. I knew if it was loaded with red-
skins it would sink and that would
give us a chance to pick ’em off.”
Betty patted his cheek. “You go to
sleep. I knew you were as good a shot
as Pa or your Pappy.”
  He took her hand. “You fixing to
stay?”
  “It's a hard thing to say, but Pa
probably ain’t going West now, where
there ain’t any women. He’ll likely
stay here and wait till some show up.
But that’ll be long enough for me and
you.”
  Long John sank away into a rum-
my coma, loading and firing Pappy’s
shootin’ arm and knocking ’em dead
as fast as they came...	• END
IT’S A LITTLE weapon, but since
its birth over 120 years ago, it
has grown to be the greatest kil-
ler of them all. It’s been called the
“great equalizer” because it makes
little men big, and big men afraid, and
today its voice thunders throughout
the world.
  It’s as American as Buffalo Bill,
or Teddy Roosevelt, or Ike Eisen-
hower. It’s an international as the
United Nations. The perseverance of
one man—his indomitable faith in his
invention—brought it into being, and
to the last century it was as im-
portant a discovery as the A-bomb is
to ours. The man and his brainchild
altered the course of world history.
They caused wars, and prevented
them. The man was Samuel Colt, and
his weapon—the Colt Repeating
Pistol.

Built for the Army, taken
over by the gunslingers,
the "great equalizer" is
still knocking over every-
to
as well as deadly ones, there was no
peace in either the history of the
weapon itself or in the life of the man
who created it.
  Samuel Colt was only 22 years old,
in 1836, when he was presented with
a legal document by Andrew Jackson
giving him the basic patent for a re-
volving pistol. The idea wasn’t new,
but he was the first to have the skill
to put the various pieces together
and make them work.
  The first single-shot pistol was
made in Pistola, Italy, in 1540. It was
a hand-held pipe with a large hole at
one end and a smaller one at the
other. The measured gunpowder was
poured through the large hole and
then the lead bullet was seated c*n
top of it. A flame applied to the small
hole ignited the powder.
The flame could be supplied by a
piece of rope soaked in saltpeter
which was ignited, or by a wheel lock
which was wound
up and released to

and were applicable to the hand-held
weapon.
  Gunsmiths before Colt’s time had
tried to perfect a revolving cylinder
that would give a soldier multiple
shots, but each design was far too
complicated, using the ignition meth-
ods just mentioned. Many of them
did work, at least in principle, but
weren’t reliable enough to become
popular, especially when a man's life
was at stake. The same was true of the
pepperbox, the term applied to the
multi-barreled pistol which had a
number of barrels made to revolve in
front of the hammer. The advent of
percussion ignition gave Colt his im-
petus.
  The percussion cap was a small
metal cup with a primer chemical in
its base. It was fitted over a nipple
in the rear of the breech. When the
hammer was snapped on the cap, the
primer flashed through a hole drilled
in the nipple and leading to the
powder chamber.
  Colt saw its possibilites immediate-
ly and based his revolving-breech-
block rifles and pistols on its use, but
he had a fight for recognition on his
hands. His only customer at the time
could be the United States military,
and they never accepted the percus-
sion cap ignition even on muskets
until after the war with Mexico in
1848—almost 32 years after the cap
had been perfected.
  No one knows exactly how Colt be-
came interested in firearms. Perhaps
it was a combination of his inventive
spirit (he also made an underwater
bomb—which didn’t go off—and,
later, a submarine mine—which did)
and the fact that he was forced to
leave Amherst Academy when he was
15 for shooting off a firearm, an act
strictly forbidden by the school.
  Sam Colt had gotten his charter
from New Jersey in 1836, and started
his own factory in Paterson. He called
it the Patent Arms Company. His
first step was to whittle wooden
models showing his pistol’s mechan-
ism, and on the basis of these he
received a few orders from Major
Sam Hall of Texas, then still an in-
dependent republic.
  In 1837 he took some of his first
real guns to the Washington Arsenal
which rejected them, considering
them too heavy, expensive to make,
too delicate for rough use in battle,
and—too much of a tempation for a
soldier to fire more than once and
thus waste ammunition. But the
American Institute of New York
awarded a gold medal to his ten-
chamber revolving-breech rifle which
operated similarly to the pistol.
  In a demonstration with it he fired
50 ball bullets in less than nine min-
utes, hand-loading from a powder
flask and using percussion caps. For-
ty of the bullets were shot at a 40-
yard target 12 by 30 by 3% inches.
Twenty-three hit it and all of these
went through it. But they wanted
nothing to do with his pistol, saying
it was strictly a military weapon. At
this time Colt was only 23 years old.
  War had broken out in Florida in
1838. This territory, not a State until
1845, was having trouble with the
Seminole Indians under the leader-
ship of Chief Osceola. Colt packed
100 rifles and pistols and set out for
Fort Jupiter on East Florida’s In-
dian River. He sold them quickly
since they were badly needed against
the hard-fighting redmen, but he ex-
perienced infinite trouble in getting
payment.
  In 1839, Colt patented a waterproof
cartridge made of tin foil with the
bullet sealed to it with wax. In this
year his rifles began to become pop-
ular, especially among the militia of
New Jersey and Michigan. New Jer-
sey had asked Washington for per-
mission to use Colt’s weapons as
standard equipment, but it was re-
fused. Sam Colt was discouraged, but
Texas came to his rescue.
  Texas had won her independence
from Mexico in 1836 soon after the
battle of the Alamo. The Texas Rang-
ers, organized in 1835, were using
some of Colt’s guns, but they weren't
working too well, especially against
the Comanche Indians who became
Texas' big problem after the Mex-
icans.
  These redmen were cruel and ac-
complished warriors. Mounted on a
fast horse, each could shoot 100 ar-
rows so fast that one would be in the
air constantly, and each could pierce
a man easily. In addition to his ar-
rows, each Comanche carried a shield
and a 14-foot spear. They would dash
26
2-GUN WESTERN
at the Rangers, fire 20 arrows, then
retreat, all in the space of a minute.
 The Rangers would dismount for
defense and fight back from afoot
with one or two single-shot pistols
and a single-shot rifle, each of which
had to be slowly reloaded by hand.
The first pistols Colt provided for
them—although they contained as
many as five shots—didn't give the
Rangers all the help they needed.
The pistols had to be taken apart in
three pieces (barrel, cylinder with
five chambers, and frame), the right
amount of powder had to be poured
into each chamber, followed by the
wad that held the powder in place,
followed by the ball on top of the
wad, whereupon the pistol was reas-
sembled. All this took time, and
certainly could not be carried out on
a prancing or galloping horse, which
meant that in spite of greater fire
power the men were still at a great
disadvantage: they still had to dis-
mount in order to fight.
  It was Colt’s new five-shot one-
piece pistol, patented in 1839, that
turned the tide for Texas. Thanks to
its built-in rammer, this weapon no
longer needed to be taken apart, and
while the reloading operation re-
mained basically the same it could
now be carried out on horseback, thus
bringing the Rangers’ maneuverabili-
ty up to par with the Indians’.
  A number of years later the Rang-
ers were under the command of Capt.
John Coffee Hays of Tennessee. He
and 14 of his men were returning to
San Antonio after a scouting trip
when they were attacked by 80 Com-
anches who raced at them in the usual
fashion, expecting the men to fire
their weapons and then, before they
could reload, the Indians would have
15 scalps on their belts. But they
didn’t know the Rangers were armed
with the new Colts.
  A short while later they fled, leav-
ing 40 redmen on the field. Two
white men were injured. Now the
Comanches soon sued for peace. One
chief said that it was impossible to
fight a white man who had a shot
for every finger of his hand.
  That was just the beginning. Or-
ders came from the Texian Fleet (not
called Texan until it was annexed as
a state) for 180 carbines at $55 each
and 180 belt pistols at $35 each. The
Texas Rangers wanted 120 carbines
and 160 pistols. In 1840 Florida
ordered rifles, pistols and 100,000
waterproof cartridges for use in its
swamps. A resolution was introduced
in the U. S. Senate to provide the
armed forces with Colts and Sam was
happy when it looked as though he
might at last be on the verge of suc-
cess—but this happiness was short-
lived.
  The turbulent politics of 1841 saw
three presidents—Van Buren, Har-
rison and Tyler—and Colt’s resolu-
tion was lost in the shuffle. The
government finally bought 100 car-
bines. In this year its Harper’s Ferry
Arsenal finally turned out a military
percussion rifle, but full conversion
didn’t come until seven years later.
FOR A few years Sam Colt was in
real trouble. His company went
bankrupt; he was arrested for a $400
debt; his brother was convicted of
murder and killed himself in his cell,
leaving his destitute family on Sam's
hands. Then, in 1846, Texas saved
Colt, as Colt had previously saved
Texas in her war with the Indians.
  Texas acquired statehood in Feb-
ruary, 1846, and in April, United
States soldiers fought against Mex-
icans; the Mexican War had begun.
Captain Sam Walker came to New
York to get Colt firearms—lots of
them. But Colt had no money, not
even machinery. It had all been sold
when his Patent Arms Company went
bankrupt, but Sam refused to be
licked. He made a contract with Eli
Whitney for the manufacture of 1,000
six-shot pistols in his plant. Colt
didn’t even have one of his own
pistols as a sample to begin produc-
tion. Finally he obtained one from a
friend. Holsters were made from a
wooden model Capt. Walker submit-
ted to the manufacturer.
  When the contract was completed
in 1847, Colt took the machinery and
tools, as per his agreement with
Whitney, and moved to New Haven.
But the Ordnance Department, hin-
dered by red tape, was very slow to in-
spect and approve the first 1,000 pis-
tols in spite of pressure by Walker
and Colt.
  Finally the weapons arrived in
SAM COLT’S KILLER
27
Vera Cruz five days after Walker
had been killed, a “smoking Colt in
his hand,” at Huamantla, Mexico,
when two companies of Rangers held
off 2,500 Mexicans. Walker was the
first to refer to the pistol as the
Peacemaker, and wrote a glowing
testimonial for it before he died.
  The Colt had arrived. Government
orders increased, and orders for sam-
ples came in from England, Turkey,
Germany, France and Russia, all of
them curious to see the weapon made
famous by the Mexican War. After
the war the Mexicans demanded them
in great quantities; they had had a
first-hand demonstration of the ter-
rific gun and needed no selling. Busi-
ness increased by leaps and bounds.
The pistols were improved by fluted
cylinders and pins between the per-
cussion nipples. The Colt factory
moved to bigger quarters.
  This was a period of expansion to
the West. The frontier was pushed
toward the Pacific by men armed
with plows and Colts, axes and Colts,
rifles and Colts, and bibles and Colts
(such as Brigham Young of Utah, to
whom Sam gave an engraved pair of
his guns). The pistol embodied both
the law of the marshal and the law-
lessoess of the rustler and bandit.
  In 1851 Sam went to London with
dreams of creating a great gun em-
pire there, too. At the Great Ex-
hibition in Hyde Park he had a dis-
play which eclipsed anything yet
seen in the trade. He matched his
pistol in a contest against the British
Adam's revolver, and won hands-
down. About 400 were purchased by
the British Colonial Office for use
against the Kaffir tribes in the Cape
of Good Hope. In 1853 he opened his
huge branch factory (later closed be-
cause the British would no longer
tolerate this competition) at Pimlico
on the Thames, and the English
marveled at the speed with which he
could produce production-line re-
volvers which could compete with
their custom-made models.
  Back in the United States the Colt
works were going full blast. Com-
modore Perry wanted 100 for the
Navy, which was the first sign of
interest from that branch of the serv-
ice. But business was so good that
competitors were trying to get into
the act and soon became guilty of
direct infringement of his patents.
Colt sued the one who appeared to
be the most dangerous threat to his
empire, the Massachusetts Arms Co.,
and won. Then a new episode oc-
curred which bore testimony to the
Colt.
  In 1853 Colonel John C. Fremont,
governor of California, made an ex-
ploratory trip across the Rocky
Mountains together with 19 men to
determine railroad sites. One day at
camp they were attacked by 60 Ute
Indians who told them they wanted
supplies and gunpowder. If they
couldn’t have these, they would kill
the white men. Fremont gave in-
structions to one of his men who
went outside, put a piece of paper
against a tree, and shot it with his
Navy Colt. The Indians laughed;
they could do the same with their
own rifles.
  But the gunman fired a second and
third time. Then the chief shot the
Colt, as did two of his braves. They
were amazed and decided they would
gladly pay for their supplies with
horses. They couldn't fight men who
had guns which never needed re-
loading.
  In 1855 Colt completed a vast new
armory on the banks of the Con-
necticut River in Hartford. Its Per-
sian dome can still be seen from afar
by tourists traveling the main route
through Hartford between New York
and Boston. In that year he incorpor-
ated his business into the Colt's Pat-
ent Fire-Arms Manufacturing Com-
pany. Now there was no more to be
done, and although only 41, Colt was
old before his time.
  He had succeeded in making his
dream come true, but he was a sick
man. He had contracted inflammatory
rheumatism, was getting worse. The
Civil War was imminent. The State
of Virginia asked Colt to investigate
the possibility of building an armory
at Richmond, and he sent one of hfs
men to investigate but his heart wasn’t
in it. Georgia, Alabama, Carolina—all
pleaded with him for arms. In 1861
the Confederate States of America
were formed and Colt offered his serv-
ices to Lincoln, advising him to arm
1,000,000 men immediately.

     gun was cut end

HE GUNMAN KNOWN
throughout the Territory as
Mojave Jack rode into Bent
Fork just before noon on a hot sum-
mer day. He stabled his horse at the
Dutchman’s and went down the street
to the Palace Saloon. People were
alerted wl«en he rode in and by the
time he took the stroll from the livery
barn to the saloon there were two
hundred paifs of eyes on him.
  He wasn’t anything special to look
at, being about average height and
build, but he moved with a feline
softness and quickness. His face was
all hard angles and planes, giving an
overall impression of flatness, and his
eyes were blue. He squinted so that
it was hard to see his eyes and his
head kept up a ceaseless turning as
he looked this way and that.
  There was a downward cast to his
thin mouth and Monty Ferris re-
marked later that he looked like a
man who hadn’t smiled in twenty
years. The marks of his trade were
in the single gun he wore, low, tied
down, its black butt shiny with wear,
and in the thin leather gloves that
covered his hands even on this hot
day. That and the way he acted, so
scornful and cold and aloof.
 Mojave Jack was no more than
through the doors of the Palace when
they started coming. Marshal Jim
Forbes had known they would come
and he was patiently waiting, sitting
solidly there in his big chair behind
the desk in his office. He was a
young, square-built man, with a face
burned brown by years of riding in
sun and wind, a man who had come
up the trail from Texas four times
and who knew, the smell of trouble
well. He waited while the influential,
nervous citizens of Bent Fork
2S
NOON TOMORROW

crowded into his small office. He
nodded at each man as he came in.
They didn't waste time once they
were inside. There were twelve of
them there.
  “Jim, Mojave Jack just rode into
town,” Mayor Fred Keaton announced
pompously, as if the whole didn't
know already.
  “I saw him,” Jim answered.
  “Well, what are you going to do
about it?” Bill Osborn asked hotly.
“Nothing,” Jim said.
  “What do you mean, nothing?” Ed
Holmes asked in a voice that was al-
most a shout. “You can’t let him stay.
Think of the women and kids. If he
i)tays, someone’ll get hurt. You’re
paid to keep this town clean and we
want you to do your job.”
  “I told you when I took the job
that I’d do it my way,” Jim said. He
wait smiling at them and there was a
cool contempt in that smile. "Mojave
Jack isn’t wanted anywhere in this
Territory. I have no reason to run
him out.”
  “He's killed ten men,” Fred Keaton
said. “You know he's been hired to do
those killin’s. It’s common knowledge.
Just because he’s forced his victims
to draw first, he’s gotten away with
it. But he’s here to kill someone and
you have to stop him.”
  “I’ll talk to him,” Jim said and
got to his feet. He stood for a mo-
ment, silently regarding the anxious
faces of the men. “I can’t run him out
unless he does something wrong. I
can warn him against breaking the
law and I can maybe tell him to be
gone before tomoroow noon, but that's
all. If any of you have any reason
to think he’s after you, I suggest you
get out of town fast. I'll try to
protect you, bist I can’t guarantee it.”
Jim strode through them and out of
the office, leaving an uneasy silence
behind him.
A S HE WALKED slowly down to
the Palace, Jim was thinking.
They were right, of course. Mojave
Jack was a killer and he was here on
a mission, but he was within his rights
to be here. Jim had seen the gunman
kill a man two years before in
Cheyenne and he didn’t like the idea
of going against him.
  Still, this was his town and he had
to enforce the law and protect the
people. If that meant going against
Mojave Jack, he would have to do it.
  Then he was busy trying to think
who it could be that the killer was
after. It was impossible to tell, since
anyone could have hired him to shoot
any man in town. Jim shook his head
and entered the saloon.
  Monty Ferris, the owner, was be-
hind the bar and he raised his eye-
brows in mute warning when Jim
walked in. Jim merely nodded to him
and swept his eyes around the room
until he found the still figure of
Mojave Jack sitting at one of the side
tables, his chair backed against the
wall. The gunman was watching Jim
with a strict attention, his hands
motionless on the table. Jim crossed
the room and stood beside the table.
  “Welcome to Bent Fork, Jack,” he
said. “I'm Jim Forbes, marshal here.”
"Glad to meet you, Marshal,” Mo-
jave Jack said.
  “You’ve got people here all in a
sweat,” Jim said. “They’re takin’ it
out on me. How long were you plan-
nin’ to stay?” Jim pushed his words
at the gunman slow and easy, not
wanting to anger him. Jim knew that
Mojave Jack could probably beat him
in a fight and therefore, he wanted
no fight.
  “I can’t see that it’s any of your
business,” the gunman replied coolly.
There was insolence in his tone and
that puzzled Jim. The gunman acted
like a man looking for trouble. But
from what Jim knew of Jack’s type,
they only fought when they were
paid to kill.
  “Just the same, I think you'd bet-
ter tell me. You’re welcome here
overnight. After that, you’re not wel-
come. I thought we’d better have an
understanding about that.”
 Mojave Jack smiled tightly.
“You’re a brave man, Marshal. I ad-
mire a brave man, as long as he isn’t
a fool. It would be foolish to try to
send me out of town before I’m ready
to go.” The gunman’s eyes were wide-
sprung and Jim smelled trouble on
him. The man was cocked, ready to
fight, and Jim didn’t understand it.
  “I'm just hopin’ you’ll go without
that. Noon tomorrow should be time
enough. Don't stay beyond that.”
  He turned on his heel and walked
from the saloon, catching the fright-
ened look on Monty Ferris’ face.

2-GUN WESTERN
  Going back to the office, Jim
pondered his conversation with the
gunman. He was puzzled by Mojave
Jack's edginess. It was almost as
though the man had wanted a fight,
but that couldn't be. If he was here
to kill a man, he would want to keep
out of trouble until the job was done.
  Perhaps he thought that everyone
was afraid of him and consequently
was insolent with everyone. But if
that were true, he was doing some
wrong thinking. Jim wasn’t afraid of
Mojave Jack. He had a respect for
Jack's ability with a gun, but better
gunmen had gone down. If it came
to a fight, it wouldn’t be the first
time Jim had looked through gun-
smoke.
  He intended to keep a sharp watch
on Jack while he was in town and he
intended to enforce his order to
leave. He had governed Bent Fork
for better than a year and no man was
going to change that just by riding in
with a big reputation and scaring the
people.
JIM KEPT A sharp watch on the
street all afternoon and it amused
him to see Fred Keaton slip out the
back door of the bank, saddle a horse
and line out of town. Something was
on Keaton's conscience and he was
taking no chances. At three Ed
Holmes also rode out. By five o’clock
six respected businessmen had de-
parted hurriedly. The town was quiet,
as though peopled by dead men. No-
one moved abroad and tension hung
over the street like summer heat,
close and binding. At six o’clock Mo-
jave Jack came from the Palace and
strode unhurriedly to Nell Peterson's
Cafe. Jeff left the office and went
down there at once.
  Jim sat four stools down from Mo-
jave Jack and ordered his supper. The
gunman had given him one cool ap-
praising glance when he came in and
that was all. After that the two men
ignored each other and ate in a strict
silence. Nell Peterson was nervous
and made an unaccustomed racket as
she served the three other customers.
She dropped a cup and the sound was
like a shot. Men along the counter
jumped at the noise and then grinned
foolishly. Everyone ate in frantic
haste and departed. Mojave jack took
his time, drinking a second cup of
coffee when he had finished his meal.
He and Jim were the only two diners
left in the cafe. Nell Peterson came
to take Jack’s dollar and the gunman
smiled at her.
  "You ain’t too particular who you
serve, are you, ma’am?” he asked and
turned to look full on at Jim. Nell’s
blue eyes darkened with fear and her
hand shook as she picked up the dol-
lar. She couldn’t answer.
  “Are you on the prod, Jack?” Jim
asked softly. "If you are, just make
it plain.”
  “Why, no, Marshal, not at all.
What ever gave you that idea?” Jack
got up in one quick movement and
went to the door. He stopped there
and turned about and asked, “That
was noon tomorrow, wasn’t it?”
"That’s right.”
  “So-long, Marshal,” Jack said and
left the cafe. Jim sat still, more puz-
zled than before, trying to make sense
out of the gunman’s words. Nell came
down the counter and put her hand
on his.
  “Oh, Jim, don’t cross him. He’d
kill a man just for the fun'of it. You
can see it in his eyes.”
  She was a tall girl, strong and well-
built, a girl who had always had to
work hard for what she got. She and
Jim had gone together off and on for
all the time he had been here. He
could never quite face the thought
of settling down and being married,
so he had never asked her. Her pride
was too strong to let her push him.
But she loved him and she couldn’t
conceal it at this moment. Looking
at her, Jim thought she was lovely.
He squeezed her hand and smiled.
  “Don’t worry, honey, he’s just edgy.
His kind don’t shoot men for fun.
He’s been hired to kill someone here
and as soon as he's done his job, he’ll
ride out. I stepped on his toes when
I told him to be out of town by
tomorrow noon and he wants to show
me he isn't scared any. But he’ll get
his job done before noon and be out
of here.”
  "But won't you have to arrest him
for murder?”
  “He’s too smart for that. He'll make
the other man draw first and claim
self-defense. I won’t have anything
to hold him for.”
  "But he was mad at you, Jim. The
NOON TOMORROW
31
way he looked at you, I thought he
was going to draw on you right in
here.”
  “It almost seemed that way,” Jim
agreed, “but it couldn’t be. He’d have
no reason for hunting me. No-one
would pay good money to have me
killed. No, he’s just a killer and they
all go off the deep end in time. His
nerves are probably about shot.” Jim
stood up and smiled again. “Don't
worry about him.”
  “I hope you're right,” she said
doubtfully. He started for the door
and she said, "Jim,” and came
around th*e counter.
HE STOPPED and she walked up
to him and kissed him on the lips
and stepped back, her face very grave.
It surprised him so that he stood
motionless for a moment and then he
stepped forward, took her in his arms
and kissed her fully. When he re-
leased her and stepped back, he was
shaken by the intensity of the kiss
and by the warm crush of her soft
body against him.
  "I guess,” he said, “it is time to
either fish or cut bait, is that it,
Nell?”
  “That's for you to know, Jim.”
  ‘‘Why, I suppose that’s right. I’ll be
around to see you sometime after
noon tomorrow.” He stepped forward
and kissed her quickly and wheeled
to walk from the cafe. The blonde
girl stood with her hands pressed
over her heart and her face heavy
with worry for him.
  A boy on the street told Jim that
Mojave Jack was again in the Palace
and he wondered about that. The gun-
man was apparently in no hurry to
seek out his victim. With only a few
hours remaining to him, it seemed
strange that Jack would not get to
work. Jim couldn’t believe that the
gunman would wait past noon. That
would mean another fight and with
a man who knew how to use a gun.
Jack’s kind didn’t take unnecessary
chances.
  Maybe Jack thought his victim
would come to the saloon tonight, a
thought that ordinarily wouldn’t be
too far off, since the Palace was the
town’s best saloon. But everyone knew
the gunman was in town and if a man
had any reason to think that he was
marked for death, he would not go
near the place. Several men.had rid-
den out already. It had Jim baffled.
  He made his usual night rounds,
hitting all the saloons, including the
Palace, and everything was running
smoothly. In most of the places a
sizeable crowd was on hand and they
were all eager to talk to Jim about
Mojave Jack. Jim didn’t stop to talk.
He knew no more about it than they
did. The word was out that he had
given the killer until tomorrow noon
to leave and they were speculating
about that, but he let them speculate.
  When he came to the Palace, he
found it deserted except for Mojave
Jack, old Doc Barnes and Monty
Ferris. The gunman only glanced at
Jim incuriously and went back to his
game of cards. Ferris shrugged ex-
pressively and Jim shook his head.
  He went out and down the street
and met Nell as she closed the cafe
at ten. He walked her home and nei-
ther of them mentioned Mojave Jack.
He knew she was worried, but she
knew men and she sensed that he
didn't want to talk about it. She
would do her worrying in private.
His respect for her increased with
the knowledge that she refused to
make his job tougher by saddling him
with her worries.
  After he left Nell, Jim continued
his patrol of the streets until mid-
nite, but the town was quiet. It was
the time of year when there was
plenty of work on the ranches and
the only big night was Saturday. Mo-
jave Jack sat quietly in the Palace,
showing no interest in the town or
its people, a deadly enigma. Shaking
his head in wonder, Jim went to his
room at the hotel, undressed and
turned in. He laid awake a long time
thinking, but got nowhere and final-
ly dropped into an uneasy sleep.
IN THE MORNING, Jim was down
early and had breakfast at Nell’s.
There were dark circles under her
eyes, telling of a sleepless night, but
she had a smile for him and she didn't
mention Mojave Jack. After break-
fast, he went to the Palace and found
Monty Ferris in his office in the back
of the saloon. There was no-one else
in the place, except Ernie Shields,
the swamper, who was lazily sweep-
ing up. Jim sat down and pushed
his hat back and smiled at Monty.
32
2-GUN WESTERN
  “Well, what happened?”
  “Nothing happened,” the saloon-
keeper said tersely. “Except he
ruined my business. He just sat there
dealin’ cards and watchin’ the door.
He drank one beer between eight and
one and got up and left. I can't fig-
ure it out. Somethin’s up, but I can’t
get the drift of it.”
  “I can’t either. I was certain he
came here to kill someone and he
acts like he did, but nothin’s hap-
pened and he doesn’t go lookin’ for
anyone.” Jim got up and settled his
hat on his head. “If he starts any-
thing in here this morning, let me
know and I’ll come runnin’. He didn’t
ride clear up here from Cheyenne for
the exercise.”
  “If he’s still here at noon, what’re
you going to do?” Monty asked flat-
ty-
  “Tell him to leave town.”
  "And if he don’t go?”
  “I’ll have to put him out. He’s done
nothing I can arrest him for, but he’s
disturbin' the peace just the same. I
gave him time enough; at noon, he
goes.”
  “I don’t envy you the job. He’s a
mean one. You look into his eyes and
there’s nothing there. They’re as cold
as a dead mackerel.”
  “So-long, Monty,” Jim said and
walked through the saloon and out
onto the board walk.
  He was just up the street from the
hotel now and Mojave Jack came out
onto the porch. He looked up and
saw Jim and a cold smile touched the
corners of his mouth. It was less a
smile than a smirk and Jim felt a
cold tingle along his spine, almost
like a warning. There was something
evil about Mojave Jack, something
missing that was found in decent men
and it shook everyone when they saw
it.
  Jim returned the stare and Mojave
Jack nodded and turned off the porch.
He went up the street and turned
in at the cafe. Jim angled across the
street to his office. He dropped into
a chair and prepared to wait. Until
Mojave Jack showed his hand, there
was little he could do. He took out
his .45, checked the brass butts of
the loads, slid the gun back into
holster.
  Then he was pushed by a sudden
burst of energy and got to his feet
and punched the shells out of his
gun. For the next fifteen minutes,
he practiced drawing and firing. He
drew and snapped the hammer at
pictures and reward dodgers on the
wall. Satisfied at last, he replaced the
shells in the gun and settled again in
the chair.
  The morning dragged slowly by.
By ten o’clock Jim felt as if he were
sitting on a keg of dynamite. The
whole town was waiting with a dread
that was faintly mixed with anticipa-
tion. Life in Bent Fork was usually
pretty dull and Mojave Jack had
wiped out that dullness. The people
feared him, yet his presence fascin-
ated them and they had passed the
stories about him from mouth to
mouth until now he was reputed to
have killed a hundred men and was
supposed to be faster than Wild
Bill. In his office, Jim watched the
hands of the clock crawl towards
noon and began to think for the first
time that Mojave Jack was not going
to leave. It didn’t make sense, but
that’s how it looked.
AT TEN-THIRTY, Jim heard a
horse come down Main at the
gallop and went to the window to
see who it was. Johnny Benton, who
rode for Pete Hanson’s Lazy 3, rode
down the street and pulled into the
hitchrack at the Palace. Johnny was
twenty, slim and reckless and a little
wild, but a good kid. He was wearing
a gun, but Mojave Jack wouldn’t be
after him. Jim returned to his chair
and settled down. He had barely got-
ten settled when boots thudded along
the walk and Ernie Shields burst
into the office. The old swamper was
white and shaking with excitement.
  “Monty says to come quick, Jim.
That killer’s got Johnny Benton
cornered and's givin' him a rough
time of it. It looks like Johnny was
the one he was after."
  Jim was out of his chair and run-
ning before the words were out of
Ernie's mouth. He aimed for the
door of the Palace and ran hard, not
stopping to think about this. In the
back of his mind it seemed strange
that a high-priced killer like Mojave
Jack should ride five hundred miles
to take on Johnny Benton. Johnny
was no gunman. Anyone who half-
way knew how to use a gun could
NOON TOMORROW
33
have done a job on Johnny. But in his
haste, Jim didn’t take time to think
it out.
  Jim piled through the door of the
Palace and found Johnny Benton
still-posted in the center of the floor.
Mojave Jack leaned back negligently,
his elbows resting on the bar. His
right hand was dropped down near
the butt of his gun and that wicked
smile curled the corners of his lips.
Johnny was white-faced with shock
and fear, but he held his ground.
  “What you pickin’ on me for?”
Johnny asked as Jim came in.
  "I ain’t pickin’ on you, boy. I just
said you looked like a yellow sheep-
herder. It ain't my fault the way
you look.”
  Jim moved up on Johnny's right
side and Mojave Jack straightened.
A queer light came into his eyes, a
glitter, and suddenly it hit Jim with
all the force of a sledge-hammer blow
to the belly. It wasn’t Johnny Benton
that the killer wanted. That was a
ruse. His real victim was Jim Forbes.
For a moment the knowledge para-
lyzed Jim and then his mind began
to function coldly and surely. If he
was to survive, he had to think clear-
ly, surely.
  "Get out of here, Johnny,” Jim
said. “There’ll be no fightin’ in my
town.” Johnny wanted to go, but he
didn't want to appear a coward, so
he hung back for a moment. “Get
movin’, Johnny,” Jim said again.
  This time the young puncher left.
Monty Ferris stirred behind the bar,
as though released from the weight of
some mighty load. He sighed.
 Jim laughed then and he saw
surprise momentarily break the sur-
face of Mojave Jack’s eyes. “You can
quit actin’, Jack. It took me long
enough, but I finally know who you
came to kill. Why didn’t you just
say so yesterday afternoon instead of
sparrin’ around all this time? You
came to kill me.”
  Jim heard Monty Ferris gasp and
then Mojave Jack’s harsh voice
rasped through the stillness. “That’s
right, Marshal, I came to get you and
no-one hired me to do it. I wanted
an excuse to get you to draw on me
and that young puncher was it. But
he wouldn’t quite take the bait. You
got here too fast.”
  Jim was placed twenty paces from
Mojave Jack and he wasn’t going to
let the man get any closer. At
twenty paces a man could easily
miss, especially if he hurried the
shot. Jim didn’t fool himself that he
could outdraw the killer, so he had
to make the man miss that first shot.
  "What did I ever do to you?” Jim
asked.
  “You killed my brother in the
street here last fall. He didn’t have
a chance.”
 Jim remembered the man and
thinking back he could see now that
there was a strong family resemblance
between the two.
  “I remember,” he said. "He was in
here drinking and causing trouble. I
warned him to cut it out and left. He
followed me out and called to me as
I walked across the street. He drew
and fired when I turned on him. His
first shot missed and mine didn’t.”
“You killed him and I'm here to
square accounts. That’s all that mat-
ters.”
  “That would be all that mattered
with you,” Jim said, a sneer in his
voice. “Sure, I shot him down and
I’d do it again. He was a worthless,
gutless punk, Jack, just like you.”
He saw the words hit the gunman
like physical blows, saw the hate that
flared in his eyes. Mojave Jack’s
mouth twitched spasmodically and he
looked like a crazy man. Jim felt cold
and alone, his senses acutely tuned
to every move the deadly one in front
of him made.
  Mojave Jack said, "I’m going to
shoot you in the belly and watch
you claw the floor while you die.”
He stopped talking and Jim
laughed at him. Jim saw the gunman’s
eyes flicker wildly once, then nar-
row, saw his shoulder dip, and Jim
drew. Mojave Jack’s draw was a
flash that beat Jim a full tenth of a
second. The killer’s’ gun roared and
bucked back in his hand, but the
slug missed Jim’s hip a split hair.
Jim’s gun was out and he fired, not
aiming. He lowered the gun to his
side, knowing he would have no time
for a second shot.
 Mojave Jack was jerked back
against the bar as though some
mighty fist had smashed him in the
chest. His gun fell from his hand
and bounced once on the floor. He

“HR

The cry carried from claim to claim
and sweating miners tossed aside
remarkable auburn-haired beauty who,
in the past few months, had enlivened
both Caleb’s life and the season of
serious drama at San Francisco’s

shovel and pan, stopped a moment to
consider the news, and drifted toward
the main camp.
  Caleb Halloway stirred. His six-
foot frame was stretched comfortably
in the shade of his tent, a favorite
position in the late afternoons while
other men labored.
  “John Duncan’s a fool and his horse
is an ass,” Caleb said indignantly and
the saying of it made him feel better;
helped greatly to break the spell cast
over him by the contents of a letter
received that morning from one Ellen
O’Faye. Ellen was a young lady of
remote camp called Dogleg, in answer
to a brief note of his, was in the na-
ture of a surprise and the veiled sum-
 He'd put endless dusty
 miles and numberless
 brawling gold camps be-
 tween them, but it was a
 question whether Caleb
 Halloway could ever for-
 get Miss Ellen O'Faye...
34
FINAL CURTAIN
35
mons it contained was pure mystery.
  “. . And dear Caleb.” she wrote, “if
they do Uncle Windmill out of his
little gold strike, you must come to
my hanging, for I’ll happily murder a
vile person named Reno Cucci. .
  Caleb sighed. He got to his feet,
stretched and brushed aimlessly at his
clothing. He placed the letter of Ellen
O’Faye carefully in his pocket and
with an ample kerchief bent to flick
at the dust layering his tightly-
tailored boot.
  Lean and sun-whipped from his re-
cent journey south, Caleb still held
the touch of pallor across his features
which hinted at time spent on the
stage or in the pulpit. He had, in fact,
graced the boards of Washington
Hall and Sacramento’s Eagle Theater
in drama both legitimate and lusty.
His present exile was purely the re-
sult of an unprecedented emotional
collision with Miss Ellen O'Faye.
  He had fallen in love, which was a
matter of outrageous interest super-
imposed upon no principal. If he was
in love, he also was chronically penni-
less and with scant prospects for the
future. He’d fled like a coward from
Miss O'Faye; placed many miles and
brawling gold camps between them.
Maybe she would go away, back East,
and become famous and leave the
West and Caleb Halloway alone.
  Inside his patchwork shanty of can-
vas and board, Caleb donned a ruffled
shirt and a cravat, a waistcoat of calf-
skin and a frock coat cut high in the
back and with fine buttons and wide,
silk lapels. The coat alone had cost
him $50 during a brief, golden period
along San Francisco’s Ambrosial Path.
On his head he cocked a silk hat with
a broad, graceful roll, which added a
fine dignity to his appearance. Caleb
was a man of no colossal humility.
  “And one man in his time,” he said
wryly, “plays many roles.” Then he
stepped out into the hullabaloo of the
Mariposa diggings.
lnORTY MEN milled like nervous
  cattle in the opening before the cir-
cular tent saloon. Tied soundly to the
trunk of a tree was a young miner
known to Caleb as Joe Salem.
Upon Caleb’s approach, the talk and
milling came to a stop. Had Judge
Addison Halloway, on his bench back
in New York, viewed the scene, he
might well have experienced a mo-
mentary lessening of hostility toward
this youngest son; the one who had
seen fit to cast away a respectable
career in the law for the sins and
specious glories of the dramatic hall.
  On three previous occasions in as
many weeks, Caleb Halloway had held
court in Mariposa. Tense and bellig-
erent crowds had sensed the edge of
calm reason in his rulings and noted
favorably his judicial bearing. He
nodded to many around and stood
waiting, silent. The assemblage must
act of its own accord, in the terms
and traditions of the ancient folk-
moot which ruled in the gold camp.
  John Duncan finally spoke up in
the shrill voice which betrayed his
emotion. “I nominate Caleb,” he said,
"to be judge of the horse thief we
got tied to the tree there.” His an-
nouncement was promptly followed
by sufficient eyes to make the elec-
tion legal.
  Caleb cleared his throat portentous-
ly. “The court,” he said, “is in order.”
  He walked to the tree and gazed
solemnly at Joe Salem. Joe was a
young, fiery-eyed man of bullish
strength and a reputation for sudden
violence. He spat contemptuously at
the ruffled shirt front, but Caleb
craftily side-stepped without losing
his composure. Turning away, he said,
“All right, John Duncan. What’s the
story?”
  “I caught him in the very act,
Caleb,” John Duncan said heatedly.
“Got a touch of the sun, so I rode in
early from the claim. Left the horse
saddled and tied while I went into th-
tent to rest. Came out later to find
Joe riding off on him.”
  There was an angry murmur from
the others. “Go on, John,” Caleb said,
“when it gets quiet.”
  “I hollered and Joe started kicking
the horse to get him going,” said
John. “Then the Wherry brothers ran
up and caught him and brought him
back and we tied him up after some
fancy scufflin’.”
  Caleb’s gaze found the Wherry
brothers in the crowd. They both nod-
ded vigorously in agreement and the
older of them said, "It’s what hap-
pened, Caleb.”
36
2-GUN WESTERN
 "I wouldn't take $300 for that
horse,” John Duncan declared. “A
good mount’s scarce in these parts
and there’s none I’ve seen as good as
this one.”
 Caleb looked at Joe Salem. "If
you’ve got any defense, Joe, we bet-
ter hear it.”
  “I've been associating with polecats
so long I got lonesome for a horse,”
Joe fired back.
 “Maybe you were drunk,” said
Caleb.
  “I was sober,” Joe said.
  “Maybe you got claim-happy, Joe,”
Caleb persisted. “Sort of lost your
head for a minute.”
  “Most sensible thing I've done since
I got to this hell-hole gold country,"
Joe Salem retorted, “I'd have rid that
horse straight to Santa Fe and points
east.”
  “He’s a confessed horse thief,” John
Duncan said high and angry.
  “Seems like time for a hangin’,” the
elder Wherry brother said.
  Caleb said, “There being no defense,
Joe Salem is found guilty of attempt-
ing to steal the horse of John Duncan.
Now there’s the question of the
penalty.”
  “He's guilty, he hangs,” said John.
Caleb turned on him and stared
coldly. “As elected presiding officer
of this meeting, I intend to do the fair
thing kccording to common sense,” he
said.
  “You afraid to hang a horse thief,”
John Duncan said.
  “Joe did a fool thing,” Caleb said,
“which I don’t think he'll repeat. And
you’ve still got your horse, John.”
“Ain’t you going to hang him?”
Caleb felt a wave of distaste rise in
him for John Duncan; a man wronged
but claiming compensation to the hilt
—compensation of another man’s life.
He pronounced judgment. “Joe Salem
gets 40 lashes on his back for tem-
porarily losing his head and trying to
ride off on another man’s horse.”
“I’ll be shot!” John Duncan yelled.
“Of all the cowardly...”
  “While the Wherry brothers turn
Joe around at his tree there and de-
liver the sentence,” Caleb cut in, “I’m
straight-away going to lick John Dun-
can for calling me a coward. The
court's adjourned.”
' ■ 'HE MORNING was grey and cold
as Caleb walked north. If there
was a stiffer man in the Mother Lode,
he was not sober to suffer as Caleb
did. His legs and arms ached sorely
and his head seemed split and held
together only by the bandage bound
tightly over his brow. One eye was
purple, puffed and closed and his
lower lip felt like some frog sat there.
His nose was broken fearsomely and
he groaned as the chill air buffed it.
  When the first ray of sun topped a
craggy peak, Caleb stopped beside a
stream to bathe his face. He sat awhile
to rest and cast a suspicious eye on
his companion.
  Joe Salem knelt down like a very
old man to cup his hands and drink at
the stream. When he stood up, Caleb
could see the pain in the deeply drawn
lines around his mouth. Caleb could
imagine the striated back shorn of
flesh and stiffening in the cold. Joe
was like some thick trunk of tree bit-
ten cruelly by the axe.
 “You should have stole a horse
’stead of tanglin' with John Duncan.”
Joe said to Caleb. “They beat my
hide off, but I still got my beautiful
face.”
 Caleb grunted. “John’s in poor
shape this morning, too,” he said.
  Joe Salem nodded. “You was doing
fine till the two of you went 20 feet
down that coyote shaft.”
  Caleb winced at the recollection of
that plunge; the rock sides of the
shaft burning his hide raw and the
slag-heap landing that came near to
unhinge-ing him.
 “You’ve busted me up for fair,
Joe,” Caleb said accusingly. “I was
a respected man in the community
till you stole a horse and I got mad
at John Duncan and refused to hang
you.”
  “You’d have been elected alcalde in
time.” Joe acknowledged. “Got a fair,
sensible streak in you or I'd be dan-
glin’ from a tree this minute.”
  Caleb shook his head, and then hung
onto it a moment with both hands to
stop the throbbing. “They don’t want
an alcalde that won’t hang a horse
thief. That’s why I was told to git
when they dragged me from that
hole.”
  “Thing is, I ain’t a real horse thief,”
PINAL CURTAIN
37
said Joe. “You got a mind and could
see it. You’re a man of justice. . .”
  “You would have done until a real
horse thief came along,” said Caleb.
He got to his feet, rolled a little with
his dizziness, and then started north.
  From Mt. Bullion, to Bear Valley,
to Bagby, to Coulterville and on north
he marched in the coming days. And
it was a painful journey to a man of
pride. Caleb felt the deep pity for
himself—an actor with both his face
and spirit mauled; an odd figure in
rough pants and jacket cast off by
some camp along the way; a filthy
flop-brimmed hat partially obscuring
a battered face thick-matted with a
tawny beard.
  There was the night the “hewgag”
brayed in a lonely Sierra camn where
Caleb and Joe found refuge. The An-
cient and Honorable Order of E
Clampus Vitus assaulted the black si-
lences with hilarious revelry and a
salubrious parade beneath a mammoth
hoopskirt emblazoned “This Is the
Banner We Fight Under!”
  Argonauts fought the ravages of
toil and boredom heroically that night
and even Joe Salem marched and was
duly initiated into bacchic and bliss-
ful unconsciousness. But Caleb had
one single drink and brooded in the
shadows.
  Next morning he pushed on again
and behind him labored Joe Salem.
Joe had been beaten, too, and driven
out, but not broken. “You’re a man of
justice, Caleb.” he’d said. But Caleb
knew that this was not so. He knew
that he was an acting man—an actor
who had filled a disastrous role one
late afternoon and fooled an oaf
named Joe Salem.
HE DRAMATIC HALL at the
camp of Dogleg was low-ceilinged.
with a slab-timbered roof which tilted
south to shed the rains and a rough
board floor which tilted north to shed
tobacco juice and tears which flowed
copiously on nights of rich drama.
The slightly elevated stage rested
precariously on wooden horses and a
painted female figure of some bosomy
munificence graced the calico curtains
which drew the thin line between
audience and player.
 Dogleg was a larger camp than
Mariposa and, to Joe Salem’s prac-
ticed eye, even less well organized.
It had the feel of an ornery, brawling
camp and Joe was surprised that
Caleb would linger there. He was
purely astonished when, on the third
day, Caleb filed a small pan-and-shov-
el claim on a stream a mile out of
camp and on that Saturday night fol-
lowed other citizens of Dogleg to the
Dramatic Hall,
  Booming laughter, oaths and gun-
fire collided mightily with wind bolts
from tall mountain peaks as miners
crowded toward the hall. A large,
soiled banner, pummeled by the gusts,
proclaimed:
THE O’FAYES—
LOVELY ELLEN AND GRAND
WILLIAM WITH COMPANY
IN
“LADY OF LYONS” AND
“OTHELLO”
  Caleb sat well back in the hall, a
curious sickness in him, the like of
which always assailed him at curtain
time. Ellen had drawn him here, even
in his present sorry condition—and
Grand William; that was Ellen’s Un-
cle Windmill O’Faye who got his
nickname from the flailing violence
with which he threw himself into his
stage portrayals. Caleb well remem-
bered the night in Sacramento when
Uncle Windmill destroyed his voice
during the mad scene in Lear. Uncle
Windmill spoke ever after in a pecu-
liarly resonant whisper.
  Ellen’s round, full voice jerked
Caleb back into the present. He was
on his feet and roaring with the rest
when she took the stage. Her little
speech was mainly cut off and she
just stood there smiling and inclining
her head and sweet-looking enough to
squeeze a man’s heart.
  She raised her hands finally. “The
show’s on,” she called out, “and we'll
do our best for you handsome gentle-
men. We’ve only one request—no
s'/ooting till the final curtain!”
  The clamor rose again and Caleb
blessed the anonymity of his hat and
beard and battered face—for Ellen
was close in that little hall; too close,
and he felt like a sad dog of a man.
38
2-GUN WESTERN
THE EVENING sped by while
Caleb dreamed and Ellen and Un-
cle Windmill spun their magic for
lonely gold seekers. It was near the
end of the program when Caleb made
his grevious error. Uncle Windmill,
fortifying .himself between scenes
with hot water and whiskey, had over-
done and become befuddled. When he
labored to a tortuous halt in mid-
speech, Caleb from far back in the
hall intoned, “...then must you
speak, of one that loved not wisely
but too well. ..”
  Uncle Windmill snorted dead cen-
ter, swung around and stared. Caleb
struggled to his feet in confusion and
scuffled out into the windy night.
  Caleb squatted three hours next
morning over the streambed and
panned a lucky ounce of gold and was
ignorant of just when Joe Salem ar-
rived to sit in the tree shade and
smoke and contemplate him.
  “You know them O'Fayes, don’t
you, Caleb,” Joe said finally. Caleb
nodded, sifting rhythmically at his
pan.
  "I figured so,” said Joe. “Else why
do we stop here and file a claim and
go down to a showing at the Dramatic
Hall...”
“I stop here,” said Caleb shortly.
“You can go where you please, Joe.”
“Why do you keep hid under your
hat and bush whiskers, Caleb? You
afraid of her?”
  Caleb stopped his sifting. He set
the pan down on a rock and looked
over at his companion. Joe, in some
special way, had become a part of
Caleb during their long trek north on
the Mother Lode. He'd become an
honest, dogged, goading thing which
at first followed and later drove Caleb
—like a conscience. He was prodding
now; too hard.
  "You think too much, Joe Salem.
Either pan gold or get out.”
  “The girl’s in trouble, Caleb. Her
and her uncle are in a claim fight
with a dude named Reno Cucci. He’s
about to beat them out.”
  Caleb picked up his pan again and
resumed sifting.
  “It’s a queer point,” Joe went on.
“Reno was working quartz ledges on
both sides of a little gulch. O'Faye
tracked a rich placer run in the
stream between the ledges and
claimed it. Cucci raised ned, of
course, and some of the boys think
he's mean, btot in his rights. Most
don't give a hoot.”
  “I don't give a hoot,” said Caleb.
“They say Ellen O’Faye brought
her uncle into the gold camps because
the stage was killin' him off. They
say if Reno takes this strike away
from him, it'll kill him sure. Don’t
seem just, somehow.”
  “Hold court and settle it,” Caleb
snapped.
  Joe got up and knocked the ashes
from his pipe. “They’re holding
court tomorrow night and Reno's al-
ready spending the gold he's gonna be
awarded.”
  Caleb sifted on, head bowed, still
searching his pan for the tell-tale glit-
ter. He was mightily relieved when
Joe Salem walked away.
iiTT’S NOT in my heart to dispos-
-»-sess a lady of such charm as Miss
O’Faye of any rightful claim she may
have on a fortune to match her fame,”
Reno Cucci was saying smoothly. The
late afternoon sun struck a lively
gleam in Reno’s over-large black eyes
and broad, toothy smile. He was a
big man sure in the knowledge of his
shrewdness and arresting good looks.
  “This matter of a placer strike her
uncle has made directly in the midst
of my quartz ledges can be easily
resolved,” he said.
  The men of Dogleg stirred and nod-
ded to one another and Temescal Mur-
phy, the presiding officer, looked
hugely comforted. To be caught in the
middle of a dispute between the adriot
and sinister Reno and a purposeful
woman like Ellen O'Faye was neither
pleasant nor healthful. Temescal was
a simple and honest man who was
well aware that a wrong move could
ruin him.
  Uncle Windmill, from across the
circle of men, cleared his throat.
“What is your purpose, sir—your of-
fer?” he said in his half-whisper.
  Reno shrugged, gesturing in comic
exaggeration with his large, flat
hands. “Ellen must marry me!”
  The miners howled with laughter.
They pounded knees, slapped hats to
the earth and jig-stepped. And Reno
grinned immensely.
FINAL CURTAIN
39
  "It’s the only answer,” one man
roared. “Marry ’em up, Temescal!”
  Uncle Windmill crossed the space
in three short jumps. His nose col-
lided agonizingly with Reno’s sud-
denly doubled fist. He shuddered,
groaned aloud and fell face-forward.
Ellen was down beside him swiftly
while Temescal took out his gun and
fired twice in the air to restore order.
  The sight of the girl there minister-
ing to the fallen O’Faye sobered the
men of Dogleg more effectively than
Temescal’s gunfire. Fun and hell are
fine, but no lady is treated like that.
  From the very midst of the crowd
suddenly stepped a newcomer to
camp, holding up his hands, demand-
ing attention. Joe Salem, a flushed
and angry man, addressed Temescal.
  “There’s a gent here who can talk
on this case,” he said loudly. “He’s a
man born with a nugget of sense—
which is worth more than all the gold
we’ll dig out of this hell-hole. I de-
mand he be heard. I refer to my pard-
ner standing over there.”
  Faces turned toward Caleb Hallo-
way and a path opened to where he
stood. Nervously, Caleb pulled his
hat brim low and straightened his
shoulders. He was painfully conscious
of Ellen, still kneeling beside Uncle
Windmill, but looking intently at
him. This was a shameful entrance
that was being forced upon him by
the treacherous Joe Salem.
  “Judge Halloway!” Joe Salem an-
nounced, burning all bridges behind
him.
  Temescal Murphy sought to assess
Caleb. “You know about this dispute
—Judge?” he said cautiously.
  Caleb nodded. There was the light
now of recognition in Ellen’s eyes.
There was the mouth opening slowly
in disbelief. And there was finally
an urgent and troubling cue for ac-
tion. Ellen’s cue pierced a wave of
such fright and dread as Caleb had
never experienced before. He knew
the sorry spectacle he made, but there
was no place to run or hide.
  "Dogleg’s a fair and just camp,” he
managed to say, pulling his eyes from
Ellen’s. His mind reached back fever-
ishly into his considerations of the
sleepless night before. He had gone
over Joe Salem's account of this dis-
pute minutely and somewhere he’d
caught a spark of light.
  “It’s been held in other camps—
according to common sense—that gold
digging is a franchise from the gov-
ernment, free to all,” he said.
  He paused to look around, let his
words sink in, to build some impact
on the crowd. “If Reno Cucci staked
a claim on quartz ledges, let him work
the quartz ledges.”
 He waited another moment and
looked down at Uncle Windmill. “If
William O’Faye staked a placer—
even in the very midst of the quartz
ledges—let him use that placer claim.”
There was a murmur and shuffling
of feet among the miners. They were
ripe now for any fair way out. The
girl kneeling down by her uncle there,
was a plumb embarrassing sight to
men instinctively chivalrous; and
then, too, this new fellow was talk-
ing sense.
  “I say this,” said Caleb, warming to
his subject, "if in that same gulch of
Reno Cucci and William O'Faye I
find a breeze that carries gold dust, I
should be allowed to stake a claim on
that breeze and strain gold from it
against all comers.”
  The final point immensely amused
and appealed to the men of Dogleg.
They forthwith and loudly voted
sanction of Uncle Windmill’s placer-
claim and hauled him victoriously to
the tent saloon for purposes of vigor-
ous revival. Temescal Murphy shout-
ed, “The dispute's settled,” and led
the way.
  But Reno Cucci stayed behind. He
intercepted Caleb on the way out of
camp. He drew the long knife fast,
with deadly purpose, but he never go*,
to use it. Joe Salem’s fist, from out of
nowhere, nearly pulverized an ear and
drove him senseless to the ground.
  "The law is good, but you got to
back it up, Caleb.” said Joe Salem,
grinning and rubbing at his big
knuckles. Then he noticed the girl
and promptly hustled toward the
gathering where Uncle Windmill’s
wits were being joyously resurrected.
  Ellen O’Faye said, “Judge Hallo-
way, as I live and breathe!” And there
was a tender mockery in her eyes as
she hurried toward him that purely
captured Caleb.	•END
DICK BAIRD
The victim wai directly in his sights.
MAN’S
HAND
 SHATTUCK was dead even be-
 fore he pitched from saddle. He
 lay sprawled on his back, staring
 up banjo-eyed at the starry sky that
 looked like silver studs holding in
 place a vast blue-black lid.
 Whoever had picked off
 Shattuck was a dead shot
 with a .30-30, and Sheriff
 Jep Parnell knew that the
 seven gunnies siding the
 killer would be equally
 handy with sixshooters...
  The big claybank nuzzled Shattuck
gently and tossed his head when the
man failed to move. Whinnying soft-
ly, the horse then turned and gal-
loped back the way he'd come—along
the winding bed of the Rake. The riv-
er was low—there had been little rain
in Sassafee Valley—and the clay-
bank's hoofs shot occasional sparks
as he pounded back toward Tonka
City.
  The Mineral Saloon was quiet, al-
most empty. Sheriff Jep Parnell
straightened in his chair and glanced
at the clock behind the bar. The
hands lacked five minutes till mid-
night. He threw down his cards and
stood up.
  “I don't like this business.” Parnell
  was tall, almost gaunt, and his gray
  eyes narrowed in their wide-set sock-
  ets. His blond hair was in sharp con-
  trast to the brown planes of his face.
  "Shattuck shouldn't have gone by
  himself.”
He stepped through the swinging
doors, and the three cattlemen still
seated at the table could hear the
clump of his heels on the planking
of the porch.

DEAD MAN'S HAND
41
  Keen Ralston sluiced a stream of
tobacco juice into the spittoon.
“Jep's worry in’ about nothin’. Been
itchy as a sand hen ever since Poler
dropped Johnny Thomas last week.
Hell's fire, Ben Poler ain't gonna
start another ruckus now. Jep, bein’
elected sheriff kind of set Ben back
on his heels. He knows Jep hasn’t
forgot about that fifty head he’s
missin’.”
  A startled look came into Ralston’s
eyes. He ran his thumb along the
gray stubble of his beard and fanned
his hand. Aces-and-eights. He looked
first at Cliff Bristow, and then at
Cliff’s brother, Jim. Neither spoke,
but Cliff quietly picked up the “dead
man's hand” and shuffled it into the
deck.
  The sound of running feet thudded
on the porch. A fair-cheeked youth
of seventeen or eighteen burst into
the room and fell against the table.
“Shattuck's horse just came in by it-
self,” he almost babbled, “and Sheriff
Parnell is goin’ out to look for him.
He says you all should go along.”
  Jep was already in the saddle when
Ralston and the Bristow brothers
hurried from the saloon. He was
checking his rifle, but no sign of
excitement or nervousness showed on
his angular face. He pulled the flat-
crowned Stetson low over his eyes.
  “Let's get going,” Parnell said to
the three. “Shattuck probably fol-
lowed the river, and unless I miss my
guess, that’s where we'll find him.”
He reined the black away from the
rail and flung over his shoulder:
“Then we’re going out to find Ben
Poler.”
  The three Bar K boys were right
behind him. They hit the end of the
street at a full gallop and didn’t slow
until they reached the banks of Rake
River. Jep held up his hand.
  “Ralston, you and I will follow the
bed. Cliff, you and Jim trail along
the bench, fifty yards apart. Keep
your eyes peeled.”
A BRIGHT three-quarter moon
and a sky full of stars aided the
search. They rode in silence; Jep
close to the edge of the river, Keen
Ralston near the rise of the bank,
and the Bristows spread out on the
shelf. The clop of hoofs and the oc-
casional clang of a shoe on a rock
was all that broke the silence. Twen-
ty minutes went by without a trace
of Shattuck.
  Mighty nice night to be lookin’
for a dead man, Jep said to himself.
Maybe he isn’t dead, though. Lots of
things could have happened.
  But he didn’t believe what he was
saying, and he snapped shut his
mouth in a thin hard line. He bent
forward in the saddle, and his gray
eyes drilled holes in the river’s edge.
  “Maybe he went down the other
side,” Keen's voice reached for him
through the stillness.
  “I don’t think so,” Jep answered.
“He'd just have to ford the river
farther up. No, I reckon he's on this
side of the Rake.”
  “How come he took off for Pome-
roy tonight? Even if one of Poler's
slicks did jump his claim, they ain’t
nothin’ he can do about it till morn-
ing. The courthouse won’t open till
eight or nine.”
  Jep rolled a cigarette. The glow of
the match cast a yellow flicker across
his lean, craggy face. "Probably fig-
ured he’d get the jump on Poler by
leaving tonight. Ben’s probably got
a stakeout on his place. Poler wants
that water bad.”
  “Well, Shattuck never made it.
Lookathere.” Jep pulled over, and
Keen’s gnarled finger pointed to
Shattuck’s body lying in the shadow
of the bank.
  Jep reined up. “Call Cliff and Jim.
Poler must be crazy. Shattuck never
harmed anybody. He was killed just
because he was sittin’ across Poler’s
creek—at least Ben called his creek
—and that gun-happy thief is loco
enough to pull the same job on any-
one who gets in his way.”
  Ralston whistled twice, and Cliff
Bristow’s shout answered. Keen’s
white hair caught the moon’s rays
as he held his hat and knelt beside
Shattuck's body.
  “Plumb between the eyes,” he said
in a low voice. “Never had a chance.
Looks like a .30-30 hole. Whoever
shot him must have meen waitin’ in
that outcropping over yonder.”
  Keen pointed toward the bank with
his hat, and Jep’s gaze followed.
Close to the edge of the shelf, at a
bend in the river, was a pile or rocks
which commanded an open view for
42
2-GUN WESTERN
200 yards upstream. Jep nodded and
headed for the rocks. Ralston and
the Bristow brothers sat down beside
Shattuck and waited for his return.
Only the sloshing of the river broke
the silence. They were thinking of
Len Conway and Mart Haskins and
Sheriff Thomas—and now Shattuck.
  Ralston threw a stone into the riv-
er. “Reckon I was wrong about Poler
layin’ quiet. Looks like we’ll have a
little set-to with the boys.” The pic-
ture of aces-and-eights came to his
mind. “And that's okay with me. No
tellin’ who cashes in on a dead man’s
hand.”
IN A FEW minutes Jep reappeared.
He held out his hand. In his palm
lay an empty .30-30 rifle shell. The
sheriff’s eyes swept the three men.
The granite hardness of his gaze
scraped against the steel edge of his
words.
  “This is Poler's work, sure as
blazes. Whoever killed Shattuck was
a dead shot, because Ben knew he
couldn’t take any chances on his get-
ting away. Who would you "say is the
best rifleman in Poler’s outfit?”
  Ralston spat against a white rock,
and watched the brown juice slide
down the side. “I reckon Deck Koog-
ler’s about it. I seen him knock the
spots off a trey last spring when he
won Curly Bettner's roan.”
  Parnell turned the shell in his
fingers. “I doubt that he would head
back to Poler’s tonight—too far and
too late. Chances are he’s holed up
someplace, either waiting for the oth-
ers, or fixin’ to head in later."
  “Ben’s got a line shack about eight-
nine miles from here. Sets in valley
couple miles west of the Rake.” Cliff
Bristow’s voice held a latent charge
at the thought of a showdown. “I’d
better lead the way. We'll go down
river a piece, then I know where to
cut off.”
  Jep nodded in agreement. He threw
a blanket over Shattuck. The tension
was mounting, and he knew he might
have put all of them into a heap of
trouble. Poler and his gunnies
wouldn’t be likely to wait and talk
first... Parnell kept his own coun-
sel. Plenty of time for such consider-
ations if the need arose; no telling
which way Ben would jump.
  The first gray streaks of morning
found Cliff Bristow calling a halt.
He turned in his saddle. "Poler’s cab-
in sets just over that ridge. We can
ride closer, but there’s a clearing all
around the cabin.”
  "We’ll go over the hill and get as
close as we can.” Jep’s voice was
clipped, and Ralston and the Bris-
tows knew he was in command again.
They rode over the rise and into the
pines covering the slope. A wisp of
smoke rose from the stone chimney.
Eight horses, saddled and ready,
stood at the side of the shack.
  “They're all inside,” Jep said as he
dismounted, “but we can't just walk
in and open up. We've got no real
proof that Ben had anything to do
with Shattuck’s death—even though
we do know it ourselves. We’ve got
to get him to show his hand.”
  Ralston and the Bristows spread
out and took cover behind the trees
and rocks. They could see both sides
of the cabin as well as the front. Jep
cupped his hands around his mouth
and shouted: “Poler, this is Sheriff
Parnell. We’ve got the drop on you,
so don’t try to run. I’ve come to take
you in for killing Shattuck.”
  Silence greeted him. For three
minutes no sound came from the cab-
in, then Poler’s voice boomed up the
side of the hill. "You got nothin’ on
me, Sheriff. I don’t know anything
about Shattuck or what’s happened
to him. I don’t aim to come out and
have your boys fill me full of holes.
We’re staying right here.”
  "He's stallin’ for time—trying to
size us up." Ralston's low growl
carried to Parnell’s ears. “Better
answer him, Jep.”
  Jep knew he had to gamble. He
stepped into the open and held his
hands away from his gun. “No use
wasting time, Ben. We found Shat-
tuck before he died, and he recog-
nized Deck Koogler’s horse and that
green jacket when he rode off. We
all heard him name you and Koogler.
Besides, I’ve got a .30-30 shell from
Koogler’s rifle."
  A rifle cracked and dirt spurted up
between Parnell’s feet. He fell back
and threw two quick shots at the cab-
in. The Bristow boys and Ralston
opened up as Jep reached the trees.
"There’s our answer,” Jep gritted.
DEAD MAN'S HAND
43
“Poler thinks we’ve got him dead to
rights. We’ll play hell taking him
alive without a tough fight. There
are likely eight men down there any-
way, and pretty soon he’ll know there
are only four of us.”
  A yell of pain and a rifle shot
pierced the air at almost the same
instant. "Three,” said Ken Ralston.
Cliff Bristow lurched from behind a
tree, his shoulder spurting blood, and
fell in a heap at his brother’s feet.
Jim tore open his shirt and began to
tend him. Jep and Ralston watched
from the corners of their eyes.
  Jim Bristow looked up. "I think
he'll be all right, but he won’t be
doin’ much shooting with that right
hand for a while. Damn that lousy
Poler and his slicks.” He punctuated
his words by emptying his sixgun at
the cabin.
THE SUN began to climb higher
in the sky. Both sides settled
down to await the other’s move. Only
spasmodic bursts of gunfire split the
stillness. Jep and the others kept
changing positions in an effort to
keep Poler from knowing how few
were pitted against him.
  "We won’t get anywhere this way,”
Jep said as the morning wore on.
“Pretty soon they’ll come bustin’ out
of there and either make a run for
it or spread out and try to finish us
off. Keen, I've got an idea. It’s a long
shot, but it just might be crazy
enough to work.”
  He rapidly outlined the plan to
Ralston and the Bristows. Jim
nodded and crept back to his horse.
  “Cliff, can you you throw lead with
your left hand?” Jep asked.
  “I can throw it,” Cliff replied, “but
I ain’t sayin’ what I can hit.”
  “You just keep pumping if you
have to. Ralston and I are going
down now to visit Ben. . . I’m com-
ing down to talk to you, Ben!” Jep
shouted. "Keep your boys off and
we’ll prevent a lot of bloodshed.”
"Come ahead, Sheriff, but keep
your hands up.”
  Keen Ralston began to crawl rapid-
ly in the brush to the cabin's flank.
A dusty road trailed from the clear-
ing off into the trees and up into the
hills. He worked as close to the road
as he could and still remain unseen.
Jep walked slowly toward the cab-
in, stopping ten yards before he
reached it. The door was opened wari-
ly, and Ben Poler, Deck Koogler and
a burly gunnie stepped out in the
morning sun.
  Poler stood with his legs spread
wide apart. “I’m listenin’, Sheriff,
but it had better be good. I know you
ain’t got but three men, and there’s
five more in the cabin right behind
us.”
  Jep spoke slowly, letting the words
sink in. He was playing for high
stakes, and if he lost this hand it
would be his last. "You’re wrong,
Ben. We've just been waiting you
out. Jim Bristow left long ago for
Pomeroy. He’ll be back any minute
with Sheriff Benton and a posse, and
a sworn statement that you and
Koogler killed Shattuck. I don’t fig-
ure they’ll feel much like playin’.
You’ve got just five minutes to sur-
render to me, or your boys will end
up in the same trouble as you and
Koogler. Surrender now and I’ll see
that you all get a fair trial.”
AN UNEASY shuffling and mut-
tering came from the cabin, for
Jep’s voice had carried as he’d in-
tended, to Poler’s men. They clearly
hadn’t counted on this play.
  "You’re bluffing, Jep.” Poler’s lips
were a bloodless line. He was trying
desperately to save his hide, but he
knew the sands were running out.
He glanced back at the cabin and
swallowed hard, his adam’s apple
running up and down the stubbied
column of his neck. “You know we
can blow our way out of here, and
you’ll go first.”
  “So you think I’m bluffing. Looi.;
there." Jep pointed to the road. Above
the line of trees and hills rose a fat
cloud of dust moving rapidly, such
as would be made by a large party of
riders pounding hell-for-leather
down the road.
  Poler swung his head around and
wet his lips. His eyes dilated with
fury and he stepped back, hand drop-
ping toward his gun. “Damn you,
Parnell,” he hissed, “if I’m goin’ to
hell I'm takin’ you with me.”
  Ben Poler’s Colt came up and
flame belched from the muzzle, but
Jep’s .44 crashed an instant before.
Poler's shot plowed into the dirt, and
44
2-GUN WESTERN
he sank to his knees as Jep’s slug
dug into his side. A third shot echoed
the others, and Deck Koogler's gun
fell from his fingers; Keen Ralston’s
shot carried Koogler’s tag. A smear
of blood grew larger on the gunman's
shirt front, and his coughs brought
red foam to his lips. The burly gun-
nie hadn’t moved, then he dropped
his sixgun and thrust his hands sky-
ward.
  ‘‘You’ve got about one minute,” Jep
shouted to the men in the cabin. He
pointed to Poler who still knelt in
the dirt, the blood oozing from be-
tween his fingers. "Throw out your
guns and come out with your hands
up or you’ll get it just like Ben and
Koogler did."
  The rest of Poler’s bunch had lost
their stomachs for a fight. Revolvers
and rifles were thrown through the
door and windows, and Poler’s five
slicks came in a sullen file into the
clearing. Their eyes burned with
hatred for both Jep and Poler, and
one kicked at his late leader. Keen
Ralston, grinning in his gray whisk-
ers, took up the slack space behind
Ben and his boys.
  “Here comes your posse, Ben.” Jep
waved his gun toward the road as
Jim Bristow charged into the little
valley on his leathered bay. Behind
him dragged the limb of a tree, the
branches bobbing crazily, and clouds
of dust rising from the few remaining
leaves.
  A violent curse spurted from Ben
Poler’s lips and he tried to rise. An
angry growl rose from his slicks, but
they knew it was too late to make a
NOON TOMORROW
was held up by the bar and for a
minute his cold eyes glared at Jim.
Blood was running from the wound
over his heart and his left hand
started up as though to staunch it.
But death caught him then and his
eyes dulled and he pitched forward
and hit on his face. He didn’t move
again.
 There was a moment's silence,
while the shock of the noise made by
the crashing guns wore off. Then
Monty Ferris ran around the bar,
grabbed Jim's hand and shook it
violently. "You did it, kid, you did
it. I thought you were a goner; how
move. Jim Bristow was covering them
from his horse, and Cliff, his right
arm hanging limp, had made his way
down from the pines.
  A new calmness showed in Jep's
face. “You fell for an old army trick,
Ben. Jim raised a lot of dust draggin’
that tree limb, and you thought it
was the posse from Pomeroy. Don’t
worry though, we’ll see that you get
a tree limb—all legal and on the table.
The people in Tonka City are mighty
tired of the way you've been prod-
ding this territory for five years. Tie
them up, Jim, and we’ll head back
for Tonka.”
  It was almost twelve when Jep
Parnell, the Bristow brothers and
Keen Ralston stopped before the
Tonka City jail and hustled Ben
Poler and his boys inside. Deck
Koogler hung face downward across
the saddle, a trail of blood marking
the path that led back to Rake River.
A dozen hands helped Cliff into the
doctor’s office.
  “Drinks on me, boys,” Jep flung
at Ralston and Jim Bristow, and led
the way into the Mineral Saloon.
“Cliff can collect his later, after the
doc patches up that shoulder.”
  The batwing doors swung shut be-
hind them, and the three sank weari-
ly into their chairs. Keen Ralston
idly picked up a deck of cards, grim-
ly remembering the dead man's hand.
Jep Parnell looked at the clock be-
hind the bar, it was just noon, exact-
ly twelve hours since Shattuck's clay-
bank had come in by itself.
  Ralston’s long fingers started deal-
ing automatically.	«EhtD
      (cont'd from page 33)
did you ever beat him?”
  "He beat himself. He let me get
him mad and he fired wild. Always
before he stayed cool and the other
man got mad. This time he wasn't
fightin’ for pay and he blew it. I was
countin’ on that.”
  Jim turned and walked from the
saloon. On the walk outside he
remembered the gun which was still
in his hand. He dropped it back in
holster and started down the street,
hurrying now, seeing Nell running
toward him. He had something to
ask her and it suddenly was very
urgent.	#END

 GRINNELL reached Colfax
 County after ten days of hard
 riding. After leaving Lassiter
 lying in the streets of Bend he had
 ridden east and south as if heading
 for Nevada, then he had turned north
 of Baker toward the Grande Ronde
 and Idaho. Here again he had changed
 direction and crossed into Washing-
 ton near Walla Walla. Not daring to
 cross on the ferry at Alpowa, he had
 swum his horse across the treacherous
 What a gun was in his
 hand, Grinnell was in the

 called him evil, from
 Dodge City to Death Val-
 ley, but it was a brand
 that doubtless should
 have been blotted....

2-GUN WESTERN
Snake River near the mouth of the
Palouse.
  Here, in the badlands near Palouse
Falls, he could go no further. He had
not eaten in four days and had barely
slept in ten. The bullet Town Mar-
shal Lassiter had put through his side
just above the belt had left a foul
passage which had corrupted until
his whole left side was bathed in fire
at every jolt of the rawboned bronco
he had stolen in the Grande Ronde.
  The horse, battered by the long fast
miles and the terrible struggle of the
Snake crossing, was nearly gone.
Grinnell was reaching the end of the
road, driven by the fate which had
goaded him without let-up for all
his forty-odd years. The cards were
shuffled and dealt, all he could do
was as he’d always done, play out the
hand.
  All he’d ever been, from the begin-
ing, when he’d been lost from a wag-
on-train, was the tool of fate. What
a gun was in his hand, he was in the
hand of destiny. They called him evil,
in all the West from Dodge City to
Death Valley. But evil was not a word
that applied to him. The fate that
pushed him was a brutal thing, cruel
and heartless. Grinnell simply did
what he had to do.
  He rode on, his battered horse
plodding head down, into a gray and
shimmering world of sagebrush and
stunted jackpines. Far off in the
distance he could see the blue of a
pot-hole lake in a coulee. Water
wouldn’t fill the emptiness in his
belly, but it might get some of the
grime from him.
  He let the horse drink first, and
thirsty as it was, it snorted at the
brackish alkaline water. Where the
tiny waves of the lake beat against
the shore there was a foam like soap-
suds. The water would eat the bottom
from a tin cup in a year, but it was
sweet enough for cattle to drink.
  It was when he rose from dipping
his face in the lake that he saw the
house. It was set back in the wall of
a grassy chute leading into the coulee
from the prairie above. Its front was
of pine logs daubed with clay and its
back was the wall of the chute. It was
half a dugout, half a house. The logs
were still shiny, reflecting newness.
A homesteader's wagon: a big Stude-
baker with a tent built on it, was
pulled to one side. The pain of an
empty belly twisted Grinnell. The
homesteader might shoot him on sight
but he could go no further without
food, even if he had to get it at gun-
point.
THERE WAS a child playing near
the wagon, he saw now, and an
obscure impulse made him turn back
to the lake and scrub his face in the
stinging alkali water. He got a broken
mirror and razor from his blanket roll
and set about the painful job of scrap-
ing his face free of the twelve day
beard. There wasn’t much he could do
about a face that would scare the
devil himself. Slowly he remounted
and rode around the end of the lake.
  The child, a boy about nine,
stopped shooting at Indiana with a
stick gun when Grinnell rode up and
stood painfully still, his bright eyes
taking in the rifle in the saddle boot
and the Colt hung dragon style on
Grinnell’s left hip.
  Grinnell sat his horse, as was prop-
er in this country until invited to get
down. “Your pa home, boy?”
  The boy’s eyes flickered toward the
horizon and in that glance Grinnell
saw that the man of the family was
gone. The boy set his jaw and said
nothing.
  “What is it, Jesse?’’ a woman
called.
  Grinnell turned in the saddle and
saw her standing in the leather
hinged doorway, a pretty woman, not
yet thirty, with blue eyes and blond*
hair, both already starting t« fade
from sun and wind and loneliness.
Beside her, within easy reach, h*
could see the blued barrels of a shot-
gun.
  “What is it?” she repeated sharply.
“Are you one of Bayer's riders?”
  Grinnell touched the greasy brim of
his hat. “No ma'am, I’m a stranger in
these parts, and nearly starved. I’d
take it a most kindly act if you’d sell
me some vittles.”
  Her eyes went over him and Grin-
nell could again see the image he had
seen in the broken mirror accoss the
lake. A dirty, scar-faced man with
blood spots from fresh shaving on his
mottled gray skin. Protruding un-
LAST CARD

blinking eyes and a spade shaped head
like a diamond-back rattler.
  “I mean you no hurt, ma'am,” he
said. “I’m desperate hungry.”
  She nodded at last. “Step down. I’ve
something left from Jesse's dinner.”
Grinnell dismounted slowly and
carefully, so as to not alarm her.
The boy, Jesse, was still regarding
him with the distrust of people who
live lonely lives. But he was taken by
the gunbelt on Grinnell and it would
not be long before he made some
friendly overture. Grinnell had no
feeling for children, he could not re-
member having been one himself;
when he had been this boy’s age, he
had been driving with a freighting
outfit.
  Out of long habit his eyes searched
the surrounding screen of coulee
walls before he hunkered down to
wait for the food. He was a long way
from Missouri River bottom land
where he had started and still every-
thing was the same. He was hungry,
dirty, and still wary of the kick which
would come if he wasn’t fast on the
dodge.
  Over the years he had acquired a
name—his last from a freighter who
had picked him off the streets of St.
Louis—the first, Slick, had been ac-
quired in Abilene when he had
dropped a tough Texas rancher with
a hideout .41 derringer. The thing
that went with the name Slick Grin-
nell, a reputation for fast and deadly
and cold-blooded murder, had been
acquired in a dozen tough places.
Even the woman in there might have
heard of Slick Grinnell. If she knew
who he was, he would have been
covered with the shotgun from the
time he rode on the place.
The woman came to the door again.
“Come in and set down, it ain't much
but it’ll keep body and soul together.”
“I can eat out here, ma’am,” Grin-
nell said.
  “Sit down at the table,” she said.
GRINNELL went in and sat
down at a table made of split
logs. Soft wood; cottonwood, he saw.
It would soon fall apart. He had seen
these homesteaders move in on the
rim of cattle ranches before. They
came stubbornly seeking out their
hundred-sixty acres of land, worked
like demons night and day, and in
two or three years went on to another
bright promise, leaving decaying
buildings and home-made furniture
like this behind them.
  It irritated him always: the people
with their hopes and dreams pitting
themselves against insurmountable
odds. There was no use pitying them;
they would not listen to reason.
  The woman put a steaming plate of
beans and some cold corn bread in
front of him. The faint odor of mo-
lasses tinted the smell of the beans,
turning Grinnell weak and ravening.
He seized his knife and began to
scoop up the beans, shoveling them
into his mouth in a steady stream. He
did not slow down until all the beans
were gone, then he sopped up the
remaining juice on his plate with the
cornbread.
  The boy was staring at him wide-
eyed. “Maw,” he said in an urgent
voice. “He eats with his knife J”
“Hush, Jesse,” the woman said,
embarrassed.
  “I bet he’s one of Bayer's riders.
They’re all hogs.”
  “Jesse! I’m sorry, mister. It's pret-
ty hard to strap manners into a wild
boy.”
  Grinnell smiled, a remote bleak
flicker of expression. “Nobody
learned me better'n to eat with a
knife until I was too old to change.”
He was acutely embarrassed for some
reason, and wanted to change the sub-
ject. “Who is this Bayer?”
  "This land used to be Indian Re-
serve,” the woman said. “Bayer used
to pay the Indians a dollar an acre to
herd his cattle on here. Now the gov-
ernment has thrown it open for
filing, and Bayer wants to keep it.
He's brought in all the hardcases they
have run out of Lewiston and Walla
Walla.”
 “They've got a sheriff in the
county, ain't they?” Grinnell asked.
  "Sheriff!” she said scornfully.
“Bayer's own man. The county com-
missioners are all cattlemen. When
the old sheriff died the commission-
ers appointed this new man.”
  “I see,” Grinnell said. A sheriff was
the last man he wanted to see. He
rose and tilted his hat forward over
his eyes again. He was feeling the
old irritation at helpless people who
4S
2-GUN WESTERN
did not believe they were helpless.
There was no hope for these people.
Lately, in Wyoming, he’d hired out
his gun to the cattlemen fighting back
a wave of settlers. The fight had been
bloody, and the homesteaders beaten.
Here, with a handpicked sheiiff, the
homesteaders had no chance at all.
They could not fight the run of the
cards.
  He reached in his pocket for a half-
eagle. He shook his head at the wom-
an’s quick protest. “For feeding a
stranger, even if you was afraid.”
  The boy walked to his horse with
him. Jesse’s eyes were on the bone
handle of the pistol. “You like guns,
boy?”
  “I got a dollar,” the boy said. “You
want to sell that gun, mister?”
  “Afraid I couldn’t get along with-
out it,” Grinnell said. “What do you
need a gun for?”
  “Maybe the Indians will come
snooping around. I could shoot Bayer
and his whole gang of mangy riders,
too!”
  Grinnell chuckled. “You save that
fight, boy, you may need it.”
  He looked down at the house when
his horse had climbed to the top of
the grassy chute. Again he felt irri-
tated at their helpless stubbornness.
Bayer and his handpicked riders
would force them to move, and they
would go on and on, pushed by the
same bitter fate that pushed him.
BY NIGHTFALL he had ridden
several miles to the north without
seeing another human being. The des-
ert had given way to the deep soil of
the Palouse hills and the wild grass,
rolling in the wind, brushed at his
hips as he rode through. At sundown
a sage hen ran through the grass be-
fore him, dragging a wing in imitation
injury. Grinnell took a quick glance
at one of the balls of fluff which were
her chicks, decided they were old
enough to fend for themselves, and
blew off her head with his forty-four.
  Before dark he descended to the
Palouse River, gathered a few limbs
and roasted the sage hen on a stick.
The meat was tough and stringy and
tasted strongly of sage. Supper over,
he untied his horses’ picket rope from
a sage and retied it to his wrist. Then
he lay with his head on the saddle,
covering himself with the stinking
saddle blanket, and with his pistol in
his hand, fell into a profound sleep.
  He was awakened some time later,
about midnight, he judged by the
slow wheel of stars, to the sound of
a half-dozen horses trotting some-
where up on the coulee rim. He lay
tensed, head lifted, with his pistol
cocked, until the sound of the horses
died out in the distance.
  He awoke again in the first silver
light of dawn with the sharp feeling
that something had gone wrong. He
did not move, other than to put his
thumb over the pistol hammer.
 “You can quit playing possum,
Slick. Right now you’re cold turkey,”
a faintly amused voice said.
  Grinnell sat up slowly, tilting the
gun barrel toward the sound of the
voice as he did so.
  “Don’t try it.”
  Grinnell pulled his hand from un-
der the blanket. "Shorty Morcross,”
he said. “Ain't seen you since Wyo-
ming.”
  The short man sitting in the saddle,
with the carbine centered on Grin-
nell’s chest, grinned with mirth. “The
name is Dyke, Ted Dyke, Slick.
Shorty Morcross never got out of
Wyoming.” He pointed to his chest.
“Ted Dyke is sheriff of Colfax
County.”
  Grinnell shook his head as if to
clear it. “I must be asleep, Shorty. I
thought you said sheriff.” His mind
was busy with the play. If there was
big enough reward posted for him in
Oregon, Shorty wouldn’t waste much
time before shooting.
  “Slick,” Shorty said. "You’re in a
mighty bad spot.”
  Grinnell said nothing, tensing his
muscles for a try at his gun. It would
be useless. Shorty was no amateur,
and he could put three bullets
through him before he got his hand
under the blanket.
  "Colfax County used to be tough,”
Shorty said. “Right now they’re look-
ing over every strange rider that
comes in. Generally, they issue a
request to keep on riding.’”
  Grinnell sat straighter, trying to
postpone the moment when Shorty
would pull the trigger.
  Don’t reach for that gun, Slick! I

could start even and still beat you.
I'm giving you a good chance. We
might just forget we ever saw each
other before. Your name is maybe
Jake Brown. I can use a good deputy
for a month or so.”
  “New way of livin’ for me,” Grin-
nell said. Relief poured through him
like pure, sweet water. “You got a
dodger on me, Mr. Dyke?”
  “No. Probably get it a couple of
days after you ride out. I'm surprised
at you, Slick. In the old days a man
couldn’t get within a mile of where
you was sleeping.”
  “We all get old,” Grinnell said.
"For a minute there I thought I
wasn’t going to get any older. The
people of this county know what kind
of lawdog they got?”
  Shorty smiled his mirthless gri-
mace. “Only one person in this county
whose opinion is worth a damn. His
name is Bayer, big rancher. We’ll ride
by his ranch on the way to town.”
 I	never knowed the time you
needed help, Shorty.”
  “A man can’t have eyes everywhere.
These homesteaders will fight for
this rich land. Some of them are
pretty tough. You might say you're
insurance for me, just like I'm insur-
ance for Mr. Bayer. Let’s ride, Depu-
ty.”
BAYER’S ranch was on a hill over-
looking the river. Grinnell, when
the horses splashed across the shallow
ford, saw a blacksmith hard at work
in the shop, a rifle leaning against the
forge. Three men were working at
the corral, repairing cinch straps, but
behind them were three more rifles,
new, from their appearance. The
house itself was set back against the
hill, and was made of fieldstone heav-
ily mortared together. The full length
porch commanded a view of the en-
tire valley. Behind the house, up on
the rim, more riders were hazing
eome horses. The Bayer's ranch was
set for trouble. It would take a small
army to get at Bayer.
  One of the men at the corral had
stopped hammering rivets into a strap
and was carefully inspecting his rifle
as Shorty and Grinnell rode up.
Shorty jerked a thumb at Grinnell.
“New deputy, name of Jake Brown,”
he said. “Parker Nichols, foreman of
the Bar B, Jake. Bayer at home?”
 “Up at the cookshack, getting
breakfast. If the cook is in a good
mood maybe you can get some grub,
too.”
  Bayer, a heavy, red-faced man of
forty, was seated alone in the cook-
shack. “Mornin’, Sheriff,” he said.
“Who’s your boy?”
  “This side of the line his name is
Jake Brown.”
  Bayer speared a slice of ham. “He
ain’t very pretty. Is he useful?”
“He’ll get the job done.”
  Bayer’s cold gaze rested on Grin-
nell. “You boys represent the law. I
want the homesteaders off the Indian
Strip. I don’t want a federal marshal
down here nosing around afterward.
If you’re wanted in other states, get
the job done and get out of here.”
He turned back to his ham and eggs.
 “How about some breakfast, Mr.
Bayer?” Shorty asked.
 “Don’t anybody ever eat before
they come out here? Plates are on
the side table.”
  Grinnell was famished again. The
meal he had got at the homesteader’s
and the sage hen he had eaten the
night before had barely taken a wrin-
kle out of his hunger. He loaded a
plate with the ham and eggs and filled
a mug with coffee from the back of
the big range. The ham was beginning
to dry out and the eggs were greasy
cold, but he grabbed a knife and be-
gan to take the slack from his empty
stomach.
  Bayer pushed his chair back and
stood up. Grinnell, stopping to refill
his coffee cup, noted he wore choke-
bore riding pants and hand-tooled
boots and that he carried a short-
barreled gun in a specially tailored
hip pocket.
  Bayer grimaced at Shorty. “Your
friend may be a curly wolf, but he
eats like a hog. Next time, feed him
outside; he turns my stomach.”
Shorty laid a lightning-fast hand on
Grinnell's arm. “Take it easy, Slio-k,”
he said.
  Bayer stared at Grinnell with con-
tempt, but Grinnell could see the
nervous flicker of his eyes.
  Outside they mounted and turned
their horses up the valley toward Pal-
ouse City. Shorty seemed worried by
50
2-GUN WESTERN
Grinnell's silence. “Hell, I wouldn’t
let what Bayer said bother me,” he
said. “He’s been top dog in this coun-
try a long time; he just didn't know
who he was talking to.”
  Grinnell turned his bleak gaze on
him. “Don't worry about Bayer,” he
said. “I never kill anybody unless I'm
paid for it.”
EARLY EVENING filled the valley
around Palouse City with plum-
colored light when Grinnell awak-
ened from an afternoon's sleep. After
riding into town, he had checked in
at Shorty’s office, and then had bed-
ded down in one of the bunks in the
back of the livery barn. Now he went
to the barber shop and bought a hot
bath in which he soaked the grime
from his body and some of the poison
from the bullet gouge in his side. The
wound looked purple and poisonous,
he should have had a doctor look at
it. His dirt-encrusted clothing felt
strange after the bath, so he sent a
boy to the store for new overalls and
a shirt. He put them on and had a
close shave and haircut. Then he
sauntered on to supper smelling
strongly of new clothing and bay rum.
  His steak and apple pie eaten, he
went back to the courthouse to re-
port to Shorty. There were two other
deputies: Walters, a blowhard who
would crack in a tight; and a heavy-
shouldered man named Spear, who
had been the town marshal. A good
man for shouldering drunks out of
the way, but too slow-witted to be a
gunfighter. Grinnell pegged him as
the man to rough the homesteaders
when they were in town.
  “Here’s the deal,” Shorty said.
“You, Spear, and Walters patrol the
town. Some of Bayer’s riders will be
in. They’ll be tough with homestead-
ers. Most of the farmers won’t fight.”
He grinned. “They're married men,
with wives and families, they can't af-
ford to fight. But there are always
one or two young bucks who think
they're tough, or have to impress their
lady friends. Those are the men we’ll
leave to Jake Brown. That clear?”
  The night shadows were as thick
and black as boiled coffee wherever
the yellow lamplight did not reach.
Grinnell stolidly walked the length of
the street to where the two branches
  of the Palouse flowed together. The
creeks rustled faintly over the stones,
and he was surprised to hear a boom-
ing rush as of a'waterfall. It took him
minutes of listening before he re-
alized the sound was of the wind
rushing over acres and acres of head-
high grass up on the rim. This Pal-
ouse soil, he realized, if it grew grass
that tall, would grow wheat beyond
any farmers’ wildest dream. He did
not know how long Bayer could hold
back the farmers from the country.
It would not be long. It was only the
first homesteaders who would suffer;
those who came after would find
courts and churches and impartial
sheriffs. It was inevitable, as inevi-
table as the fate which would lead the
bolder of them to die in the streets of
Palouse under his guns. The west-
ward settlements were the same al-
ways, repeated and repeated and re-
peated.
  Grinnell wheeled and paced up the
crooked street to its final turning to
the road to Lewiston. It was quiet to-
night. but tomorrow was Saturday.
The homesteaders and Bayer’s hands
would be in town. Bayer and Shorty
were set for violence, and he was the
gun in their hands.
  It would take a cool hand and
steady nerves. A professional gun-
fighter he did not fear, there it was a
question of nerve and hairline guess-
ing about another man’s reactions. It
was the amateurs he had to worry
about. Some farmer who never before
had a gun in his hands might be
lucky. He went back to the livery
stable and rolled into his bunk.
E AWOKE to a cloudless Satur-
day morning with an ache in all
his joints and the coppery taste of
fever in his mouth. The ease and well-
being he felt the afternoon before had
left him. His motions were sluggish
and his head ached steadily.
  He inquired of a boy the where-
abouts of a doctor, and the boy
pointed to a house four doors away..
The doctor, an untidy man with the
stains of his morning coffee on his
shirtfront, was seated on the porch
absorbing the sunshine.
  The doctor took a quick glance at
the wounded side, then looked at
Grinnell’s eyes and checked his pulse.
LAST CARD
51
  “My friend, you’re in bad shape,”
he said. "You do any more riding with
that wound, and you’ll fall off your
horse for good. You better stay here
in town and get yourself a homestead
out on the Indian Strip. You lie
around for a month doing nothing,
then you can prove your homestead.
You've got a lot of poison in your
system.”
  "Is it that easy to get a homestead?”
Grinnell asked.
  "Why not? This country’s got a
great future—a great future. You got
time to see the garden I’ve planted in
back?”
  “Some other time, Doc.” Grinnell
paid the doctor his fifty cents. He
was remembering the homesteader's
place by the pothole lake. A nice
place to stop and let the rest of his
years run out. A place like that—or
that place, after he and Shorty had
moved the homesteader’s family on.
As long as Bayer and Shorty were in
power in the country he would be
safe, and he could help keep them in
power.
  His headache was worse, he wished
that he had dared ask the doctor
for some painkiller, but a dose of
laudanum would make him too slow
and draggy for the business at hand.
He took a seat on the bench in front
of the main store, not far from the
hitchrack, which was already lined
with horses wearing Bayer’s Cross B
brand. Out at the end of the street
there were three farm wagons, the
horses unhitched and munching hay
from the wagon boxes.
  After a time Bayer rode into town
with his foreman, Nichols. He tied his
high-stepping Kentucky horse to the
hitch-rack, took a quick hard look at
Grinnell, then went across the street
to the Pastime. In three minutes,
Shorty, the sheriff’s star gleaming on
his chest, strolled down the street
and disappeared into the saloon after
Bayer. Further down Grinnell could
see Spear and Walters patrolling.
  The cards were shuffled and dealt.
The hand was ready to be played out.
The farmers would push into the
stacked deck. They would blam« Bay-
er and Shorty and Grinnell, not
knowing that they, too, were merely
players uselessly playing the hands
they got.
  Near ten o’clock two wagons came
into town from downriver. The first
one held the woman and the boy,
Jesse, who had fed him by the pothole
lake. The man holding the reins was
tall and dark-haired, with bulky
shoulders and a tough, square set to
his jaw. He drove directly to the
hitch-rack. He stepped down, untied
Bayer’s fiddlefooted Kentucky horse,
and moved it up the rack to make
room for his team.
  The damned fool, Grinnell thought,
he’s pushing himself harder than
he has to. If he ran maybe he could
get out of it alive. He’s got the wife
and the boy to think about.
  But then he thought wearily: What
difference will it make? The pride
would ride with the farmer wherever
he went, and the woman had probably
been attracted to him because of it.
What had made her a wife might
make her a widow. If not here, then
somewhere else.
GRINNELL felt a moment's admir-
ation for the farmer, then again,
pity. No matter how brave a show he
made of it, he was beat.
  The two young farmers, brothers,
by their look, in the wagon behind
had driven directly to the hardware
store. One of them held the team
while the other went inside. Grinnell
saw Spear and Walters bearing down
on the wagon, and the play was clear
in his mind. He had seen it a hundred
times before, in a hundred different
ways. Different, but always the same.
Bayer must have decided that these
two and the broad-shouldered married
farmer were the kingpins who must
be driven out or killed.
  Spear and Walters wheeled in con-
cert and sat down on the bench in
front of the hardware store. The
farmer, a red-headed, fair-skinned
Swede, glanced at them, then returned
to his moody contemplation of the
dashboard.
  From where he sat Grinnell could
not hear what Spear and Walters
were saying, but it was apparent they
were enjoying it. The farmer’s face,
already sun-reddened, turned a bright
scarlet. The sound of Spear’s un-
melodious bray drifted up the street.
  Just as the other brother appeared
in the doorway with a gunny-sack of
52
2-GUN WESTERN
supplies the farmer in the wagon
dived between his feet and came up
with a rifle. He was fast, the carbine
was halfway to his shoulder before
Spear and Walters could get un-
tracked. Walters made an ineffective
grab for his gun as Spear bumped the
man in the door.
  Grinnell hurled himself to his feet
and drew his pistol in the same mo-
tion. It was an impossibly long shot
for a pistol, but he sighted and fired.
The shot was high. The heavy slug
caught the farmer in the shoulder and
knocked him from the wagon seat. He
fell between the wagon-box and
wheel, which saved his life. Walters
had finally got his gun clear of its
holster. Spear had pinioned the arms
of the brother.
  “Hold it!” Grinnell shouted. He
plodded down the street to them, feel-
ing the steady throb of his fevered
blood behind his eyes.
  Walters was looking down at his
gun, a foolish smile on his face. Spear
looked stunned, as if what had been a
rude game had suddenly exploded be-
yond belief. The farmer Spear had
grabbed, slammed himself free with
his elbows and went to assist his
brother.
  There was a quick rustle of skirts
as the homesteader's wife ran to the
wounded man.
  “Axel! Are you all right?”
  Axel grimaced from pain. “Smashed
a shoulder.”
  “Doctor up the street,” Grinnell
said. “Get your shoulder fixed and
either get out of Colfax County or
go on trial for assaulting a peace
officer.”
  The woman turned on him. “So you
are one of Bayer's pet curs! I’m
sorry I wasted food on you the other
day! I should have fed it to the hogs.
There's no reason for a man like you
living.”
  Grinnell looked at her blankly.
  Shorty strutted over importantly
from the Pastime. "A little trouble,
Jake?”
  “Our friend went for Spear and
Walters with a rifle. I had to cool him
off.”
  Shorty looked, not at the brothers,
but at the farmer’s wife. “We are giv-
ing you the same orders we give all
troublemakers in Colfax County. Get
your wagon rolling and don't stop
this side of the line.”
  “So that’s it,” she said. “We move
out, and tomorrow you or some other
dog of Bayer’s files on our land. Why
bother pretending it’s legal? Why
not kill us outright?”
  “Lady, you’ve heard what I have to
say,” Shorty said. The woman turned
away, tears streaking the faint layer
of dust on her face. Grinnell, watch-
ing her, saw the boy Jesse standing a
few feet away, his eyes wide and
frightened. Well, it was a tougli world
and the boy might as well learn it now
as later. Jesse reached out and took
his mother’s hand as they trailed back
to the wagon.
  Grinnell, his head floating from
fever, watched the husband running
to them. The woman went to his arms,
while the boy Jesse stood close, not
understanding the violence which
outstripped his wildest dreams of
Indian battles.
  The farmer finally pushed his wife
away and wheeled toward the Pas-
time. It was then Grinnell saw the
pistol stuck in the waistband of his
overalls.
  Bayer and Nichols were watching
from the saloon door. The last card
had been played, the last part of the
design put in. It was exactly as Grin-
ell had known it would go. There was
no escape.
  “Use that rifle, Slick,” Shorty
called.
  Grinnell lifted the rifle, and in that
moment rebellion overtook him. It
was his chance to spit in the eye of
destiny.
  “Shorty, you always thought you
was faster than me. Now's the time to
find out.”
  Shorty looked, not understanding.
  “I'm changing sides, Shorty.”
  Shorty had his gun clear of the
holster and half-raised when Grin-
nell’s-bullet hit him in the throat.
  Grinnell whirled on Walters and
Spear. "Stay out of this or you’re
dead,” he said. He leveled the carbine.
  His first shot lifted a spout of dust
in front of the farmer. His second
shot jerked the batwing door to the
right of Bayer. The rancher and
Nichols turned and dived into the
saloon.

ROTTEN BELLY’S SAD SIEGE
by NOEL M. LOOMIS
Rotten belly was one of
the great chiefs of the Crows.
A savage fighter, friendly to-
ward the whites, and of unquenchable
pride and spirit, he was forced by his
tribe into an adventure for which he
had no heart, and at the end he told
his people to keep peace with the
white man forever after...
  Rotten Belly first appears in 1825,
when he met General Henry Atkin-
son at one of the Mandan villages.
  Congress had passed a law to au-
thorize treaties with the tribes on the
Missouri River, and President Monroe
appointed a commission headed by
Atkinson. The commission established
headquarters at one of the Mandan
villages in what is now western North
Dakota, and sent out runners to the
surrounding tribes,
inviting them to
come to the village
to make treaties.
There would of
course be gifts in
celebration, and
medals to be hung
around the necks
of the chiefs.
There would be
many pipes
smoked, and per-
haps a few surrep-
titious nips at the
bottle.
  The normal headquarters of the
Crows was somewhat west of the
Mandans, but they sent a delegation
headed by Rotten Belly, who was
then about thirty-six years old, tall,
dignified, of splendid physique, ad-
mired for his unquestioned bravery,
and considered quite humane for a
man raised under savage conditions.
  Atkinson’s effort was successful,
for he concluded a treaty with the
Crows on August 4, and it is interest-
ing to note that the United States
promised not to furnish arms to any
enemies of the Crows. Inasmuch as
the Crows fought the Blackfeet, the
Shoshones, the Assiniboines, the
Gros Ventres, and from time to time
practically every other tribe in the
area, it would seem to pose a problem
in administration—especially so since
similar treaties were also made with
the other tribes.
  The story of the siege of Fort Mc-
Kenzie, the farthest northwest out-
post in the United States (for at that
time the west coast was Spanish and
British) begins in April, 1834, when
a party of three Blood (Blackfeet)
warriors and one squaw came to the
fort, announcing themselves as a war
party headed for Crow country on a
horse-stealing expedition.
 Major Alexander Culbertson, in
charge of Fort McKenzie, talked them
out of the idea, and they started back.
The fort was pro-
visioned, guns
cleaned, balls
poured, a guard
established. And
then the savage
Crows came thun-
dering in, armed to
the teeth . . .
But a few miles north, thirty Crows
rode down upon them as they were
enjoying a smoke, and with their con-
centrated fire killed two of the braves
and wounded the third.
 The wounded Blood, however,
knocked a Crow from his horse with
a single sweep of his rifle, leaped on
the horse, seized a lance, and gal-
loped away. He was fortunate in hav-
ing taken an unusually good horse,
and so he reached the fort, but the
squaw, who was his sister, was still
in the hands of the Crows.
 The Crows rode hard toward the
south, guarding the squaw with care.
Her clothing was taken away from
53
54
2-GUN WESTERN
her at night, and she was forced to
sleep with a Crow squaw who awoke
at the lift of an eyelash. The Blood
woman had no chance to escape until
she was several days away. Then a
storm came up one night and she es-
caped. She found herself in an enemy
country, without food or weapons,
and completely naked. She traveled
five days under a blazing sun and
through rugged mountains where
water froze at night, back toward the
fort.
TyjAJOR CULBERTSON, guided
IVi. by the squaw's brother, had re-
turned to the scene of the tragedy and
recovered the bodies for burial. Then
one evening he saw movement in the
brush on the opposite side of the riv-
er. He crossed in a rowboat, and to his
amazement found the squaw who had
been taken away by the Crows. She
was naked except for bunches of sage-
brush tied on her body; her feet were
cut and bleeding from the long days
of hard travel through stones and
prickly pear cactus, and she was gaunt
from exposure, weariness, and hun-
ger.
  Culbertson took her across the river
to the fort, gave her food and cloth-
ing, and was astonished to hear her
say that the Crows were preparing a
heavy attack against the fort, with the
intention of destroying it. This was
the attack made against Rotten Bel-
ly’s desire, and it is necessary to un-
derstand the Indians’ practice. When
a brave becomes a war leader, he is
to some extent subject to the wishes
of the tribe. He may decline to lead
them on some raids, but if the senti-
ment of the tribe is strong he cannot
so decline without losing face, and
most Indian warriors would go to cer-
tain death rather than lose standing.
 A band of Crows drove thirty
horses away from the fort, but this
was not the attacking party. How-
ever, it was Crow custom to send
scouting parties ahead when they
planned a movement of any size, to
be sure they would not run foul of
the Blackfeet, their deadly enemies.
Therefore, when a second band of
Crows appeared, Culbertson knew the
squaw's story was about to be borne
out.
  The fort was provisioned. Rifles
were cleaned and balls were poured.
The fort had two bastions with a
three-pound cannon in each, and they
were put in readiness for service, and
supplied with powder and balls. A
guard was established. Water was
available, and the fort was equipped
to sustain an indefinite attack against
any number of Indians except for one
item—food. The fort depended pri-
marily on wild game for sustenance,
and in fact one man was hired as post
hunter for this purpose, but game was
scarce in the vicinity, and with the
horses gone, the amount of meat pro-
cured by foot-hunters was far less
than needed.
  In June the Crows appeared. They
made a camp about 400 yards away,
and a large contingent, well armed,
came to the gate and demanded ad-
mittance. Culbertson asked about the
horses, but got no satisfactory answer.
It was apparent that the Crows were
bent on war, and he ordered them
away, warning them that if they came
to the fort armed he would have his
men fire on them. He showed them
the Blood squaw who had escaped
and they were astonished, thinking
that she had died.
  So the siege began without a shot.
The Crows were alert and on the
prowl, so that the post was surround-
ed. But Culbertson kept a constant
guard, and the Crows were careful
not to come within range with their
weapons.
  The fort was almost on the river,
but the Crows were watchful; Cul-
bertson had a well dug within the
stockade so no one would have to go
outside, for he knew that Rotten Bel-
ly’s people were looking for an excuse
to start an assault in force. They
struck water ten feet down.
  Their fresh meat lasted two days;
dried meat lasted two days more.
Then the dogs were killed and eaten.
  Finally they boiled the parfleches—
containers of raw buffalo hide, which
cooked up in a mess that resembled
carpenter’s glue.
  Now Alexander Harvey, a promi-
nent company man, demanded permis-
sion to shoot the Indians. They could
not stay shut up in the stockade and
starve, he said.
ROTTEN BELLY'S SAD SIEGE
55
X/TAJOR CULBERTSON, though
only twenty-five years old, real-
ized the necessity of avoiding open
warfare with the powerful Orows.
The Crows did not trade at Fort Mc-
Kenzie, but if they took a notion
they could wreck the Blackfeet trade
—and that would put the post out of
business.
 The same Harvey found this out
ten years later at the same fort.
  But Culbertson’s hand was forced,
for Harvey planned with some of the
men to take the boat at night and
leave the fort. Culbertson therefore
notified Rotten Belly that if the
Crows did not leave by noon, he
would open hostilities and hurl
thunderbolts upon them. Rotten Belly
laughed.
 The three-pounder in the upper
bastion was charged with ball and
aimed at the Crow camp. At exactly
noon it crashed, and the heavy shot
went through the middle of the camp.
  Rotten Belly laughed no longer.
Nor did the Crows, who had insisted
on this expedition, linger. There was
shouting and turmoil. Lodges came
down; horses were mounted. Lodge
skins were thrown on the backs of
pack horses (the Crows did not use
the travois), and soon the entire vil-
lage was strung out along the river—
all going upstream away from the
fort.
  A few of them crossed the river
and fired some shots at the fort, but
without damage. The siege was over.
  The Crows said later that they had
never intended to hurt the garrison;
they had merely wanted to destroy
the fort which supplied their enemies
with rifles and ammunition. It was
an easy thing to say—as easy, per-
haps, as it had been for the white men
to say they would not supply such
arms to enemies of the Crows.
  Rotten Belly had been shamed. His
large party of warriors had been put
to rout by a single shot. Never mind
that it was a cannon. His shame was
great, and he now called on them to
follow him in Blackfeet country,
where they might take some scalps
and wipe out this disgrace.
  He got volunteers and they start-
ed out, but they did not fight Black-
feet. Near Fort Benton at a place
called Goose Bill they ran into twelve
warriors of the Gros Ventres. Rotten
Belly called on his Crows to attack.
  "We shall see who are brave men,”
he said. “I shall lead this attack, al-
though I do not think that I shall
live.”
  The Crows charged the Gros Ven-
tres and took exactly twelve scalps,
but the Gros Ventres were fighters
too, and Rotten Belly received a fatal
wound. “Tell my people,” he said be-
fore he died, “to keep peace with the
whites hereafter. There must be no
more war between them.’’
  The dying chief’s words were heard
and remembered, for the Crow nation
never again took up arms against the
white man.	• END
LAST CARD
  Grinnell emptied the magazine of
the rifle through the doors after them.
If he had judged Bayer right, the
rancher would stay belly-down in the
sawdust for some time to come.
  He was weary; it was an effort to
force his feet to move to the hitch-
rack where Bayer’s Kentucky horse
was dancing.
  The farmer still held his pistol,
puzzled. Grinnell turned to the wom-
an. “Get word to the U. S. Marshal at
Spokane Falls,” Grinnell said. "Tell
him Bayer had Shorty Morcross and
Slick Grinnell in here as lawdogs.”
But—why?” the wonian asked, and
(cont’d from page 52)
he knew she was talking about the
change.
  “I don’t know,” he answered. “I
don’t know exactly. .. Mighty pretty
place you got there, though, by the
lake.”
  He mounted the Kentucky horse
and pointed it toward the rim where
the tall grass grew. On the horizon
were the hills of Idaho, where he
could find a spring and rest awhile.
The horse could find its way back.
  The fever was high in his blood and
he started to grin. No matter if the
cards were marked, a man could up-
set the deal...	»END

IT LOOKED to Buck Sizemore,
riding up the main cowpath of
mustang, as if the town was get-
ting to be real civilized. There were
a few more shacks and dugouts, and
instead of only the two saloons—the
Wild Horse and the Black Wolf—
various business establishments now
spread all up and down the street.
  After this last long stretch on his
ranch in the lonesome reaches of No
Man’s Land, Buck was cheered to see
the note of progress. It did seem
queer, though, not to find a single
cowpony waiting at a hitchrack, nor
anyone along the main street.
  And Trady’s feed barn, where Buck
went to put up his pony, was deserted
too; no sign of even Limpy Horton
tilted back in his favorite chair. But
as Buck led the sorrel to a stall, he
discovered at last a sign of life: a
powdering of dust filtering down
 There were no courts in
 No Man's Land, no law
 except that of the sixgun.
 And yet Buck Sizemore
 wondered if civilization
 hadn't begun to reach
 this raw frontier.....
“How’s tricks?”
 “There ain’t no tricks,” answered
the barkeep gloomily, “and you better
find you a hole and crawl in it. Un-
shirted hell's liable to bust loose here
any minute.” He pushed bottle and
glass toward Buck and propped one
elbow on the bar.
 Thinking back to that sifting of
dust from the barn loft, Buck decided
to play innocent. “I just this minute
hove in,” he explained, searing his
gullet with a drink. “What’s going
on?”
 “You'll know soon enough,” hinted
Anse. Leaning near, he whispered,
“Thompson and two others mebbe
won’t see the sun come up tomorrow.
The vig’lance committee’s after ’em.”
"That being the case,” drawled
Buck, “I'll mosey on to Gus Wil-
lard’s and lay low.”
 Stepping outside, he saw Ed Mun-
from a crack in the loft floor. Almost
certainly this meant that someone was
hiding up there, but in Buck Size-
more’s code of etiquette, it wouldn’t
be polite to inquire who. So he got
feed and water for his pony, gave the
animal a parting slap on the flank,
and left without looking back.
  He was the one, lone customer at
the Wild Horse, and his spurs clat-
tered loudly in the empty room. It
wasn't healthy for a cowtown saloon
to be so quiet, that time of day. Even
Thompson, the gambler, wasn't at his
usual table, riffling a deck of greasy
cards.
 “Howdy, Anse,” hailed Buck.
ger walking down the middle of the
street, holding a Winchester and
looking both ways. Trailing him were
four men, all toting rifles and seem-
ing itchy to use them. Buck dodged
back inside.
 “Kinda crowded out there,” he
grinned. “Last time I saw Ed Mun-
ger, Thompson had got the drop on
him and made him dance, and there
was Ed with his hands up, kicking
sand fit to kill. He didn’t much like
the tinhorn after that.”
  •'Ed's been bound to get even,” said
Anse, “and this here claim-jumpin’
give him his chance to put it on
Thompson.”
56
TWO OR THREE FUNERALS
57
  As one of the posse turned in at
the swingdoor, Anse fell silent and
began busily polishing the bar.
  "Howdy,” greeted the guntoter.
Then, staring suspiciously at Buck,
“What you doin’ here?”
  “Just got in from the ranch,” an-
swered Buck, “and stopped here for
a slug of red-eye to warm me up.
Then I’m going on to Gus Willard’s.”
“If you go there,” growled the
man, “be sure to stay inside. You
hear?”
  Buck was no stranger to violence,
he had been in the thick of more than
one running fight with cattle rus-
tlers, yet he felt a chill prickling
down his spine as a few minutes
later, he walked along the street with
four men on his heels. Old Man Wil-
lard met him at the door of his little
shack.
  “Come right in,” he called, “and
rest your hat while I warm up tl>e
beans and cawfee. I been waitin’ ever
since I heard you’d hit town.”
  “First time in my life,” drawled
Buck, closing the door behind him,
“that I ever had an armed escort.
Those fellers must think a lot of me.”
“They seen you go to Tracy’s
barn,” said Gus, “and they been here
askin’ about you.”
  “I don’t see what for,” puzzled his
guest. “What’s back of all this ki-
hootin’, anyway?”
  “Plenty,” said old Gus cryptically.
“Come on, set up to the table and
I'll tell you later on.”
  At the crash of gunfire, Buck was
on his feet, reaching for his gun.
“I’m not going to set here like a
plumb coward while there's shootin’
going on.”
  “You step outside,” warned Gus,
“and you’re liable to run into a bul-
let. There'll be two °r three funerals
tomorrow, and that’s enough.”
  After another roaring fusillade,
silence and darkness closed in upon
the little town.
  Later, there was a knock at Gus
Willard's door. The old man started
up in his bunk. But Buck opened
the door, six-gun in hand.
  “Did you see Limpy Horton at the
barn?” asked one of the posse.
  “Not a sign of him when I went
there,” answered Buck.
  “Well,’’ growled his inquisitor, "we
knew he’s there and we’re goin’ to root
him out.” They made off, grumbling
among themselves.
  “What they got against poor Lim-
py?” asked Buck.
  “Nothing,” said the old man, “only
he worked for Tracy, and they figger
he might talk too much.”
THE TROUBLE had begun when
One-eye George came to Mustang
and bought a claim at the south edge
of town, paying a few hundred down
and the balance mebbeso-tomorrow.
Instead of living on his land to help
“prove up,” he got a job at the Black
Wolf Saloon and slept in the back
room.
  Three men—Bennet the storekeep-
er, Tracy who ran the feed barn, and
Thompson the gambler—put their
heads together and decided to run
One-eye off. So Thompson put up a
tent at one corner of the claim, and
when One-eye, warned of what was
going on, showed up and claimed
possession, he was driven off at gun-
point. Being mild-mannered and a
bad shot besides, the luckless fellow
stayed away.
  There were no courts in No Man's
Land, no law except that of self-de-
fense. You might say that the law
ended at a man’s front door. In Mus-
tang, a man couldn’t be arrested, no
matter what he’d done. There was
no jail to hold him, no judge to try
him, no jury to convict him. Only
horse and cattle thieves, when caught,
were punished—by the law of hemp,
a rope slung over a limb of the near-
est tree.
  Claim-jumping was generally con-
sidered a nuisance rather than a
serious crime, but the high-handed
tactics of the Thompson trio gave Ed
Munger his chance to finally square
things with the hated gambler who’d
made him dance to the song of bullets
cutting aroud his feet. And as Ben-
net and Tracy were in on the land
deal, they had to be dealt with also.
  About sundown, while Buck Size-
more was having supper at Old Man
Willard’s, the five man self-appointed
vigilance committee headed for
Thompson’s tent. They met their
man leaving a place where he’d had
supper. One of the posse fired, but
the shot fell short.
58
2-GUN WESTERN
  “Better raise your sights,” advised
their target coolly. The next bullet
came closer, and the gambler, for once
unarmed but defiant, 6neeringly told
them to try again. The third shot
struck him in the kneecap; he spun
around and fell, but managed to
crawl back to the one-room half-dug-
out, where the landlady was hiding in
terror.
  Instead of finishing off their vic-
tim then and there, the posse went
on to Bennet's store. The door was
locked, the building dark, but after
repeated pounding with gun butts,
the storekeeper came to the door,
holding a lighted lantern.
  “What’s up?” he asked shakily.
  “Thompson wants to see you,” said
Ed Munger. “He says you’re back of
the trouble over One-eye George.”
  “He’s mistaken,” said Bennet, “but
I’ll go see him anyway.” As he turned
to get his coat and hat, one of the
men ordered, “You come right now.”
 They tramped down the snowy
street, Bennet hatless and coatless,
his thumbs (by order) hooked in the
armholes of his vest.
  At the dugout, Thompson was ly-
ing on a cot, his knee swathed in
bandages. Half-conscious, he opened
his eyes and tried to speak. Then he
fell back, twenty-three bullets rid-
dling his body. Screeching in panic,
the landlady fled into the night.
  “It's your turn, Bennet,” said
Munger. "You deserve to die for
stealing One-eye’s claim.” A bullet
crashed through Bennet's brain. He
fell dead near the bloodsoaked bed
where Thompson lay.
  The posse then rode on to settle
with Tracy. But when they reached
his place, the feed-barn man had his
light buggy hitched up and he and
his wife were ready to drive off.
  “Halt or we’ll shoot,” the posse
shouted. Bullets whined through the
air, but Tracy laid the whip to his
team and left on a dead run. At the
first Kansas town they came to, he
begged for protection, and he and
his wife slept in the jail that night.
 Next morning, as Buck stood in
front of Old Man Willard’s, a wagon
came along, drawn by a yoke of
steers, a boy driving. Two armed
men walked on either side. Ed Mun-
ger following behind. Seeing two
long, narrow boxes in the wagon,
Buck called, “If you need help with
the grave-digging, I'll come along.”
“Come on,” jeered a guard, "and
we’ll bury you on top of the boxes.”
“Much obliged,” said Buck polite-
ly, "but I’ve changed my mind.”
 Ed Munger was hanging around
at the feed barn when Buck went to
get his pony. “Did you see Limpy
here yesterday?” he quizzed.
 “I told you before," answered
Buck, “I didn’t see a soul.”
  “Well, he was here all right,” said
Munger grimly, “hiding up in the
loft. We made him come out, then
we paid him off, give him a good
hoss, and told him he better go
where it was healthier. He lit out.”
Buck made no answer. He saddled
the sorrel and rode away, not even
stopping at the Wild Horse Saloon
for a parting drink. Mustang looked
more natural, with men going into
the saloons, and ponies waiting out-
side. But as Buck headed for the
snowy stretches of his ranch in No
Man's Land, he wondered if the
town had got such a big dose of civ-
ilization after all.	• END

TOM KELSEY had been so sure
of winning that his eager fin-
gers were already dragging in
the pot before Lew Hatton had a
chance to spread his own cards upon
the green-covered table. When he saw
the hand that beat his own, however,
the rancher stopped. He studied the
cards with worried blue eyes. And
then, slowly, he pushed the chips
back into the center of the table and
said, “Guess I was a little sud-

little, but the result was some-
thing that looked very sick.
  Lew Hatton didn’t smile.

   Kelsey was an easy mark for the gambler,

clipped mustache and closely-lidded
eyes never changed expression. He

owner was fidgeting a bit, uncertain-
ly, a frown on his homely, red-burnt
face as he eyed Hatton. He opened
his mouth hesitantly, said, “I’m—I’m
afraid I’ll have to ask you to let me
sign some more paper, Hatton. I put
a little more than I had into that
pot—” "
The gambler looked at him sharply.
Without a word he put down the
59
60	2-GUN
cards he was shuffling; without a
word, eased his lean frame out of the
chair, went over to a closed door and
threw it open.
  A swart, paunchy individual in
shirt sleeves and arm bands looked up
from behind a battered desk. This
was Spade Pierce, owner of the Red
Rooster. He eyed Hatton through the
smoke of a cigar that was stuck in his
slitted mouth.
  “Kelsey wants to make another
note, boss,” Hatton said. “You told me
to let you know.”
  A gleam as of anticipated pleasure
sprang into the narrow eyes of the
man at the desk. He took the cigar
out of his mouth and put it in an ash
tray, the chewed end dripping saliva.
His puffy hands rubbed together soft-
ly. “Send him in,” he directed. “Send
Mr. Kelsey right in!”
  Hatton nodded shortly, came out of
the office closing the door behind
him. Going back to the table he
glanced at the rancher with an eye-
brow raised, and indicated the door.
“You'll have to see Pierce,” he said.
  Kelsey looked like a dog that knows
it is going to be whipped. Slowly, he
got to his feet. He looked at the eyes
around him, and saw them all turned
away or merely staring at him with
helpless sympathy. With an effort,
the Rafter K owner straightened his
shoulders and walked into Spade
Pierce's office, bearing the air of a
doomed man.
  The game broke up all at once. The
other players mumbled excuses, and
got up pushing back their chairs with
a shuffling of feet. They didn’t look
at Hatton squarely; the gambler
shrugged, and cashed their chips for
them without comment.
  He knew, of course, what they were
thinking. No one ever lost any love
on a house dealer, and he had long ago
grown accustomed to that fact.
  He boxed the cards, put out the
hanging lamp above the table, and
walked over to the bar alone for a
drink. The Red Rooster was as good
a place as any to work, he thought as
he picked up the glass; but after he’d
been here a few months he’d probably
wander on to a job at another town
somewhere. Always taking with him
the agility of his lean, supple fin-
WESTERN
gers, and the luck that never failed
him as far as cards were concerned.
They were the instruments of his
trade.
  Leaning casually against the pol-
ished bar, he drank his whiskey slow-
ly, tasting it. One drink after every
session—that was all he allowed him-
self. Silent moments dragged by.
There was the drone of a fly, and the
sounds in the street outside where a
hot afternoon sun spilled its heat.
 Presently the door of Spade
Pierce’s office opened and Kelsey
came out again.
THE RANCHER stopped just with-
in the threshold, stood there star-
ing at the room. The handful of men
in the saloon didn’t look at him. After
a moment he came on shuffling feet to
to the cherrywood bar and ordered a
drink. His voice was hoarse; he
stared blankly at his own expression
in the bar mirror while the liquor was
poured, and threw the drink into his
mouth with a hand that trembled.
  After that he turned and faced Lew
Hatton. The rasp of his breathing was
audible in the room, as he tried with-
out success to check his anger. “All
right, you!” he gritted, blue eyes
blazing out of his homely, brick-red
face. “So it’s done! I know how you’ve
helped Spade Pierce to rob me, you
dirty, thieving—”
  Setting down his own glass, the
gambler straightened and looked at
him coldly. His eyes still hadn't
changed expression. But the voice
that cut through Kelsey’s words had a
sharp edge to it.
  “Hold on!” he snapped. “I don’t
take that kind of talk from anyone!”
  “You’ll take it from me—because
it’s true! My luck couldn’t have been
that bad. Not for two weeks straight!
I should have won part of the time—
and I would have, if you hadn’t
stripped the decks and played out of
your sleeve every damn chance
you—”
  “That’s a lie!” Hatton charged.
  Kelsey went light on, hotly, build-
ing into a weak rage. “You led me on!
You milked me clean for Pierce, day
after day—”
A TINHORN CHOOSES HOT LEAD
61
  “You led yourself on!” the gambler
amended. “I work here—it’s nothing
to me who I play with. I have to make
a game for anybody who wants one.
But you kept coming back, and every
time you got wilder. You beat your-
self!”
  The rancher’s face had paled a lit-
tle, and his mouth twisted harshly.
“Try to talk out of it—go ahead!
Why, you filthy tinhorn—”
  Hatton saw it coming a moment in
advance. Lashed by his own words,
Kelsey suddenly bit them off and was
falling back into a crouch. His right
hand shot downward, came up palm-
ing the rubber butt of a heavy sixgun.
  Lew Hatton couldn’t do anything
else in the face of that but defend
himself. Seconds after the other start-
ed his draw, his own hand was mov-
ing—up toward the breast of his coat,
sliding in easily toward his armpit.
Fingers closing around the hideout,
he drew the lean hand out easily,
gracefully. The two weapons coughed
their bullets forth almost at one time.
  But as burnt powder and silence
pressed in again on the tail of the
shots, Kelsey stumbled. He caught
himself with one hand gripping the
edge of the bar, hard. Astonishment
and pain washed across his homely
features. The gun slipped from his
fingers with a thud against the floor,
and he reached up to claw at his chest
as though he would try to dig out the
bullet that was killing him.
  Then he collapsed, dropping in a
lifeless heap at the foot of the bar.
 Looking down at him, Hatton
frowned. He hadn’t wanted this. He
had killed before; and always, it
seemed, in some futile manner. There
was no reason why Kelsey should
have died. But the rancher had forced
him to it.
  Hatton looked around at the men
in the silent room. He saw Spade
Pierce, who had come to the door of
his office at the shooting. As he
looked at the paunchy figure of the
saloon man, and the evil that lived in
his narrow eyes, the beginning of dis-
gust tugged at the gambler’s mouth...
  Then there was a great deal of con-
fusion. Town Marshal Ed Lane came
hurrying in—a small, spare gent in his
fifties, with thining hair and level
eyes that seemed to look right through
you. Lips pursed at sight of the dead
man on the floor, he set briskly to
work. He took a look at Hatton’s gun,
and shot out a rapid fire of questions
about the shooting; everyone who had
seen it told him that the gambler had
been forced into his part.
AFTER a bit, the coroner came in
and took the body away. And
presently, Hatton found himself alone
with the marshal in Lane’s cubbyhole
of an office, eyeing the back of the
little man as the latter stood gazing
silently out the door, pipe smoke curl-
ing above his thinning hair. Shadows
were long and sharp in the late sun-
light outside.
  “A bad business,” said the marshal
at last, with a sigh. “I’d close that Red
Rooster in two minutes if I could.”
He turned, cocked a challenging eye
upward at the gambler. “Yeah,” he
added, “you can tell Pierce I said so,
too!”
  His words irritated Hatton. “Don’t
look at me,” he retorted "I’m new to
this town, and I don’t figure to take
sides in its battles. I draw my pay,
and that’s all I care about.”
 Lane puffed a cloud of smoke,
shrugged. “Okay,” he said. “But Tom
Kelsey was a good man—hotheaded
and unreasonable at times, maybe, but
that's little enough against him. It’s
made me pretty sick to watch him go-
in’ back and goin’ back to that clip
joint, and losin’ his shirt every
time—”
  “The games I deal are square,” Hat-
ton told him, levelly.
 “Well, maybe so. But what of it?
That can’t make much difference now
to Kelsey—or his womanfolks.”
  Hatton looked at the other sharply.
“What women?” he demanded.
  “He had a wife and a girl—both as
fine a pair of ladies as I ever knew.
They had this little Rafter K spread
down on Somers’ Creek, and they was
a mighty happy family—until the Red
Rooster got its claws into Tom!”
  The marshal glanced into the street
again, suddenly pointed with his pipe
stem. “You can take a look for your-
self!*' he exclaimed. “Somebody’s
been and told them what’s happened,
and they’re cornin’ in now. Take a
62
2-GUN WESTERN
look and see what your cards and bul-
lets have done.”
  Reluctantly, Lew Hatton went to
the door and stood there watching as
a buckboard and team tooled into the
thick dust of Banville’s main street.
The younger woman held the reins;
her mother sat beside her, head bowed
in crushing grief. Looking at the dark
face of the gambler, Ed Lane thought
for a moment he saw a shadow there—
a hint of self-disgust, or regret for ir-
revocable wrong done.
  “I didn’t know,” Hatton said, slow-
ly. “I didn’t know about them—”
  The marshal only grunted, but he
put a lot of meaning into it.
  Riding beside the buckboard was
the man who had gone out to tell Kel-
sey's widow and daughter the news.
He happened to glance in the direc-
tion of the marshal's office now as
they rode abreast of it, and caught
sight of Hatton standing in the door.
At once he leaned and spoke to the
women in the buckboard, and both
lifted their heads and stared at the
gambler.
  There was loathing in their eyes.
And Hatton, his face like stone, met
their glances squarely, bearing the
brunt of their scorn. He was familiar
with the painted girls of saloon and
honkytonk; he was not prepared for
the loveliness he saw now, as the face
of Tom Kelsey's daughter was turned
to him. Somehow, it tightened his
throat for an instant.
  And then the buckboard had passed
on down the rutted street, leaving
Hatton staring after it from the door-
way. Behind him, the marshal asked
quietly, "Sort of proud of your pro-
fession right now, Hatton?”
  The gambler jerked around in sud-
den anger. "That killing wasn’t my
fault,” he retorted, hotly. “Kelsey
picked the fight, didn’t he?”
  Lane said nothing; only looked at
Hatton as he dragged another puff of
smoke out of his pipe. But the gam-
bler knew suddenly, as well as though
it had been put in words, what the
other was thinking.
HIS FACE darkened with resent-
ment. “All right, say it!” he grit-
ted. “Cards and liquor and gunplay—I
stand for those things, and it was
those things that ruined Tom Kelsey
and finally killed him. That’s what
you mean, isn't it?”
  The marshal calmly tamped out his
pipe. “You said it pretty well,” he
muttered. "An’ I reckon the Kelseys
see it the same way.” He stuffed the
briar in the pocket of his coat. “Well,
remember this, Hatton! Honest cards
or not—if I ever get the chance to
buck Spade Pierce and close out that
damn Red Rooster place of his, I’ll
close you out with it!”
  Hot with rage. Lew Hatton turned
his back and strode out of the mar-
shal's office. Lane had struck very
close, with those few terse words. The
pride of a gambler, and his anger at
being looked on as a pariah, were sud-
denly very high and strong in him.
 But what the lawman had said
troubled him, too, the more he let his
thoughts work on it. And there was
something else. Two women in a
buckboard, looking crushed and alone
as they drove through Banville's
dusty street. A face, young and
proud and sadly beautiful. ...
  He passed the saloon owner, Spade
Pierce, almost without seeing him.
But then, without knowing exactly
why he did it, he turned on his heel
and came back a step along the plank
sidewalk, stopping the fat man.
  “Just a second, Pierce,” he said. “I
want to talk to you.”
  The narrow eyes bored into his; the
cigar wheeled as the other said,
“Yeah?”
  “About the notes Kelsey signed for
you. Now that he’s dead, I suppose
you’re going to go easy on those,
aren’t you?”
  Pierce studied him coldly. “What’s
it to you?” he demanded.
  Hatton was asking the same ques-
tion of himself. He said, “Nothing, I
reckon. But I was just thinking of his
widow—”
  “And the gal, huh?” There was al-
most an evil sort of humor lurking far
back in the saloon man’s piggish eyes
as he said that. He took the soggy butt
of the cigar out of his mouth, spat on
the sidewalk. “Well,” he said, sur-
prisingly, “you can forget about the
notes. I’ve torn ’em up already.”
Hatton hadn’t expected that. He’d
thought it might take some persuad-
A TINHORN CHOOSES HOT LEAD
63
ing. Now he blinked a little, nodded.
“Good,” he said. “I'm glad you saw it
that way. .
  But he was not quite convinced, for
there was something in Pierce's man-
ner that didn’t set right.
  However, that seemed to close the
episode of Kelsey’s death. Hatton
went back to his work at the saloon,
and no one detected any change in
him. He was, perhaps, even more close
mouthed and unreadable than before,
but that in itself wasn’t strange.
  The front he gave to the world hid
much; and if he suddenly began to
find less pleasure in the whisper of
the cards, in the clink of chips on
baize-covered tables, he did not show
it. If, in the deep of the night, he sat
on the edge of his cot in the hotel,
smoking and staring at nothing, no
one knew. For he hardly understood
with any clearness, himself, just what
was happening to him.
  It was with strangely mingled feel-
ings of dread and anticipation that, on
the day of the funeral, Hatton found
himself in the group that went to
stand at the grave of the man he’d
killed.
  He knew he wasn’t wanted there.
He felt the weight of the hostile
glances that ranchers and their wives
threw at him as he stood apart from
the rest, gaunt and sombre in his dark
gambler’s clothes. Mouth hardening a
little, he ignored them. He knew, sud-
denly, that he was waiting for only
one thing, and when it came his heart
leaped and swelled within him until
he thought it would pound a hole in
his chest.
  One arm around her mother, the
girl came walking across the clipped
grass of the crude burial lot. Hatton
had learned her name—Mary. A very
ordinary name, but somehow filled
with the honest simplicity that was
the girl herself. She had real strength
in her. Hatton knew at once that his
first brief glance had not lied to him;
and looking at her, he told himself,
bitterly, that he was a fool.
THROUGH the brief services he
watched her quietly, drinking in
the sight of her. Then the pine box
coffin had been laid away, and the
first clods of earth dropped in upon
it. The little group dispersed. The
girl was among the last to leave, and
Hatton stood at a distance watching
her as she remained arranging the
flowers she had brought.
  Hat in hand, he walked over to her.
She glanced and saw him coming, and
at once he saw the stiffening of her
body. Coldly, she rose to face him;
and not far away, her mother had
turned and was staring at him, too.
  “Miss Kelsey,” he began, “I—just
wanted to tell you how sorry—”
  He faltered and stopped. There was
a bitterness and a wall between them
against which his poor words could
not prevail.
  The girl said only, “Very well.”
Hatton fumbled in his pocket and
brought out a battered wallet. He
looked down at the cracked, bulging
bulk of it, and then at Mary Kelsey.
“I would like to do something,” he
told her. “I was going to offer money
to you and your mother, but—I sup-
pose you wouldn’t take it—”
  “You are quite right we wouldn’t!"
she answered, shortly. “And if that
is all you have to say—”
  The same resentment Marshal Lane
had roused began to stir in him again.
“You’re not being fair, Miss Kelsey,”
he protested. “I didn't want to do—
what I did the other day. It was
forced on me. I couldn't stand there
and let your father plug me, could I?"
  “You should have!” The loathing
was in her gray eyes; her breast rose
and fell under the black of her mourn-
ing dress. The mother came a pace
or two nearer; uncertainly. “You
should have died, not him! The mon-
ey he lost to you was the thing that
put him in a mood for killing. You
goaded him on—and he was the one
to die!”
  Dark thunder swept uncontrollably
into Hatton’s face, at that. “I see!”
he exclaimed. “ ‘Plolier than thou.’ is
that it? Miss Kelsey, I'm not proud
of the work I do; but just because I
make my living out of cards instead
of breaking my back in the dirt, I’ll be
damned if I—”
  He caught himself suddenly, and
instantly his mounting temper cooled.
He had forgotten where he was; had
forgotten the silence of the burial lot,
and the newly covered grave at their
64
2-GUN WESTERN
feet. This girl, whose scorn-filled
eyes and biting words had lashed his
anger, was the daughter of the man
who had just been laid there for his
final rest. The man whom he had
killed.
  Contrition filled him. “Forgive
me!” he pleaded humbly. “I didn’t
mean—I'm sorry!”
  She tried to control her voice, but
emotion put a trembling in it. “Are
you finished?” she asked, tensely
quiet. “I think you’ve done quite
enough, Mr. Hatton. You’ve taken
away my father, and our home—”
  His head jerked up as he stared at
her. “Your home?” he echoed. “I don’t
understand!”
  “I suppose you didn’t know that
Spade Pierce made my father deed
over the Rafter K to him!”
  That staggered Hatton. “No!” he
exclaimed. “I swear it!”
  She said, “I think he made it con-
tingent upon payment of the money
my father owed him. But now—fa-
ther is dead! And Pierce has the deed,
and— I hope you’re pleased with eve-
rything you’ve done!”
  Suddenly she couldn’t bear to talk
to him any longer. She turned and
walked away, small shoulders back,
head proudly erect as she took her
mother’s arm. Hatton was left star-
ing after them.
HIS RESENTMENT at the girl
had been swept away by the news
she had just given him. Dragging on
his hat, he stood there thinking over
this new angle; and slowly his jaw
muscles began to harden into knots.
  So Pierce had lied! He remembered
how smoothly the saloon man had
told him about tearing up Kelsey’s
notes. Hatton was just the tool he’d
used to satisfy his greed!
  Inwardly seething, but with the old,
deadly calm showing in his face. Hat-
ton started down the hill toward the
sunbaked boxes that were the houses
of Banville.
  When he reached the saloon, he
strode on back and looked in Pierce’s
office. The fat man wasn’t behind his
desk. Hatton slammed the door and
went over to the bar. “Where’s
Pierce?”
  “I dunno,” the barkeep told him.
"He went out awhile ago. Took Stew
Bardon and one or two of the other
boys with him.”
  Hatton stopped outside the bat-
wings, looking up and down the sun-
smitten road as he built a cigarette
and lighted it. Then he went over to
the livery barn and rented a bronc.
  He was a good horseman, although
he seldom rode. Leaving the town be-
hind him, he struck out across lush
grazing land, browning now under the
hot summer sun, and sought the wood-
ed foothills where Pierce’s Wigwam
outfit was located. But he never got
as far as the ranch, for as he came out
on a spur he looked down over the
burning plain and saw three riders
jogging away from there.
  At this distance, through the heat
haze and dust of the valley floor, he
couldn’t see the trio clearly; but he
didn’t have to be told who they were.
Pierce, and his gunslinger Bardon,
and another. And they were heading
in the direction of the flashing bright-
ness which was Somers' Creek.
  Face grim, Hatton ticked his
mount’s ribs with spur steel and set
it on a course down through the hills.
The leisurely gait Pierce and the
others were taking indicated they
were very confident and sure of
themselves; it also gave Hatton time
to beat them to the goal if he hurried.
And that was what he did. Using the
spurs, he cut a circle around them and
then struck out in a rolling gallop. He
had left them far behind when Som-
ers’ Creek showed ahead, and the tiny
buildings that were the Rafter K.
  Hatton dropped from a saddle into
a cloud of dust, and waded through it
toward the front door of the little
house. It was a neat place, with a tiny
porch and curtains at the windows,
and vines climbing up the wbite wall.
The door opened as Hatton came up,
and Mary Kelsey faced him.
  She had a rifle in her hands, and be-
yond her Hatton caught a glimpse of
her mother, face white with grief, and
with fear at the sight of him. He
needed nothing more to tell him that
these women were alone here, and
that there would be no one to help
them when Pierce came.
  But the gun made him hesitate. The
A TINHORN CHOOSES HOT LEAD
65
girl said, “All right. You don’t need
to come any closer.”
  He shook his head. “You won’t lis-
ten to me,” he told her. “So I’ll not
try to talk. But take a look back there
along the trail.”
  She followed his pointing finger,
and caught her breath sharply at what
she saw. “Spade Pierce,” she ex-
claimed.
  “Yes. He’s coming to take over—or
try it!”
 Her eyes blazed, and her small
hands tightened on the rifle stock.
“Just let him!” she said, tightly.
  Hatton heard the gasp that the old
woman gave, at that. He said, rather
harshly, “Don’t be silly. You’re all
alone. One woman against the three
of them. And I think your mother
looks as though she were going to
faint.”
  The girl turned then to glance at
her, alarmed. She freed one hand to
put it on her mother’s shoulder. And
it was a simple matter for Hatton to
step to the door and pick the heavy
rifle out of her other hand.
MARY KELSEY tried to take it
back; but he took her arm gently
and forced her into the living room of
the little house. “Please,” he begged.
“Look after your mother. I know you
hate me; but let me try and handle
this for you.”
 Before she could answer he was
outside again, closing the door behind
him. The last glimpse he had of her
showed her gray eyes baffled and an-
gry, and yet with a new uncertainty
creeping into them as she stared after
him.
  Lew Hatton didn’t like a rifle, so
he leaned this one beside the door and
felt instead for the light revolver in
its clip holster under his arm. It was
there, and ready. So he went to the
front of the little porch and leaned
casually against a post with the vines
dripping about his head, and waited
for Pierce.
  The fat man was in the center, on
a jug headed roan, with squint-eyed
Stew Bardon at his right and another
gunslinger on the other side. They
drew rein before the house and stayed
in the saddle, while they eyed the
lone man who guarded the door.
  Spade Pierce looked suspicious and
puzzled. “Morning, Hatton,” he said,
cautiously. “I didn't figure to find
you here.”
 “Don’t reckon you did.” Hatton
still stood at ease, one shoulder
against the post. His face was blank,
unreadable.
  “Social call?” the saloon man asked,
feeling him out.
 The gambler’s reply was a slow
shake of the head. He didn’t once take
his glance from the eyes of the other,
and Pierce began to grow nervous.
  “Well,” the saloon man said, “we’re
here on business ourselves. If you’ll
excuse us, we want to talk to the
ladies—”
  “I'm settling this affair for them,”
Hatton answered. He straightened,
and was suddenly wary, intent. His
voice cracked out: "Take that phony
deed and turn around and get the hell
out of here, Spade! That goes for
your hired killers, too!”
  Pierce tauted. “Oh, you know about
it, eh?” he snarled. "Well, this
deed—”
  “—Was bought with gambling debts
—which aren’t and never have been
legal!” Hatton finished. “I’m not let-
ting you collect on it: and I reckon
you know Marshal Lane wouldn’t
have anything to do with it, either!”
  He thought Spade Pierce was going
to explode, then. He saw the two gun-
men watching their boss, waiting for
instructions.
 “Damn you, Hatton!” the saloon
man shouted. “Keep your nose out of
other people’s business! Get out of
that doorway and—”
  “I don't know but what I ought to
kill you, Pierce,” said Hatton, quiet-
ly. “I killed Tom Kelsey, and he
didn’t deserve it any more than you
do. He wouldn’t have crowded a
man’s widow and daughter this way,
on the very day of the funeral. He
wouldn’t have been such a damn
skunk!”
 With a screech of rage, Spade
Pierce suddenly dug for a gun. He
was fast—faster than Hatton could
have dreamed. The gambler’s weapon
was barely out of its clip holster when
the first bullet crashed into him.
That bullet was meant for his heart;
instead, it hit the gunarm that was
66
2-GUN WESTERN
doubled across his chest, and broke
it. The hideout gun dropped from
Hatton’s numbed fingers and struck
the floor of the porch. And the gam-
bler, in the fierce grip of pain,
dropped after it.
  He heard Pierce’s shout of tri-
umph, as from a great distance, and
knew the saloon man thought that
slug had killed him. Fire raged
through his shattered arm, gnawed
into his brain.
HATTON forced himself up,
looked and saw the gun he’d
dropped lying inches away. He
groped for it with his left hand. Stew
Bardon yelled at his boss as he saw
that the man was still alive.
  Next moment a snarling hell of lead
rained down on the neat painted floor
of the porch. Hatton hoped vaguely
none of those flying slugs would go
through the door, into the house
where the girl and her mother were.
He got the gun into his fingers as
the hot hand of lead touched him in a
couple of places.
  Then he was answering the fire of
the three killers, left-handed. Stew
Bardon screamed and dropped from
saddle.
  Spade Pierce and the other man
were fighting their lunging horses,
that had been frightened to a panic
by the racket of the gunfire; Hatton
knew that only that fact had saved
him from their bullets. Carefully, he
propped his elbow against the floor
beneath him and drew a line on the
saloon man’s bulky frame.
  Acrid smoke bit into his eyes with
the tug of the trigger.
SON OF A GUN
  I-Ie barely heard the report. A gray
fog was coming down on him.
Through it he saw, dimly, two horses
galloping away, dwindling against the
horizon. There was a man on the back
of one, crouched low over the neck
of the pony as though mortally afraid
of bullets from the rear. But the sad-
dle of Spade Pierce’s jug headed roan
was empty.
  A bulky figure lay still in the dirt,
in front of the house.
  Fog settled in again. It was cool—
cool and soft, like a hand. But maybe
it really was a hand he felt.
  He heard himself saying: "The
deed—get it from' his pocket. Tear it
up. It’s worthless.....”
  Another voice was sobbing. Some-
thing like, “Don’t die! Please don’t
die!”
  “You’re being silly, Mary!” That,
he thought, must be Tom Kelsey’s
widow speaking. “He won’t die,” she
said. “He’s only shot up a little.”
  And Hatton told himself that she
had to be right! For Mary Kelsey and
her mother would need help on the
Rafter K, now that Tom was gone.
  He knew for sure only that, if he
lived, cards and gambling would be a
thing of the past with him. It war.
better to sweat and toil in the clean
earth, and be free of men like Spade
Pierce, and the Red Rooster with its
smoke and stench.
  He knew, too, that the loathing
would be missing from the girl’s gray
eyes, after this. To Hatton, lying half
in the shadow of oblivion, it was not
necessary to ask for more....

ONE OF THE favorite dishes of the old-time western cowboy was a stew
called all sorts of names but the mildest of them all was “son of a gun”.
Everything went into it except the hide, horns and hoofs of the animal in
question. This always, incidentally, came from “the other feller’s herd,” as
no cowman liked the taste of his own beef.
  To rustle it up, you cooked the toughest ingredients first—such as the
heart, which was cut into tiny cubes; and the tongue, which was skinned
before it was cubed. Then pieces of tenderloin, and sweetbreads and liver.
These last were used sparingly to avoid bitterness.
  Next, you had an argument, if there were other cooks around, as to
whether or not the marrow gut should be added. For even though this is
only the tube connecting the two stomachs of cut-chewing creatures, opin-
ions on its value to the stew were always varied and sometimes violent. If

Park that day. He was sprawled flat
on the ground then, with a rifle
shoved out before him and a man's
white face notched neatly in the
center of his sights; his finger was
tightening on the trigger when big,
rawboned easy-going Rod Donnelly,
who'd been packing a gun of one sort
or another ever since he’d been a kid,
found out that he didn’t have what it
took to kill a man.
  Not that there was any lack of prov-
ocation. Just a few minutes before
Donnelly and bearded little Alec
Brendle, who rode humped over in his
Bullefs whined abou) him as he reached the cabin.

His finger was tightening on the trigger when Rod

a kid, found out that he didn’t have what it took to
kill a man....

2-GUN WESTERN
saddle like a jockey, had swung their
mounts across a flat filled with new
snow. They had covered forty miles
since daybreak, the better part of it in
silence. Alec Brendle was a Scotsman,
frugal even with his words, and Don-
nelly had picked up something of the
old man's habit; but as they turned
their horses up slope toward the trees
Donnelly put his head back and saw
their cabin just ahead. Beyond the
cabin, still hidden by the trees, was
the prospect shaft they had gouged
out of the rocky slope—the mine that
was to make them rich.
  “She’s still there, Alec,'' the young-
er man said cheerfully.
  “Aye,” said Alec Brendle.
  It was the last word he ever spoke.
The bullet hit the little Scotsman in
the chest; it knocked him backward
and out of saddle as his frightened
horse plunged aside. Donnelly heard
the blasting roar of the shot, the twin
echoes of the two shots following; he
felt the tug of the bullet that touched
a sleeve of his bearskin coat. His horse
was rearing frantically when hidden
rifles on the hillside slope crashed in
a second shattering volley.
  The shelter of the trees, and safety,
was no more than twenty feet away,
but there was little Alec Brendle on
the ground. Deftly the big puncher
slipped his carbine from the saddle
boot. Unhesitatingly he quit the
plunging horse to kneel beside the
fallen man. With bullets whining
overhead he turned Alec Brendle on
his back; he looked at Brendle’s face
and saw that the little Scotsman was
beyond the need of help. Lead burned
a path of fire across his ribs. As he
threw himself toward the trees a bul-
let cut his feet out under him and sent
him pitching forward in a headlong
dive.
  He landed on hands and knees, and
still clutching the short rifle grimly,
he crawled toward a snow-covered
piny.on log. Back braced against the
log, safe for the moment, Donnelly
checked up on the damage done. One
bullet had grazed his ribs quite harm-
lessly; a second had struck him in the
leg, just above the ankle. It was this
second wound which made Donnelly
frown. Already his boot was filling
up with blood.
  He lifted his head for a hasty glance
over that snow-covered slope, but saw
no sign of the killers he knew were
concealed somewhere above in rocks
and trees. Calmly,, dispassionately, he
considered the situation. Old Alec
Brendle dead, killed by a cowardly
bullet out of ambush. An unknown
number of killers between himself and
the cabin. In an empty, desolate land,
winter-locked, with the nearest ranch-
house almost twenty miles away, he
was afoot and wounded and out-
numbered by a murder pack. What
motive might lie behind the treach-
erous attack he did not know. It would
be something about the mine, he
thought. If he pulled out alive there
would be time to consider motive
later.
  Flat on his side behind the log he
removed the blood-filled boot. Awk-
wardly, but efficiently, he bandaged
the ankle tightly with strips of cloth
torn from his undershirt; that done,
he set out to locate the men above him.
Having lost his hat in his hasty dive
for shelter he was forced to use his
coat as a decoy. It was a good coat, a
bearskin coat cut hip length for a man
who spent time in the saddle. Don-
nelly had killed the bear; he had
tanned the hide himself, and had the
garment tailored to his own particular
specifications.
  Draping the bearskin coat over the
barrel of his rifle, carefully the
wounded man hoisted it above the
level of the log. On the hillside a rifle
crack. Donnelly lowered the decoy.
  “One," he said.
 He worked patiently, crawling
through the snow, sliding the fur coat
along the snow-covered log. By the
time he reached the end of the log
he had drawn half a dozen shots, and
had a fair picture of the problem
ahead of him. Three men on that hill-
side slope, he guessed; two hidden
behind rocks close together, the third
in trees and brush some fifty feet
farther up the slope. Already this
third man was working around the
hillside to cut behind him.
  There was no pain in the wounded
leg yet, but the blood in his boot was
uncomfortable and he was dragging a
crimson trail behind him through the
snow. The situation seemed to call
THROUGH GUNSIGHTS
69
for a flanking maneuver, and with
this in mind he turned his back on
those men above him. Like a wounded
animal slipping away from the hunt-
er's gun he crawled through tunnels
between snow-laden clumps of brush,
using each bit of cover, each slight
depression on the hillside slope to aid
him on his way. He got away without
a shot being fired; two hundred
yards and he was deep in brush and
trees, and he pulled himself erect then
and tried his weight on the bullet-
torn leg. And gasped at the sudden
stabbing pain that ran through his
body, knowing then that the bullet
had shattered a bone. Donnelly’s lips
tightened in a twisted grin.
  “Nice,” he muttered. “Very nice,
indeed.”
WITH NO knowledge of when the
first of that killer pack might
break through the trees, calmly he
took time out to make a pair of
crutches. They were nothing fancy;
they were two cedar branches hacked
off with a pocketknife, with limb
crotches to serve as arm rests, but
Donnelly tried them in a few hobbling
steps and found they would suffice.
He went on awkwardly, slipping and
sliding on the frozen slope, stumbling,
falling, climbing to his feet again, but
always working deeper into the trees
as he pushed steadily up the slope.
  How long it took to reach the top
of the ridge Rod Donnelly didn’t
know. On crutches it was a heart-
breaking chore; but reach the top he
did; and once across the ridge abrupt-
ly he changed directions, pointing up
canyon in a course which would lead
him to the cabin. For the moment he
had slipped away from his attackers.
How long his luck would hold he
didn’t know. In this game of life and
death he was terribly handicapped,
but he had also one slight advantage;
he knew each foot of this lonely
country as a man might know his own
back yard.
  Two hundred yards up canyon he
cut back toward the top of the ridge.
Discarding the crutches temporarily
he crawled through snow on hands
and knees, shoving the rifle before
him. Atop the ridge he lay flat, sweep-
ing the wintry waste below in slow
and careful inspection.
  He located one man first, and then
another. They were far below, mere
blurs of color against a white back-
ground, moving cautiously from tree
to tree as they sought to locate the
man who had slipped away from them.
If there was a third one in the party
Rod Donnelly could not find him, al-
though he gave ten minutes to the ef-
fort.
 “He’s gone ahead,” he decided.
"He’s worked around the point.”
  Having placed the missing member
of the murder pack to his own satis-
faction Donnelly faced another prob-
lem. Both men below were within
rifle range but as a shot would be a
gamble, and with his crippled leg the
cowpuncher didn’t feel like trying to
slip closer to the pair. And a shot now
would reveal his position, undo all the
advantage gained by the heart-break-
ing effort on the crutches. He was not
very far from the cabin. .. .
 The sound of a snapping stick
jerked Donnelly around, froze him
into sudden rigidity there on the
frozen ground. Off to his left and
below him a man had come suddenly
into view from behind a snow-
blanketed clump of brush, a man who
must have been resting there through
all the time that Donnelly had
tried to locate him. In corduroys and
heavy sheepskin coat, with a rifle
swinging in his hand, he was pushing
his way slowly up the slope. He was
so close that Donnelly could hear the
crusted snow crunching beneath his
boots.
  And Donnelly’s lips moved sound-
lessly. “Galt!” he said. “Dave Galt!”
  Dave Galt he knew quite well. Galt
owned a little one-cow spread beyond
the mountain. Also, he owned a pack
of hunting dogs, and in spare time
Galt had built a rep hunting mountain
lions. More than once, on the trail of
a big cat, he had stayed overnight at
the cabin with Donnelly and little
Alec Brendle. That now Galt should
reveal himself as one of the men who
had ambushed little Alec and himself
was for an instant unbelievable to big
Rod Donnelly; and then, suddenly, it
was not surprising at aU. He could re-
member nights when that dark and
sullen man had sat around the cabin,
asking questions about the mine the
70
2-GUN WESTERN
while his beady eyes moved restlessly
missing nothing.
  Dave Galt had reached the top of
the ridge. He went down on hands
and knees; he crawled forward push-
ing the rifle ahead of him, scanning
the snow-filled canyon below with
alert and wary eyes. Quite evidently
he had guessed that Donnelly might
double back up-trail. He wasn’t fifty
yards from Donnelly, but Donnelly
was beyond him on the ridge and
Galt’s attention was directed the oth-
er way.
  And slowly, carefully, Donnelly
worked the thirty-thirty carbine
around and laid the barrel across a
snow-crusted rock. He knew this man
he dealt with; even before today’s
events; he'd known that Dave Galt
was a dangerous man. Galt was
sprawled flat now. head and shoulders
up, his body hidden by brush. Don-
nelly could see his tight fitting fur
cap, the collar of the sheepskin coat.
He drew a careful bead, his finger
closing down on the trigger. He hesi-
tated.
  And then, as though warned by
some subtle sixth sense, Dave Galt
turned his head slowly and looked
straight into Donnelly’s eyes.
  It was a queer thing. There was
this moment when these two men
looked at one another across fifty
yards of space— Dave Galt, caught
off guard, helpless, looking down a
bright and shining barrel into the
eyes of a man he’d planned to kill—
Rod Donnelly, squinting through
gun-sights at one of the murder pack
who had done for Alec Brendle, his
finger tightening on the trigger for
the shot that would send a bullet
crashing through Dave Galt's head.
AND NOTHING happened. It was
queer, even to Donnelly. He
couldn’t pull the trigger. He
couldn’t add that ultimate ounce of
pressure which would smash a thirty-
thirty bullet between Galt's staring
eyes. It wasn’t sympathy, compassion,
doubt; in Donnelly’s mind was no
question but that Galt was the man
responsible for Alec Brendle’s death.
It was something fundamental; some-
thing buried deep in Donnelly him-
self. He wasn't a killer, it seemed. He
couldn’t kill a man.
  And the big puncher’s finger was
still tugging at the trigger, and he
was still staring at Galt through rifle
sights, when suddenly the other man
broke the spell. Dave Galt spun like a
big cat in the snow to fling himself
behind a pile of snow-covered rocks.
Hardly had he disappeared when his
rifle crashed, one shot and another
and another, the bullets kicking up
puffs of snow around Rod Donnelly’s
head.
  Donnelly had ducked back auto-
matically. He lay sprawled in the
snow, thinking of that priceless
chance he had let slip through his
fingers—the chance to pay off one of
Alec Brendle’s killers with hot lead.
He said disgustedly: “I'm damned!
Buck fever!”
  Pain from the bullet-shattered leg
throbbed through his body. Face
down in snow, he cursed the chicken-
hearted softness which had caused
him to spare Galt’s life, knowing quite
well that he might pay dearly for that
instant of weakness before this game
was over. Granted a similar chance
there would be no hesitation on the
part of Galt, or of that pair who
travelled with him. Old Alec, dead on
a snow-filled flat below, offered mute
testimony on that point.
  It was too late for regrets. Galt had
ducked from sight. Galt was on one
side of the ridge now, Donnelly on the
other. The puncher twisted in the
snow, gun held on the spot where Galt
had disappeared. He gained a glimpse
of Galt’s fur cap above a rock; he trig-
gered a hasty shot and the cap pulled
out of sight. He knew that Galt had
held it up to draw his fire. A second
later Galt fired twice, the slugs whin-
ing harmlessly overhead.
  Then it was that Donnelly got an-
other shock. He had known that his
leg was bleeding, but he was not pre-
pared for the widening crimson circle
in the snow where his foot had rested.
That much blood meant that the bullet
must have severed an artery in his leg.
Already he had lost more blood than
he could conveniently spare.
  He threw a shot down slope in
Galt's direction, not bothering to aim.
Then, swiftly, he went to work on the
ankle. With his bandanna handker-
chief he rigged a tourniquet above
THROUGH GUNSiGHTS

the blood-soaked bandage, twisting it
tight and tighter with a stick, setting
his jaw against the pain that rolled
over him as he lashed the stick itself
against his leg. It was done at last,
and then, slowly, cautiously, crawling
from bush to rock, from rock to snow-
covered bush, he worked his way back
along the ridge away from Galt and
toward the cabin.
  Knowing each foot of this country
he knew exactly the point at which,
having left Galt behind on the thick-
ly-wooded hillside, he had to cross the
ridge to drop down on the cabin from
the rear. He persevered grimly, push-
ing his rifle ahead and dragging his
useless leg behind, dropping down
slope with agonizing slowness toward
the cabin. The crutches he had aban-
doned.
  There was a small space of level
ground at the bottom of the slope. He
managed it on hands and knees, ex-
pecting each instant to hear the blast-
ing roar of guns from the hillside.
Nothing happened; he pulled up in
the shadow of the cabin wall without
event. The cabin had one door, in
front; there was a window at the
back, on hinges and fortunately un-
locked. He shoved the window open,
hoisted his body over the sill, crawled
inside the cabin.
  Inside, he managed to get his one
good leg under him and pulled himself
erect. He hopped through to the
kitchen. There was a fire in the range,
and on the oilcloth-covered table were
dirty dishes which had not been there
when he and Alec had left the cabin
two days before. Outside the kitchen
window he could see a path already
well-broken through the new snow
leading to the tar-paper shack which
had served Alec and himself as com-
bination stable and blacksmith shop.
That Galt and his men had spent time
here was evident, but now Donnelly
could see no sign of any of them about
the place.
ON A CORNER of the kitchen
table Donnelly assembled a miscel-
lany of instruments and material: a
Colt sixgun, a pocket-knife, a quart
bottle of whiskey, a package of absorb-
ent cotton, and strips of white cloth
for bandages. Aware that he might be
interrupted any moment he lost no
time. Already the tourniquet on his
leg was biting into flesh; he set his
jaw and hooked it up another notch.
He cut the blood-soaked bandage
from his ankle and soaked the leg
liberally with whiskey. The bullet
had gone through neatly, in and out.
In the wound he rammed plugs of
absorbent cotton soaked in whiskey,
closing his teeth against the pain and
pushing the plugs solidly into place
with a match stick. He sloshed more
whiskey on the leg, wrapped it
tightly with layer after layer of ban-
dage. That done, he removed the tour-
niquet and wrapped leg and foot in
wide strips torn from a blanket. It was
makeshift medicine, the best he could
manage under the circumstances.
  He was finished barely in time. He
had just finished tying the blanket-
bandage in place when he lifted his
head to see men and horses coming up
the trail toward the cabin. Three men,
with two saddled horses; and then
Donnelly saw that Galt and his crew
had caught up old Alec’s horse and
his own. Their thought was plain
enough; in this lonely wasteland a
wounded man on foot would be in des-
perate plight.
  The three men came on carelesslv,
Dave Galt in front, and behind Galt
two men leading the captured horses.
Donnelly recognized them both; the
tall one was Pete Duchelle, the short-
er one Clint Abad; both worked for
Dave Galt's K Bar outfit beyond the
mountain. Knowing them onlv slight-
ly, Donnelly knew them well enough
to know that both were tough hands.
  He reached for his rifle, resting
against the table. By the time he got
the gun the men with the horses had
turned aside toward the stable and
Galt was coming up the trail alone. He
came on, striding carelessly, a big,
hook-nosed man in levis and sheen-
skin coat. Sixgun in hand Rod Don-
nelly worked his way along the wall
to stand quietly just inside the cabin
door.
 The door shoved open. Galt was
coming through the doorway when
Donnelly stabbed him with the Colt.
  "Lift ’em, Galt!” he snapped.
  For the space of a single heartbeat
big, hook-nosed Dave Galt stared at
2-GUN WESTERN
him in stunned surprise. Then he
moved like a striking snake. One hand
pawed out in a lightning thrust to
knock the gun aside. Galt’s body
twisted, and his big shoulders pinned
Donnelly back against the wall. One
hand found Donnelly's throat. With
the other Galt was grabbing for the
sixgun when Rod Donnelly shoved
clear of the wall and smashed the bar-
rell of the gun against Galt's head.
  That single stunning blow checked
the fury of Galt’s attack, drove the
hook-nosed man back on his heels.
With only one good leg under him
Donnelly grabbed Galt around the
neck: he held with one hand while he
brought the sixgun crashing down on
Galt's head in a terrific blow that sent
Galt toppling backward through the
open cabin door. Donnelly sprawled
on top of him.
  Dave Galt was spread-eagled in the
snow, unconscious. Donnelly pushed
to his knees, and a gun roared, and the
big puncher looked up to see Pete
Duchelle, rifle in his hand, taking
careful aim for a second shot from the
door of the blacksmith shop. He threw
himself aside as the gun exploded,
and he heard the bullet thud into log
walls at his back. With his sixgun he
threw two shots at Duchelle and drove
the man back inside the blacksmith
shop. Grabbing Dave Galt by the col-
lar he dragged the hook-nosed man
inside the cabin.
  There, watching meanwhile through
the window, he bound Galt hand and
foot.
  Dave Galt rolled over. For an in-
stant the beady black eyes he fixed on
Donnelly were filled with puzzle-
ment. Donnelly was sprawled on the
floor by the window, watching the
blacksmith shop.
 “For a wounded gent you get
around fast,” the hook-nosed man
growled suddenly.
  He wriggled into a more comfort-
able position. “I could use a smoke.’’
“You could?” said Donnelly. He
rolled a cigarette, lit it, drank in a
lungful of smoke. “I could use some
information, Galt. What in hell was
your idea, killing Alec?”
  Galt regarded him unblinkingly.
“Figured the mine was worth it.”
Donnelly stared at him. “The mine’s
recorded. You couldn t jump it—you
couldn't get away with it if you killed
both of us—”
  "Figgered to kill both of you,”
stated Galt brazenly. “Mebbe, though,
I wasn't figgering to jump the mine.”
“What was it, then?”
  Galt’s thin lips curled mockingly.
“Roll me a smoke and I’ll tell you.”
BEYOND the cabin, from the direc-
tion of the blacksmith shop, a gun
roared once, and window glass shat-
tered on the floor and the slug crashed
into pans behind the stove. Donnelly
glanced out casually. He rolled a cig-
arette and leaned over to shove it be-
tween the lips of the bound man on
the floor. He held a match while Galt
puffed contentedly.
  “Tell me,” he said.
  “It was a tip I got," said Galt. “A
gent in town tipped me off you two
jaspers had banked more’n five thou-
sand dollars in the last three months.
Way I figgered it, that meant you and
old Alec had hit a pocket of high
grade—it couldn't mean anything else.
I knew once the Pass snowed in
there’d be nobody here until spring.
Mebbe not then. Three men can do a
hell of a lot of digging between now
and next spring.”
  “You figured to clean the pocket
out? Be gone in the spring, before we
were missed—before the killings were
discovered—”
  Dave Galt grinned harshly. “Some-
thing like that. Course, after it was
found you two had disappeared, after
the excitiment died down, a gent
could move in and take the mine with-
out too much trouble.”
  And Donnelly nodded grim under-
standing. His first thought had been
that the killing of Alec Brendle had
been brutally purposeless; he saw now
that the crime, his own murder as
well, had been planned by a cold and
ruthless brain. Dave Galt had guessed
correctly when he guessed that the
two partners had hit upon high-grade
ore. And. during the long winter
months, the three killers could quite
easily have cleaned out that pocket.
They could have been gone with the
spring thaws, leaving behind no rec-
ord of their crime. If, later, they
cared to come back and file claim to
THROUGH GUNSIGHTS

the mine, there would be none to dis-
pute their ownership.
  “You hit it right, Galt,” Rod Don-
nelly said slowly. “We found a pock-
et, Alec and me. Quartz you can crum-
ble in your fingers, rotten with gold.
It's up there now—and you’ll never
get it. Some of it will buy drinks for
San Lorenzo the day you hang.”
  Dave Galt expelled a thin stream of
blue smoke. “Mebbe,” he said hardily.
“I ain’t on the gallows yet. It’s forty
miles to San Lorenzo, and you got
two jaspers to wrap up and tag before
you make delivery.”
  “Those gents will pull out, Galt.”
  Galt grinned at him. “With Alec
Brendle dead down on the flat?” he
jeered. “With them knowing they got
a murder charge to face if you get out
of here alive? Don’t fool yourself,
Donnelly. Those gents will camp right
here till your hide’s nailed on the
wall.”
  And, deep in his heart. Rod Donnel-
ly had no choise but to agree with that
hooked-nose killer on the floor. The
odds were two to one against him.
More, the scales were tipped in anoth-
er way: he was crippled: he had lost
more blood than he could afford; and
he knew in a few hours more or less
that fever would be rushing through
his veins. He knew that then he would
be in no shape to deal with those kil-
lers beyond the cabin.
  “They got the horses,” Galt said.
“Don’t reckon you'll try to hop to
town on one foot. And you got to
sleep sometime. This is a finish fight,
Donnelly, and you’re still a hell of a
long ways from San Lorenzo.”
  A finish fight! A fight he didn’t
have much chance of winning. Don-
nelly could see that now, very clearly.
Stretched out beside the window, his
wounded leg on fire, he watched
against the chance of a surprise at-
tack by that pair camped in the
blacksmith shop. But probably they
wouldn’t attack; probably they would
be content to wait. They could af-
ford to wait. In this empty, snow-
filled wasteland there was no need
for haste.
  “You had your chance to kill me
once today,” said Galt suddenly. “You
had me dead center in rifle sights.
Why didn’t you squeeze trigger?”
  “Maybe I was saving you for the
gallows, Galt?”
  “Hell!” said the hook-nosed man
scornfully. “You didn’t have the guts
to shoot! I’ve known gents like that
before now—gents packing a gun they
were afraid to use. It takes nerve to
kill a man, Donnelly—even a man you
hate. Mebbe you didn't know that be-
fore today.”
Donnelly looked up. “You got
that kind of nerve, Galt."
  “Sure,” said Galt. “It was my slug
killed Alec Brendle. Why should I
lie now? You had your chance to
square it and you couldn’t pull the
trigger.” He grinned wickedly. "Meb-
be it was Bible stuff. Thou shalt not
kill, eh, Donnelly? Mebbe that's why
you held your fire?”
  "Maybe,” said Donnelly. He crawled
across the kitchen to stoke the
range with clumps of p i n y o n
wood. He piled the firebox full, then
crawled on to close the door between
kitchen and bedroom, and came
back to take his position at the win-
dow. Pain moved along his leg in
knife-thrusts of agony. There was
still no sign of activity from the
blacksmith shop. Those men could
wait. He couldn’t. He had to bring
this to a boil—had to end it quickly,
one way or another.
  Heat from the blazing stove spread
out and filled the tiny rom. Dave
Galt wriggled in his sheepskin coat,
perspiration flowing down his lean
face.
  “You trying to roast us Donnelly?”
he snarled.
  “Take off the coat,” said Rod.
  "With my hands tied behind me?”
  Donnelly moved around him. “I’ll
untie you long enough to slide out of
the coat,” he said. “Don't try any-
thing, Galt. Maybe I ain’t got nerve
enough to kill a man, but sure as hell
I’ll knock your skull loose from your
shoulders if you make one funny
move!’’
  He untied Galt's wrists, waited
while the hook-nosed man wriggled
out of the sheepskin coat, tied the
wrists again. His gun was in Galt's
back, but the other submitted without
protest. From the blacksmith shop a
rifle roared and a bullet buried itself
in log walls.
74
2-GUN WESTERN
 Time crawled. Rod Donnelly
sprawled by his window, thinking
back. Remembering how his partner-
ship with Alec Brendle had begun.
  Suddenly, he rolled over, shoved
the cabin door wide open. A lead slug
sliced slivera from the door jamb. He
looked at hook-nosed Galt. “We’ll
be going now,” he said.
  “Going!” echoed Galt. He stared
at Donnelly. "You aiming to crow-
hop to town Donnelly?”
  “I got a better way,” said Donnelly
curtly. He reached for a strip of the
torn blanket on the floor. “I’ll have to
blindfold you.”
  “Blindfold me?” said Galt. For the
first time a trace of uneasines was
in the tone of the hooked-nosed man.
“What you figgering to do?”
  Donnelly’s face was a bleak mask.
“It will be revealed,” he said, “Hold
still or I’ll cave your head in.”
  Tightly he fixed the blindfold
around the bound man’s eyes. And
suddenly all of Dave Galt’s harsh as-
surance was gone. There was the be-
ginning of panic in Galt’s voice.
  “You aiming to use me for a shield,
Donnelly?”
  Donnelly cut the ropes binding his
legs. “Stand up,” he said. "It’s cold
out—you'll want a coat.”
“What you planning, Donnelly?”
“Listen, Galt. I’m going to untie
your hands now. Just long enough for
you to crawl into your coat. I’ll have
a gun in your back all the time.”
  He prodded Galt with the six-gun
to let him know that it was there.
Then, body braced against the wall,
he held the coat while the blindfolded
man slid his arms reluctantly through
the sleeves. He slapped a Stetson on
Galt’s head. "Your hat's outside.
You’ll have to wear one of mine.”
Galt spoke earnestly. “Pete Du-
chelle and Clint Abad are out there,
Donnelly. Both of them jaspers know
how to shoot. I don’t know what
you’re planning—”
  Curtly Donnelly cut him short.
“Shut up. I thought you was a
tough hand, Galt. Better save your
wind— You’ll need it. I’ll get my
He saw the tight line of Dave Galt’s
lips. He knew now that there was a
hat,” said Donnelly,
chink in Galt’s armor.
HE TURNED, awkward on the one
good leg. And in that instant,
swiftly, Dave Galt made his play.
Dave Galt, whose eyes were blind-
folded now but whose hands were
free, lifted a hand in lightning move-
ment and jerked the blindfold from
his eyes. For a fraction of a second
the big man stood balanced on his
toes. Rod Donnelly was in the act of
reaching for a hat hanging from a
wooden peg in the wall.
  In a flash the hook-nosed killer saw
his opportunity; just as swiftly he
grasped i^. His hands were free now;
so were his feet. The blindfold was
torn from his eyes. Weaponless, he
lashed out savagely at Donnelly’s jaw
with his fist. He missed the jaw; the
blow struck Donnelly's shoulder; but
it knocked the one-legged man off
balance and sent him spinning to the
floor. He landed on his hips, gun
lifting. Too late. Dave Galt was al-
ready at the door. Donnelly threw a
shot at him, but Galt was through
the door. Galt was outside, running—
with desperate speed to beat a bullet
at his back.
  And then, as suddenly aa it had
started, it was over. Dave Galt, head
down, was racing toward the black-
smith shop. His whole concern was
to escape a bullet from Donnelly’s gun
and so he was quite unprepared for
what occurred—for the crashing roar
of guns from the blacksmith shop, or
for the bullets that met him before he
had covered half a dozen yards. They
struck the hook-nosed killer, one bul-
let and another; they stopped his
head-long rush and propped him up-
right for a moment, and then Galt’s
knees caved under him.
  Rod Donnelly had crawled to the
window. From the window he watched
the blacksmith shop. He saw the door
of the shop swing open, saw two men
step outside. A tall man and a short
one, they trudged across the snow-
covered ground toward the cabin.
Each man carried a rifle. The tall man
said something to the short man. Both
laughed. They came on. They had
almost reached that twisted figure in
the snow when Donnelly rolled over
into the doorway. Donnelly edged the
thirty-thirty through the door.
  “Get ’em up! he rasped.
 And both men stopped. Pete Du-

75
chelle and Clint Abad. Tough hands
both, but now they were two statues,
frozen into place. Then Lanky Pete
Duchelle looked down at the figure in
the snow.
  “It’s Dave,” he said stupidly.
  The words seemed to break a spell.
Clint Abad flung himself aside, trying
desperately to swing his rifle into
line. The rifle barked from the cabin,
and Abad went down, his gun unfired.
Pete Duchelle managed to get in one
shot, firing his rifle from the hip. The
slug kicked up snow a foot in front of
the cabin doorway. Rod Donnelly took
deliberate aim. His bullet hit Duchelle
in the center of the chest.
  Rod Donnelly watched Duchelle go
down. He lowered the rifle slowly.
Not a killer, he thought. He’d been
unable to shoot a little time back,
when he’d had Dave Galt helpless un-
der his gun. Now, with two killers
trying to get guns into action, he’d
had no trouble squeezing trigger. It
was hard to understand. He let it go.
  It wasn’t over yet. He still had a
long ride ahead of him—twenty miles
to Lige Altman’s ranch on Rock creek.
SAM COLT’S KILLER
  Shortly afterward the father of the
revolver died of his affliction. Just a
few years earlier he had been arrested
for a $400 debt; upon his death he
left an estate valued at $5,000,000. His
armory was making weapons at the
rate of 1,000 per day, and also gun-
making machinery for other armories
all over the world. He did not live to
hear the death knell of his revolving-
breech rifle. Nor did he know that a
new Invention was about to come
upon the scene which would revolu-
tionize the firearm almost as much as
had his own patent: it was the
metallic cartridge.
  However, the Colt armory survived
this new ammunition. And after the
first automatic pistols made their ap-
pearance abroad, his feature was soon
adapted to Colt models, too. Since
then, Colt has been the main supplier
of this through two World Wars and
several local ones, but world com-
petition has increased.
  Of about 200,000 revolvers and
automatics made by Colt annually in
today’s relatively peaceful times,
about 25 per cent are .22 caliber and
He owed Galt's crowd something
there; they'd caught up the horses for
him and put them in the barn. He
was pretty sure he had enough left
to make the ride to Altman's.
  He crawled outside. Pete Duchelle
was dead in the snow. So was Dave
Galt. There was a bloody froth on
Clint Abad's lips, but his eyes were
wide open. He looked at Donnelly.
  “We figgered. . .you was dead,” he
muttered. "Figgered. . . Dave was...
in cabin...”
  Donnelly crawled on. He picked up
the black Stetson hat which had
dropped from Dave Galt's head. It
was his best hat, his town hat. He
rolled Dave Galt over, and patiently
he began to work the dead man out of
the big coat—the black bearskin coat

he said. “That's why I let Galt wear

BLOOD AND
SWEAT - OR
BULLETS?
by L. P. HOLMES
THE TRAVELING man wasn’t
exactly coherent, for which he
could hardly be blamed. For
when a man had been first scared half
to death, then creased with a .45 slug
and left for dead, and finally woke
up to find himself still in the land
of the living, his recollections of what
had happened were bound to be some-
what distorted.
  Of only one thing was he reason-
ably certain. At least two men had
been in on the stage hold-up, and
both were masked. As Sheriff Barney
Carr pieced the picture together from
the drummer’s disjointed story, the
drummer had been dozing and was
awakened when the stage stopped
abruptly. Right away there were two
shots, and the startled drummer had
stuck his head out the stage door just
as Macklin, the shotgun guard had
toppled limp and dead into the dust
right under the drummer’s horrified
eyes. After which the drummer had
just time to throw a single glance
along the road and see the two ban-
dits standing there, both masked,
both with smoking guns. One of the
bandits had cursed, stabbed his gun
level and the drummer’s senses had
left him in a great, flaming crash
of thunder and shock.
  The grizzled old sheriff tried a few
questions in his slow, gentle drawl.
How had the bandits been dressed?
Were they big or little men, or of
medium size? Was there any charac-
teristic of any sort by which they
might be marked?
  To which the drummer mumbled

The lynch mob had already gathered.
 It was a hell of a country
 where a law-abiding cit-
 izen couldn't ride through
 without getting his brain
 blasted out by a .45 slug,
 but Sheriff Carr couldn't
 challenge every side-
 winder in town to guns in

that they were masked, that they had
tried to kill him and that it was a
hell of a country where a law abiding
citizen couldn’t ride through without
getting his brain half battered out by
a .45 slug.
BARNEY CARR looked up at Doc
Oliver and shrugged. Doc
shrugged back. So Barney left and
Doc walked with him as far as the
door. "Maybe when the shock has
worn off he’ll remember something
else. Barney,” said Doc. “If he does,
I’ll let you know.”
 Barney Carr walked slowly back to
his office. Down street the stage
stood in front of the livery barn. The
grizzled old law man had already
looked that over, along with the bod-
ies of Jim Dykes, the driver, and
Shove Macklin, the shotgun guard. So

much for visual evidence. Now he
had to think.
  There would be a lot of bumble-
heads thinking about this too, re-
flected Barney grimly—and probably
jumping at conclusions, like they al-
ways did. And the usual criticism
would begin to be whispered about.
That Barney Carr had been a good
sheriff, but was getting a little old
for the job now. That he spent too
much time sitting around his office
and not enough in the saddle. That if
Longhorn County had a younger
sheriff with plenty of ‘git-up-and-
git’ to him, this sort of murder and
banditry would not take place. That
when next election time rolled around
it might be a good idea if folks
started voting with their heads and
not with their hearts.
  Barney had heard it all before. It
took place every time any sort of a
major crime hit the county. And
those who did most of the criticising
neglected entirely to keep track of
the subsequent arrests and convic-
tions, which, Barney reflected with a
grim and sober pride, had been well
nigh perfect.
  And when they started talking a
younger man for Barney's’ office, the
name most often mentioned was that
of Ed Dow. That was all right with
Barney, for Ed was a good boy. Like
his daddy had been, old Grizzly Dow,
afraid of nothing under the sun.
Strong and rugged, Ed could ride five
horses into the ground and come up
smiling. A better than average hand
with a gun and a good head on him.
But a little too chock full of the bust
’em wide open spirit of ebullient
youth. Which led him to jump at con-
clusions a little too readily. Given
time and the right sort of training,
Ed would make a right smart law
man.
 That was why Barney had hired
Ed on as deputy, though there were
plenty who said at the time that Bar-
ney Carr had pinned a deputy's star
on Ed Dow to move competition from
the field. The fools! Couldn't they get
it through their thick heads that a
good law man had to be trained, same
as for any other profession? That was
the trouble in a lot of counties. They
elected a backslapper, a gent with
swagger and big mouth—and nothing
else. Then wondered why so much
crime danced loose and free across
the range.
  Well, Ed Dow was out with a posse
now at the scene of the hold-up, try-
ing to pick up a trail and run it down.
Maybe it would all turn out that sim-
ple. Once in a while it did. Though
Barney figured this case as being a
little different. There were certain
angles about it which needed think-
ing over. And Barney Carr was still
in his office, thinking over those an-
gles when Ed Dow and the posses
came clattering back into Prairie
City, just at sundown.
  Ed reported immediately, his wide
shouldered, dusty figure filling the
doorway as he came in, chaps swish-
in, spurs clashing.
  “No luck, chief,” he reported suc-
cinctly. “There was a trail—two men.
We followed it clear back into the
Cutbank country. They split up there,
one going east, one west. I sent Tom
Garson and half the posse along one
set of tracks while me and the rest of
the boys followed the other. My set
ended up in Whit Horse Creek and
Tom’s ran out in the Hardin Valley
trail. Both broncs were bare-foot with
nothing about ’em to tell off from any
other set of bare foot bronc tracks.
All we could go on was the orginal
direction of the getaway trail, which
was back into Cutbank. That set Tom
and some of the boys to wondering
about—well, they mentioned the
names of Buck Caspian and Milo
Studinger.”
  “What do you think, kid?” asked
Barney Car quietly.
pD DOW spread his long length in
a chair and built a smoke. He
stirred a little restlessly. “Well,” he
blurted finally—"Caspian and Stud-
inger both got records. They both did
time for this same sort of thing—
stage robbery. And I’ve heard my old
Dad say that a sheep killin’ dog never
gets over his taste fur mutton.”
  Barney Carr nodded slowly. “Some-
thing in what you say. I’m going to
rustle a bite of supper and ride out
to have a talk with Buck and Milo.’*
  “I’ll jog along,” said Ed Dow. '
“Them two jaspers gone bad again,
they'd know right off what you were
riding in for and they’d smoke you
down without giving you a single
73
2-GUN WESTERN
chance for your alley. I’ll go along to
keep an eye...”
  “No,” said Barney Carr. “You’re
staying right here in the office, kid.
Your job will be to keep the fur
smoothed down on the wise ones.
They’ll be drifting in after supper,
to tell you what I should have done,
to hand out advice that nobody wants
and that ain’t worth a damn nohow.
And to criticise; that's the best thing
they do is criticise. You listen and
you'll get a couple of ear-fuls. But it
all comes under the head of expe-
rience.’'
  It was near midnight when Bar-
ney Carr got back to Prairie City. A
light was still going in the office and
when Barney went in he found Ed
Dow waiting for him. Young Ed was
looking a little sullen. After one
swift glance at his deputy, Barney
smiled slightly. “They must have been
rawhiding you and me pretty heavy,
kid. Let’s hear about it.”
 “Rawhiding is a mild word,”
growled Ed Dow. “Chet Shadrow was
in and fit to be tied. He’d been over at
Stone Corral setting up a way station
for the projected stage line he aims
to run into Baker Valley. He didn’t
know a thing about the hold-up until
he got back to town. And then he hit
here, raving. Vinson was down from
the mines and demanding action of
some kind or another. For do you
know what them damned holdup
got off the stage? They got the mine
payroll, that's what they got. Close on
to twelve thousand dollars. Vinson
said the mine owners are going to
yell bloody murder, and as Superin-
tendent, he’s going to be on the spot.
Shadrow is howling because this is
going to be a black mark against his
stage line, besides losing his best
driver and shotgun guard. They’re go-
ing to raise hell and put a rock under
it, them two are, if we don’t get some
kind of results and get ’em in a hurry.
And I don’t know as you can blame
’em. In their place, I’d feel the same.”
  Barney Carr got out his old pipe,
stuffed it and puffed it aglow.
“Along with all their howling, did
they have any suggestions?” he asked
mildly.
  Ed Dow's tone grew a little de-
fiant. “Everybody who was in seemed
to be thinking along the same line.
Buck Caspian and Milo Studinger.
Did you see them two?”
  “Yep. Spent the evening with ’em.
They’re like a pair of tickled kids.
They been digging a well up on that
dry Bald Knob range of theirs and
they hit a swell flow of good water.
That means they can graze that chunk
of range the year round now, instead
of just in the spring. They aim to
put in a wind mill and a couple of
concrete water troughs. Opening up
that Bald Knob range to year round
grazing means they can put some of
their bottom range into alfalfa.
Darned smart, progressive cattlemen,
them two boys.”
  Ed Dow got abruptly to his feet.
“I’m going to turn in,” he growled.
  “Sure,” said Barney Carr. “G’night,
kid.”
  Ed Dow slammed the door behind
him as he went out. Old Barney
smiled grimly. “Think I’m a simple
minded old fool, don’t you, kid?” he
murmured. “Well, youth has to learn,
I reckon.”
BARNEY spent the balance of the
night on the office bunk and met
Ed Dow at breakfast in the hash
house. Ed was still sulky, curt and
uncommunicative. While they were
eating, Chet Shadrow came in, growl-
ing behind his black, bristly beard.
  “Wondering when I’d get a chance
to talk to you, Carr,” he snapped.
“What you aiming to do about that
hold-up?”
  “Why, try and run down the trail,
of course. Golly! The cook sure got
a good brew on the java this morning.
Tie into a cup or two, Chet. Cheer
you up.”
  Shadrow cursed, grabbed Barney
Carr by the arm and jerked him
around. “Listen here, you simple old
coot,” he growled. “You act like that
hold-up was a joke. Well, it ain’t.
Two good men were killed, Jim
Dykes and Shove Macklin. That
drummer nearly got his, too. The
mine payroll was lifted. It is all a
heavy jolt against my stageline. I
don’t see it as any joke. Neither does
Stent Vinson, the mine superinten-
dent. Neither does anybody else
around here who believes in law and
order. And when I start talking seri-
ous business with you, you moon

 over good java. Well, get this
 straight. We want some action on
 this thing. If you can't get it, we’ll
 put that star of yours on somebody
 else who will.”
    Barney Carr blinked. “I aim to get
  some action, Chet—soon as I know
  where the trail leads.”
    “Why don”t you try the trail that
  leads out to the Circle C S?” sneered
  Shadrow. “I've heard it said that Buck
  Caspian and Milo Studinger have had
  experience at robbing stages in the
  past.”
   “Mebbe so,” murmured Barney
 Carr. “But that was in the past. I'd
 say those boys were pretty good citi-
 zens, now. They been digging a well
 up on their Bald Knob range and

    “Listen!” growled the irate stage
  owner. “Maybe you were a good sher-
  iff—in the past. But this is—now!
  And folks are wondering...”
    “Folks are always wondering,” mur-
  mured Barney Carr. “That’s their
  privilege. Well—I got to be going.
  Pour your troubles on Ed. He’s got
  young shoulders and broad ones. You
  stick around, Ed. I got some riding
  to do. Don't know when I’ll be back.”
  Sheriff Barney Carr was gone from
  Prairie City for two whole days and
  nights and during that time he put
  in a heap of riding. He circled almost
  as far out as Baker Valley, came back
  through the Cut Bank country, hit
  the mines on Rawhide Peak where he
  had a talk with Vinson, the superin-
  tendent, then went back to Cut Bank.
  He hit White Horse Creek and the
  Hardin Valley trail, riding circle af-
  ter circle, his weather-puckered eyes
  full of earth-searching scrutiny and
  remote, gathering thought.
    He lived off a box of crackers and
  a chunk of cheese he had picked up
  at the store before leaving Prairie
  City. Both nights he slept on the
  ground, his saddle for a pillow, scanty
  saddle blanket his only covering. He
  seemed to grow more lean and leath-
  ery by the hour, but in those puck-
  ered old eyes a gleam of triumph was
  growing sharper and sharper. And at
  mid-morning of the third day, gaunt
  and dusty, Sheriff Barney Carr
  jogged back toward Prairie City.
On his way in he dropped by at
v the Circle C S for another little talk
with Buck Caspian and Milo Stud-
inger. But the only person about the
ranch was a wrinkled old Mexican,
whom Caspian and Studinger had
hired as a man of all work about the
place. The Mexican was squatted on
his heels in front of the ranchhouse,
and his black eyes, as he looked up to
face the sheriff, were sullen and re-
sentful.
  “Howdy, Pedro," hailed Barney
Carr cheerfully. "Where's Buck and
Milo? Up at the new well?”
PEDRO SPAT deliberately, with a
contempt which made Barney’s
eyes narrow. "They are in jail,” said
Pedro. "You should know that, Senor
Carr. You—who have posed as their
friend. Yes—they are in your jail.”
  Barney Carr was suddenly very
cool and quiet. “Let me get that right,
Pedro. You say Buck and Milo are
in jail. Who arrested them?”
  “Your deputy, of course. Who
would have taken them, if not you?
Ed Dow arrested them, he and a
posse. That, Senor—was black
treachery on your part. And I,
Pedro Lopez have little liking of you
for it.”
  A flash of grim anger showed in
Barney Carr's eyes, then faded to a
cool, calculating gleam. “If I was
responsible for it, I wouldn’t blame
you for feeling that way, Pedro,” he
said. “But I haven't been anywhere
near town for the past two days and
nights and I knew nothing of this.
Nor did I give the order that it should
be done.”
  Pedro searched the sheriff’s face
with a long, intent scrutiny, then
nodded. “I am sorry, Senor,” he said
gravely. “You are not at fault. But 1
would get to town quickly, for among
the posse I heard some talk of lynch-
ing.”
  “Grab a bronc, Pedro,” said Bar-
ney Carr grimly. “We’ll ride in to-
gether.”
  They wasted no time along the
trail, but Barney Carr slowed as they
reached the outskirts of the Prairie
City. The town was crowded, the
single street full of milling riders.
And there was a group of miners
there also. Barney let out a gusty
breath of relief. There was a lynch
mob forming, all right. But it hadn’t
reached the point of insensate, blind
80
2-GUN WESTERN
action yet. Which meant that Buck
Caspian and Milo Studinger were
still safe.
   “Stick around, Pedro," said Bar-
ney. “Nothing to worry about yet. I
got a little chore over at Doc Oliver’s
place.”
  Barney slipped around the back
way to Doc Oliver’s house, which also
contained the doctor's office and a
hospital bed or two. Doc Oliver him-
self let Barney in at the back door.
“About time you were showing up,”
grumbled Doc. “There’ll be a lynch-
ing bee if you don’t do something
pretty quick. They tell me Ed Dow is
sweating blood, worrying over wheth-
er he can protect his prisoners, now
he’s’ got ’em.”
   “Let him sweat,” said Barney. “Do
him good. Teach him something. How
about that drummer, Doc? Is he
thinking a*.y clearer, now?”
   “He's about well enough to travel,
if that’s what you mean. You want
to see him, of course?”
   “Yeah. For a few minutes.”
   The drummer was sitting up in bed,
head encased in a broad, white band-
age. “I know what you want,” he said
peevishly, as soon as Barney entered
the room. “And there is only one
thing I can add to what I told you
before. Thinking everything over,
particularly, how they looked—well,
there were two of them, both masked.
And I can’t recall anything else but
this. The one who shot me when he
cursed and half whirled my way, the
tails of the handkerchief he was
masked with, sort of fluttered aside.
And it seems I recall seeing some-
thing that looked like the edge of a
'beard. I wouldn’t be positive, under-
stand—for the next split second
everything went to pieces in thunder
and lightning. It ain’t much—but it’s
all I can do about it, sheriff.”
  The gleam in Barney Carr’s eyes
had deepened. “You got no idea how
much that little thing means, amigo.
Thanks—a heap.”
  At that moment a wild, deep
throated, concerted yell echoed in
from the street. The drummer
squirmed nervously. “Now what?” he
demanded shrilly. “The crazy, damned
country... !”
  Barney was already on his way
•	out. “Just a few of the boys who
need to have their ideas straightened
out,” he drawled.
THE MOB had made up it’s mind.
The crowd, a full hundred strong,
was massed before the door of the
sheriff’s office, swaying, growling,
cursing—yelling for the prisoners.
Ed Dow stood on the step, facing
that mob. He had a sawed off shot-
gun, held waist high, the twin muz-
zles swinging back and forth in a
threatening arc.
  Sheriff Barney Carr, slipping un-
noticed up to the fringe of the mob,
watched Ed Dow and nodded grimly.
“Worried,” he told himself—“worried
and a little uncertain, the kid is. But
not one damned bit afraid. He’ll do.”
 Then Barney Carr went driving
through the mob and he was no long-
er a shuffling, amiable, easy going old
timer. In some strange and mysteri-
ous way he seemed to have grown tall-
er. His leathery face was grim and
harsh, his puckered eyes full of fluid
ice. Men who turned to curse him
when he shouldered them aside,
quieted suddenly as they glimpsed
that ice in the old man's eyes. And
when a burly miner, somewhat addled
with drink, aimed an angry blow at
Barney Carr, Barney gun-whipped
him with the merciless speed of a
pouncing wolf. And in two more
strides, Barney was up on the steps
beside Ed Dow and turning to face
the mob.
  They yelled when they saw who it
was, yelled taunts and threats. Bar-
ney looked them over coolly, waited
until they quieted. “You’re clawing
at the wrong corral if you think
you’re going to take any prisoners
away from the kid and me,” he told
them harshly. “You might as well
break it up and git. Lynching is out.
That’s final!”
  Ed Dow didn’t say a word, but Bar-
ney heard his deep gulp of relief.
 The mob wanted to argue. “We
want Caspian and Studinger,” yelled
one of them. “We’re going to string
those two damned crooks up. They
should have been hung long ago. You
can’t keep us away from them.”
  Suddenly Barney Car was a snarl-
ing old tiger. He half crouched and
both big guns leaped into his hands.
“That’s what you think!” he spat.
BLOOD AND SWEAT - OR BULLETS?
"Come and get ’em, if you think
you're good enough. Ed, when I say
the word, let ’em have that buckshot
—both barrels. We'll show ’em who
runs the law in these parts!”
  That put it all distinctly up to the
mob and they didn’t like the spot.
They might have rushed Ed Dow,
had he been alone. They might even
have rushed Barney Carr, had he
been alone. But the prospect of rush-
ing both these defenders of the law,
when one held a sawed off shotgun
and the other a pair of ready and
potent six guns—well, that was some-
thing else again.
  Those in the front rank of the mob
began pushing back, away from the
threat of the guns> Those in back and
reasonably safe if the guns should
bark, tried to hold the lines. Soon,
the mob was quarreling and cursing
back and forth among its members.
Barney Carr knew the signs.
  “They don’t want any of it, kid,’’
he told Ed Dow quietly. “They’ll be
heading for the bars to try and drink
their self-respect back pretty quick.”
Barney holstered his guns, lifted an
arm for attention. "I see Chet Chad-
row and Sten Vinson out there,” he
shouted. “They claim to be the most
hurt by that hold-up. I’ll talk com-
promise with ’em—but I won’t be bull-
ied into anything. All right, Shadrow
want to talk it over, we’ll try and hit
some agreement.”
  “Listen, chief,” muttered Ed Dow
in a choked sort of voice, “I ain’t
sure but what I’ve made a damned
fool of myself. But Caspian and Stud-
inger get a fair break before the law.
I don’t stand for them to be turned
over to Shadrow and Vinson on any
kind of a compromise. That goes!”
“Good kid!” murmured Barney
Carr. You’re learning.”
  The mob, knowing its bluff had
been called, and anxious to save its
face, hailed Barney Carr’s proposi-
tion with a yell of approval. Shadrow
and Vinson were shoved forward and
they came up to the steps sullenly.
  “I’m tired, boys,” said Barney Carr.
“My feet hurt. Let's go in and sit
down, where we can talk this over
quiet.”
LIE LED the way in and relaxed
with a sigh behind his battered
old desk. At the rear of the office
was a locked door. This led directly
into the jail in back. Ed Dow moved
over and stood with his back to that
door. He was taking no chances on
Shadrow and Vinson pulling some
surprise move and winning a way
past that door to the two prisoners
beyond. Barney Carr smiled slightly
to himself as he noted the move.
  Shadrow straddled a chair, stocky
and sullenly defiant. Vinson, a thin
faced man of medium size, nervous as
a cat with all the excitement, paced
up and down the room a couple of
times before he sat down.
  “I’m surprised at you two,” said
Barney Carr, in his old, amiable man-
ner. “Last men in the world I’d ex-
pect to see in a mob. That ain’t law
and order and you know it.”
  “It ain’t law and order to let hold-
ups and killers run loose in this coun-
try, either,” growled Chet Shadrow.
“When the man supposed to handle
such things, which is you, Carr, won’t
get off the dime—why then you got
to expect the boys to take things
into their own hands. If Ed Dow
hadn’t listened to reason and gone
out and slapped an arrest on Caspian
and Studinger, them two whelps
might have been clear out of the
county by this time.”
  “Buck and Milo wouldn't have left
the county,” drawled Barney Carr.
“No need of ’em to. They ain’t done
anything wrong. Ed made a mistake
when he went out and arrested them
two. But Ed’s young and anxious to
do his duty. Any kid is liable to get
over-eager and make a mistake. So
I ain’t blaming Ed none. I’m blam-
ing,” and here a distinct edge came
into the old sheriff’s voice— “I’m
blaming them who talked Ed into it.
Which, I’ll gamble, is you, Shadrow—
and you, Vinson. I figured you'd
probably overplay your hand.”
  Shadrow grew very still in his
chair. Vinson stirred, licking his lips.
“What you driving at?” blurted Shad-
row. “I don’t like what you’re hinting
at.”
  “Shouldn't imagine you would,
Shadrow. You’re both under arrest,
of course. I’m charging you with the
murder of Jim Dykes and Shove
Macklin, and for robbing the stage
they were driving and guarding.” Ab-
82
2-GUN WESTERN
ruptly Barney Carr was a watchful
tiger again arfd his puckered eyes
full of ice.
  Shadrow’s laugh was more like a
startled cough than anything else.
“You're loco,” he scoffed. “Don’t
make me laugh. Charging me with
holding up my own stage.”
  “Of course,” said Vinson thinly.
“You’re senile, Carr. I'd be liable to
steal the payroll of my own mine.”
  “Not your mine, Vinson,” rapped
Barney curtly. “You only work there.
Now let’s get down to cases. You
weren’t in town the day of the rob-
bery, were you, Shadrow. You passed
out the story that you were at Stone
Corral. Well, you went out there all
right—in a buckboard. But you didn’t
stay there. You got a saddle bronc
at Stone Corral and told the folks
there you were riding into Baker
Valley to look over the road and see
where it needed fixing for stage
travel. Well, you rode into Baker
Valley all right, but then you cut
back down White Horse Creek where
you met Vinson. I found out at the
mine that Vinson was away during
the time of the hold-up. Shut up!
I’m talking—and don’t try and make
any breaks. Keep an eye on ’em, Ed.”
BARNEY CARR stuffed tobacco
into his old pipe, puffed out a
huge cloud of smoke. His cold eyes
stabbed back and forth at Vinson
and Shadrow as he tolled out his
indictment.
  “So you pulled that holdup. There
was a chance Jim Dykes or Shove
Macklin might have recognized you.
So you shot ’em down—cold. You
thought you’d left that traveling man
dead, too. Then you grabbed the pay-
roll money and headed back into the
Tut Bank country.
  “There you split up. Vinson went
out over the Hardin Valley trail,
which leads right around in back of
Rawhide Peak, where the mines are,
which made it easy for him to slide
back to the mine, soft and cute. Shad-
row, you took, to White Horse Creek
and headed back for Baker Valley.
You thought riding the creek bed
would cover up your tracks. Well, it
did as long as you stayed in it. But
you had to come out of it finally, and
you did. I can show you the exact
■pot.
  “From there you cut across Baker
Valley and back to Stone Corral,
where you got your buckboard and
drove home to town here. And were
very indignant and surprised to hear
about the robbery. And then wasted
no time steering talk toward Buck
Caspian and Milo Studinger. Easy
to blame it on them two boys, because
of their past records. You and Vinson
had that angle all figured, didn't you.
Well, it might have fooled a kid like
Ed Dow, who is just learning this
law game. But it didn’t fool me. I
been too long at the job of sorting
out humans skunks from decent
folks.”
  Ed Dow was listening and watch-
ing like a man mesmerized. Vinson
had a shriveled, hunted look about
him. Shadrow had a hard glare in his
eyes. He laughed harshly.
  “I can just see you presenting that
kind of hairbrained moonshine in any
law court as evidence, Carr. You'd
be put in a straight-jacket, and right-
ly. You'll have to think up something
better than that. Come on, Vinson—
he's crazy as a coot.”
  Shadrow started to get up, but Bar-
ney Carr lashed a whip-like order.
“Stay put! I ain’t through. I got my
best cards to lay on the table—yet!
Twelve thousand dollars in that pay
roll. Pretty nice chunk of cash, split
two ways. Six thousand apiece.
Enough to make up for any loss of
reputation to your precious stage
line, eh Shadrow? And a pretty juicy
chunk to add to your wages, eh Vin-
son?
  “And here is the funny part, the
first angle that started me thinking.
Nobody knew that pay roll money
was coming in. I didn't. Neither did
Ed Dow. And it was a cinch that
Buck Caspian and Milo Studinger
didn’t. No way they could have
learned. But you knew it, Vinson and
you, Shadrow. That fact will make a
big difference in court, Shadrow.
  “Couple of other things. That
drummer saw one thing worth while
before his light went out. He just
remembered it and told me about it
half an hour ago. The mask of the
gent who shot him fluttered aside
and he saw a portion of a beard.
You’re the only man in these parts
who wears a beard, Shadrow. And on
top of that—there’s this!”
BLOOD AND SWEAT - OR BULLETS?

  From an open drawer Barney Carr
pulled a reward notice and slapped
it down, face up, on the desk.
“Wanted for murder and stage rob-
bery,” droned Barney Carr remorse-
lessly. “Chet Sheldon alias ‘Blackie’
Sheldon. And the height and weight
ciata fits'you like a shirt, Shadrow.
A’so, it mentions a scar, across the
left angle of the chin. Which a beard
would come in mighty handy to
cover, if you ask me. We'll have to
call the barber in to shave that set of
whiskers you pack, Shadrow. Just
to be— Ah! You fool—!”
 While Barney Carr had been
speaking, Shadrow's lips had been
peeling back in an ever growing
snarl. Now he bounced away from his
chair like a cornered cat and his
right hand licked under his vest and
came away bearing the blue-black
bulk of snub nosed shoulder holster
gun. But he got the weapon no far-
ther than just into the clear when one
of Barney Carr’s guns stabbed across
the desk top and coughed heavily.
  Chet Shadrow staggered back,
dropped his gun, made some blind
and aimless passes before his face
with loose and wobbling hands, spun
slowly and crashed down, shot
through the heart.
  Barney Carr was up and leaning
across his desk, smoking gun bearing
on Stent Vinson. “Don't you try it,
Vinson!" rapped Barney. “You’d
liave no better luck!”
  Vinson wasn’t trying anything. He
was shriveled down in his chair, face
and eyes ghastly. He had to gnaw
at his shaking lips before he could
get out a word. “It was all—his idea,”
stammered Vinson shrilly. “And he
did the—the killing. He shot Dykes
and—and Macklin. I swear he did. I
swear it—I—”
  “All right, Ed.” broke in Barney
Carr. ‘“You turn Buck Caspian and
1.1 ilo Studinger loose. We got a real
prisoner, now."
IT WAS GETTING on toward sun-
down. Sheriff Barney Carr had
been making up for lost sleep on the
office bunk. Ed Dow was out around
town, telling the world that the best
and smartest sheriff in forty-eight
states was Barney Carr. And if any-
body wanted to say different, they
had him, Ed Dow, to lick. Nobody
did.
 Barney was awake when Ed Dow
came back in. For the first time since
the showdown, they were alone. Ed
Dow took off his deputy's badge
and laid it on the desk. Barney
yawned. “What’s that for, kid?” he
asked cheerfully.
  “I ain’t got brains enough to be a
law man,” mumbled Ed. “I’m going
back to punching cows, where a
strong back counts.”
  "You put that badge right back on,
where it belongs,” growled Barney.
“You're doing all right. You’re doing
fine. Shucks! I came near muffing
things myself. Take that reward pos-
ter. I nearly chucked it away half
a dozen times. I’d had it so long. But
each time I looked at it I got the
feeling that I’d seen that hombre
somewhere. So I kept it. And not
until I come to suspect Shadrow did
I realize who the poster was a picture
of. If I hadn’t been able to flash that
on him, chances are I could never
have bluffed him into a betraying
break. Because I was guessing plenty.
In this game you got to do that, once
in a while. You got to learn all the
angles.”
  “And me arresting Buck and Milo,”
growled Ed. “When was there ever
such a clunk headed fool!”
 Barney chuckled. “Everybody
makes mistakes, kid. And everybody
has to learn. Any law man needs
training. Put that badge back where
it belongs and we’ll go eat.”

  KILLER’S
 HERITAGE
by NORMAN A. FOX
     HOUGH the blue shadows of
night were crowding down
1 from the surrounding peaks,
Webb Freeman could still see many
miles of the wild tangled Mustang
country from his porch steps. Hunk-
ered there, his long body folded into
an inverted N, the old rancher had
identified the riders toiling up the
trail from town long before Sheriff
Anvil Shane and his posse were with-
in hailing distance. It gave Webb
time to prepare himself for their
coming but Webb was not a top-hand
at deception and his heart was
hammering when the lawman dis-
mounted before his gate.
  The posse sat their horses in si-
lence beyond the ranchyard fence and
Webb was glad Anvil Shane was com-
ing in alone. He and the sheriff had
been friends for more years than
either could remember. Even though
things were shaping themselves to
ruin that friendship, Webb knew he
should be glad to see Shane so he
mustered a smile as the squat, solid-
looking lawman came on.
  “How-do, Anvil,” he jerked. “How
come yuh're galavantin’ away up here
this time o’ evenin’?”
  Shane’s gray mustache drooped as
though it were I":."'!’*":"":

all day,” he replied, “lookin’ for a
trail that ain't.”
  “The Jumping Jack?” Webb asked.
  "Yeah. That black-masked hellion
held up the night stage from Missou-
la again. But this time it’s murder.”
  “Murder!”' Webb echoed.
  “Shorty Dale, the shot-gun guard,”
Shane amplified. “Shorty made a
damn-fool play at the wrong time and
the Jumping Jack got him plumb
center.”
  Webb puckered his seamed face,
tried to whistle his amazement but
the chill coursing through him froze
his lips. If Shane had looked at him
then, the sheriff would have read the
fear in Webb”s face. But Shane's
eyes were probing about the ranch-
yard. Webb Freeman’s spread had
seen better days, for blackleg had
taken a lot of his cattle the season
before but Webb knew Shane wasn’t
looking for the signs of his poverty.
  “Bert around?”
  “My boy? Nope. Sent him to comb
a few strays out o' the timber,” Webb
replied. “We're kinda short of ready
cash hereabouts so I thought I'd have
Bert drive some stock to the butcher
at Mustang.”
ANVIL SHANE digested the in-
formation thoughtfully, tugged
at his moustache. And Webb, who
knew Shane better than he knew any
man, recognized that tell-tale symp-
tom. There was something the sheriff
wanted to say but didn't know how
to word.
  “Yuh wanted tuh see Bert?” Webb
encouraged.
  “No-o-o,” Shane countered. “You
might keep Bert close to the place,
though.” He paused, reddened,
blurted on: “The whole country's
just about loco account of this Jump-
ing Jack. Folks don't always think
straight when they’re riled up and
they’re apt to be suspicious of a shad-
ow. Bert does a lot of lopin' around
by his lonesome..
  The words stiffened Webb. Anvil
Shane was voicing Webb’s own sus-
picions but it hurt like blazes to have
someone else point an accusing
finger at Bert Freeman. Something
akin to wrath tinged Webb's tone
when he spoke.
 “Yuh mean folks think my boy's
the Jumpin' Jack?”
  “Now don’t get het up,” Shane said
soothingly. “Half the country is sus-
picious of the other half. Look at it
this way, Webb. You’re broke, need
money. You been a damn good dad to
Bert and the younker would probably
do anything to help you out. Bert's
about twenty, ain’t he? Just at the
wild age when a younker’s mady to
do a man's work but ain’t got a man’s
judgment. You see how it adds up?”
 “And that’s what yuh believe?”
Webb asked weakly.
  Anvil Shane rested a friendly hand
on the oldster's shoulder. "Bert's
your son—which means he couldn’t be
anything but straight,” the sheriff
said softly. “I’m just showin’ you
how a lot of folks might figger
things. I'm just suggestin’ you keep
Bert home so nobody can talk.”
  The kindness in his voice warmed
old Webb Freeman. That speech was
like Anvil Shane, typical of his gener-
ous heart. Webb had voted for his
old friend election after election and
he could understand why the people
of Mustang had unanimously fol-
lowed suit. Shane was worth it. Webb
raised grateful eyes, was framing a
reply when one of the posse called
the sheriff.
 “Come on,” the fellow shouted.
“Don’t chin all night, Shane. We got
to be riding.”
 Webb recognized that petulant
voice just as he recognized its fancy-
garbed wasp-waisted owner. Tate
Jervis was branch manager of the
Western Overland Stage Company
at Mustang and Webb understood
the man’s eagerness to be on the trail.
The mysterious black-masked bandit
had been dubbed the Jumping Jack
because he had flitted from holdup
to holdup. But mostly the Jumping
Jack had concentrated on the gold-
laden stages of the Western Over-
land. The head office at Helena had
offered five thousand dollars reward
for his capture. Rumor had it they
were riding Tate Jervis pretty hard,
prodding him for action on the mat-
ter.
  So Webb watched Anvil Shane join
Jervis and the others, gallop on up
the trail. Then Webb sat alone on
the steps and the shadows gradually
86
2-GUN WESTERN
 blurring out the surroundings were
 no blacker than his thoughts.
   Anvil Shane had denied that the
 suspicions against Bert were his own
 but the sheriff hadn't fooled Webb.
 Shane was giving Bert Freeman the
 benefit of doubt because Anvil Shane
 and Webb had began ^a friendship in
 Texas thirty years before. That
 friendship had matured here in
 Montana where both men had mi-
 grated. Shane and old Webb had been
 mighty close but there was one phase
 of Webb's life that Anvil Shane
 didn’t know.
 ANVIL SHANE didn’t know about
 the early years of Webb's mar-
 ried life. Shane had been pushing
 cattle north in those days. True,
 '' Shane had probably heard of Wild
 Bill Leatherby, the Texas badman,
 who had been corraled and sent to
 prison for twenty years. But Shane
 didn't know Webb and his wife had
 adopted the infant son of Wild Bill
 Leatherby to bless their childless
 marriage.
  That was Webb’s secret, and
 Webb’s alone. His wife had died a
 dozen years before and Wild Bill
 Leatherby was lost among the shad-
 ows of the past. So Webb had been
 living with fear and uncertainty
 since the Jumping Jack had began to
 ride. Webb had reared Bert by the
 same rigid code of honesty that had
 governed Webb's own life. But blood
 is blood—and Bert Freeman was the
 son of Wild Bill Leatherby, bad-
 man.
   The dead past had refused to stay
 buried, Webb reflected bitterly. He
 called Bert his son and the boy was
 everything to him that the word im-
 plied. He thought of it now and felt
 very old and very much alone. Then,
 as though summoned genii-like by
 his thoughts, Bert Freeman dis-
 mounted at the corral, headed for the
 house.
   Bert might have been his kin for
 the boy was tall and lath-like too.
 His shock of hair was the same blue-
 black that Webb’s had been before
 the years had thinned it and
 sprinkled it with gray. Slumping
 down beside his foster father, the boy
 grinned wanly.
   “Left the beef in the corral up at
 the line shack,” he reported. “I’ll
drive ’em down to Mustang come
morning.”
 Webb remembered Anvil Shane's
advice about keeping Bert at home
but only grunted. After all, Bert was
twenty, a man by range standards.
Bert had taken a lot of the work
from Webb’s shoulders. He couldn’t
order the boy to hang around the
ranch-yard from now on.
  His hands were tied by Bert's ma-
turity and next morning he watched
silently as Bert rode away. It was
the beginning of a week of sheer tor-
ture for the lanky oldster for each
day the boy found something to keep
him in the saddle and Webb was
usually in bed when Bert returned
by night. They always met at break-
fast and, facing the boy across the
table, Webb' would choke back
thronging questions he wanted to
ask and couldn't.
  Once Webb saddled up, rode down
to Mustang. There were supplies to
be bought but, afterwards, Webb
prodded himself into the sheriff's
office. Anvil Shane greeted him
wearily and gave him the information
he wanted.
  "Yep, the Jumping Jack held up a
prospector night afore last,” Shane
reported.
  There were new worry lines etched
in S'.iane's broad face and a heap of
untouched correspondence was piled
upon his desk. Webb didn’t linger
and he almost collided with Tate
Jervis as he went through the door.
The carefully-dressed Western Over-
land manager gave Webb a long
searching glance as the oldster
grunted his apology.
  Afterwards Webb toiled up the hill
trail to the ranch and found Bert ab-
sent. Nor did the boy show up for
supper. Webb spent another solitary
evening brooding on the porch steps
and went to bed early. But his
thoughts made for sleeplessness. He
wondered where Bert was riding—
and why. And he was still wondering
when Bert came in hours later. He
heard the boy steal along the hall,
pause for a moment at Webb's bed-
room door. Then, apparently deciding
the oldster was asleep, Bert went to
his own room.
FOR LONG moments Webb lay
there listening. Then, impelled by
KILLER'S HERITAGE
87
some undefinable urge, he rose, picked
up his boots and tiptoed to the porch.
Pulling on the boots, he started for
the barn, a phantom-like figure in his
flapping white nightgown. The
breeze chilled him and he was glad
to reach the shelter of the barn where
he fumbled for a lantern.
  Bert’s horse, a deep-chested roan,
was in its stall and saddle and gear
were tossed over the stall partition.
Webb peered about uncertainly, over-
whelmed by the fact that he did not
know what he sought. The roan had
its nose in a ration of oats and, with-
out forethought, Webb plunged his
hand into the oat bin. His probing
fingers closed on something buried
there and he drew the object into
view. Moving the lantern closer, he
examined his find and his eyes wid-
ened with horror.
  Many men had seen the Jumping
Jack and all of the victims had re-
ported like descriptions—a tall man
dressed in nondescript range garb
and wearing a black mask. Sometimes
the details of the garb varied but al-
ways that black mask had been the
insignia of the Jumping Jack. And
Webb was clutching such a mask in
his trembling fingers.
  He thrust the mask back into the
oat bin, blew out the lantern and
reeled toward the house. And the
night breeze sighing down from the
peaks seemed to carry the mocking
laughter of Wild Bill Leatherby to
him. It was like the death knell of a
lifetime's hopes. He had tried to
mould Bert Freeman after himself
but wild blood had had its way.
  Webb carried that hideous thought
to bed with him and it kept him toss-
ing and turning until sunup. When
he awoke from fitful slumber, Bert
had left. But Webb was glad he
didn’t have to face his foster son
this morning—and he was glad to be
alone to fight the battle he would
have to fight.
 All through the long day he
wrestled with his problem. What was
he to do with his knowledge? A doz-
en times he thought of facing Bert
with an accusation but discarded the
notion. Bert would naturally deny
everything. It would be far better to
go to Sheriff Anvil Shane, lay the
facts before him, Webb owed that
much to his old friend. But Webb
knew that to do so would be like
betraying his own flesh and blood.
  And then, when the shadows were
spilling from thf peaks once again,
Webb heard a clatter of hoofs and
when he hurried to the door Sheriff
Anvil Shane was dismounting before
the gate.
  They had arrested Bert! All day
Webb had contemplated betraying
the boy to the law himself but sight
of the squat lawman filled him with
panic. Shane’s first words dispelled
Webb’s fear, however.
  “I’m still trailin’ the Jumpin’ Jack,
Webb,” the lawman said as he was
ushered to the living room. “Thought
I’d drop in this way.”
  “Reckon yuh’ll cut his sign one of
these days,” Webb ventured.
  “Maybe so,” Shane reflected and
the proffered rocking chair creaked
with his weight. “Me, I’m tryin’
mighty hard. Had an idea to start
checkin’ on everybody workin’ for
Western Overland seein’ is how that
hellion always seems to know when
a gold shipment's cornin’ through.
Tate Jervis reckoned it was a good
idea but figgered it would take too
long. Seems like Western Overland
is hollerin’ for blood—and pronto—
so Tate’s got a better idea.”
  “Tate’s a smart hombre.”
  “A gold shipment's cornin’ over
from Missoula tomorrow aft-ernoon,”
Shane went on. “Tate’s having a spe-
cial driver and a special shot-gun
guard, hand-picked men. Likewise
Tate’s riding the stage hisself this
time and he’s a good hand with a gun.
He’s asked me to come along so
they'll be four of us all primed for
trouble. If the Jumping Jack stops
us, one of us is bound to get a chance
to make a play. The reward is to be
split four ways.”
  “Ought to be a cinch if the hom-
bre shows up,” Webb said and his
eyes drilled into Shane's “Just why
yuh tellin’ me all this, Anvil?”
'THE DIRECTNESS of the ques-
tion staggered Anvil Shane. He
stared wordlessly, one hand tugging
at his moustache. Webb knew that
once again Shane had something to
say and didn't know how to say it.
“Spill it,” he urged the lawman.
88
2-GUN WESTERN
 “Wa-al, I don’t exactly know
where to begin,” Shane stammered.
“Yuh see, Webb, this being a lawdog
is a tough job. A gent sorta has to
forget he's human and that's mighty
hard sometimes. Reckon every sheriff
has a day when he wonders which
he’s gonna serve—his badge or his-
6elf. And when a gent’s had hisself
pulled out of the Canadian on a trail
drive and nursed through a seige of
smallpox, it's sorta hard to for-
get...”
  “If I saved yore carcass a couple
of times,” Webb interjected feeling-
ly, “it was because I had the chance.
Reckon yuh’d ’a’ done likewise.”
  "Just the same, a lot of water's
gone under the bridge for us two,
old-timer,” Anvil Shane said, hushed-
voiced. “So here's my say-so. If
the Jumping Jack shows up to-
morrow, he’ll get cut to pieces. It’s
my job to jail that gent—and maybe
I’ll have to do it some day. But
there's a helluva lot of difference
between jailin’ a hombre and spillin’
his guts with a scattergun!”
  “I savvy,” Webb said evenly. “I sav-
vy and I’m thankin’ yuh, pard.”
  His words trailed away for a shad-
ow had fallen between the two men
as Bert Freeman stood framed in the
doorway. For a moment he paused
there. Nodding cordially, he strode
through the room and into the kitch-
en.
  Watching him go, Webb wondered
how long Bert had been on the porch,
how much of the talk he had heard.
And wondering, he remembered the
things he, Webb, might say to the
sheriff. But Webb’s tongue was
locked.
  Anvil Shane wasn't sure Bert was
the Jumping Jack. Otherwise the
sheriff would be doing his duty—ar-
resting Bert. At showdown Shane
would be true to his badge but for
the time being he had side-stepped
duty to warn Webb of the death trap
waiting the Jumping Jack. And with
Bert out there in the kitchen, Webb
knew he was going to side-step his
obvious duty too.
  He walked to the gate with Shane
in silence and when the lawman clam-
bered into his saddle Webb shook
his hand, a long, hard grasp eloquent
or his unspoken gratitude. Then he
watched Shane lope away.
 Returning to the house, Webb
found Bert preparing supper. The
oldster helped. Bert, facing him
across the table later, spoke for the
first time.
  "Wasn’t the sheriff saying some-
thing about a trap for the Jumping
Jack just before I walked in?” he
asked between mouthfuls.
  “Yes,” Webb replied and avoided
Bert's eyes. “Of course it’s sort of
confidential like, but the stage will
be loaded with gunnies tomorrow.
They'll get that gent for shore if he’s
crazy enough to show up.”
  Covertly he watched for a sign as
he spoke but Bert gave none. Still,
the warning had been passed along.
At least Bert wouldn’t tackle the
Missoula stage on the morrow. Webb
carried that consolation to bed with
him and was gladened next day to
see that Bert lingered near the ranch
house.
TUDYING him from the porch,
Webb knew the first measure of
contentment he had tasted in a long
time. Perhaps the news of the gun-
trap had sobered Bert, started him
thinking of the odds that are perpet-
ually stacked against those who ride
the owlhoot. Maybe Shane would
never learn the whole truth and Bert
might still become the kind of son
Webb had hoped he would be.
  Those were peaceful thoughts and,
lingering over them, Webb felt as
though a load had been lifted from
his heart. His chin sank upon his
chest for it was a warm, pleasant day
and under the spell of the smiling
skies and his re-born hopes he began
to doze.
  He awoke with a start. Shadows
were spearing downward and the day
was dying fast. Coming to his feet,
Webb entered the house, found it
empty. Half-stunned by a budding
fear, he lurched into the yard, called
Bert’s name. Only his echo answered
him.
  Bert was gone! And with the reali-
zation, Webb knew Bert had gone to
stop the Missoula stage. The boy had
been warned but there was one thing
Webb had forgotten, a thing Anvil
Shane had put into words when he
had said Bert was ready for a man's
work but didn't have a man’s judg-
ment. For Bert, with all the self-
KILLER'S HERITAGE
89
assurance of Wild Bill Leatherby,
had undoubtedly reasoned he could
turn the tables, having been fore-
warned about the gun-trap.
  Webb thought it all out as he
tossed gear onto his horse. Then,
bolting for the house, he stopped to
don a holster-laden belt that he
hadn’t worn for a long time. He
looked to his gun as he clattered
down the trail and found it ready
for work.
  No definite plan shaped itself as
he galloped along. He would let cir-
cumstances take care of themselves
when he reached trail's end. And
trail’s end would be far below where
Lobo Canyon cut through the Mus-
tang country, walling in the road
that squirmed among the hills.
  Mentally charting the country
ahead, Webb had a sudden hunch.
Less than ten miles out of Mustang
a spring bubbled beside the canyon
road. The stage always stopped there
to allow the passengers time to drink
and to stretch their travel-cramped
limbs. The canyon’s walls sloped
gently at this spot. The country was
bush-mottled, a perfect place for a
lone bandit to lie in hiding, waiting
the advantage that would be his when
the passengers spilled from the stage
to drink.
 Accordingly, Webb nosed his
mount toward the promontory look-
ing down on the springs. Nearing it,
he dismounted, stalked forward on
foot. It was well he had adopted
caution for his hunch was correct.
Crouching among the bushes at the
canyon’s crest was the lanky form
of Bert Freeman.
  Webb hadn’t arrived a minute too
soon. The portion of the road below
that he glimpsed was empty but he
could hear the creak of the stage, the
cracking driver’s’ whip, and he knew
the death-laden coach was just around
a turn. And Bert was ready to strike.
He hadn't donned the black mask yet
but he was looking to his gun, testing
the hammer action. Satisfied, he eased
the weapon back into leather again
and at that moment Webb moved for-
ward.
  Three long, lunging strides brought
him to his foster son’s side. Jabbing
his gun into Bert’s’ spine, he snatched
the boy’s weapon, thrust it into his
own belt. Bert stiffened, turned his
head and dismay creased his face.
"Dad!” he gasped.
  "Yes,” said Webb, “it's’ me, son,
and I”m sorry it had to be me. I'd
like tuh think that what yuh’ve been
doing, yuh been doing to help me out.
I’d like to think yuh didn’t mean to
cut down on Shorty Dale. But what I
think don’t count for much. Yuh see,
son, I know yuh’re the Jumpin' Jack.
I found the mask.”
  “You’re. . .you're makin’ a mistake,
Dad,” Bert blurted. “You...”
 “Nope,” Webb said. “I’m not mak-
in’ a mistake this time. I made my
mistake a long spell ago but...”
HIS WORDS choked him. He had
been ready to say his mistake
had been in adopting the son of Wild
Bill Leatherby. But gazing at the boy
over the barrel of a gun, sudden
moisture stung the oldster’s eyes as
he knew a stunning truth. Regardless
of Bert's Freeman’s wild blood, re-
gardless of the tragic outcome to the
boy's career, he had raised this
youngster. For years he had made
himself believe Bert was really his
kin until the thought had become an
actuality. And even now at the bitter
end, Webb Freeman didn't want to
change that.
 But regardless of his feelings,
Webb’s duty lay clear before him.
Anvil Shane had given Bert the bene-
fit of doubt because of a long-fos-
tered friendship and Webb had been
content to take advantage of their
friendship and still his own con-
science. Bert had spoiled that by com-
ing here, showing his hand. There
was nothing left to do but turn Bert
over to the sheriff.
 The stage had jerked to a bone-
jolting stop below. Anvil Shane was
piling from the big Concord and
wasp-waisted Tate Jervis was easing
to the ground after him. With a nod
of his head, Webb indicated the trail
leading downward.
  “Move on below, Bert,” he said.
 Bert opened his mouth to speak
but Webb never heard him. For Webb
himself was suddenly shouting, a
horror-inspired shriek. By the road-
side Anvil Shane had thrown himself
prone to the ground to bury his face
in the bubbling spring. Tate Jervis
90
2-GUN WESTERN
was palming a gun, leveling it at the
sprawling lawman!
  The gun spoke but Webb had saved
his old friend's life. His ear-splitting
shout had disconcerted Jervis just as
the man's finger squeezed the trigger
and Shane had lifted his head to
listen. The bullet that would have
buried itself in the lawman’s brain
grazed his head and Shane sank for-
ward unconscious.
  Then Tate Jervis raised panic-
stricken eyes, glimpsed the two on
the crest of the canyon. With a hoarse
bellow of rage and fear, Jervis fired
at them even as he hurled words at
the driver and the shot-gun guard.
  “Gun them two!” he bellowed.
“They saw me shoot Shane!”
 Webb was charging downward,
Bert beside him. There was a lot the
oldster couldn’t understand about the
thing he had witnessed but certain
facts were obvious enough. One was
that Tate Jervis had tried to kill An-
vil Shane. And the guard and driver
were involved too. All three were
plainly bent on killing the witnesses
for bullets buzzed about the Freemans
as they dodged and twisted.
  Webb wasted no time wondering
about the deal. His gun was answer-
ing the challenge of those below and
then he rememebered Bert was un-
armed. Snatching the extra weapon
from his belt, he passed it over word-
lessly and both went into action.
  The guard with his scattergun was
the deadliest menace as they came
into close range and Webb broke the
man in the middle with a snap shot.
But Jervis had truly hand-picked his
driver and Jervis himself was no
slouch with a six. Both were spray-
ing lead that was finding marks and
Webb cursed as his thigh flamed with
agony.
  But Bert was shooting now and
Webb's eyes snapped wide as he saw
the deadly efficiency of his foster
son. Bert's gun bucked once, a care-
less shot apparently, and the driver
reared upward, sprawled head fore-
most to the road. It was miraculous
Bhooting and suddenly Webb under-
stood its meaning. This was Bert's
heritage! Whatever else the boy had
or hadn’t gotten from Wild Bill
Leatherby, his was the same deadly
hand as his owlhoot sire's.
THEN BERT crumpled. While he
had been gunning the driver Tate
Jervis had utilized the moment to aim
at the boy. The bullet had struck
Bert in the leg. With a fierce yell of
rage, Webb brought up his own gun,
eared back the hammer and Tate
Jervis was slammed against the stage
to slip lifeless to the ground.
  Bloody and disheveled, Webb Free-
man stood panting. His oldest friend
still lay silently beside the spring but
though his heart went out to Anvil
Shane, it was Bert that he turned to.
Wincing with pain, Webb kneeled,
gathered the boy in his arms and
something clogged the oldster's
throat when he spoke.
  “I don't savvy this set-up a-tall.”
Webb said. "But I do savvy yore gun
saved my bacon today, son...”
  A bullet had furrowed Bert’s scalp
and the boy grinned through a bloody
mask. "There’s things I was gonna
say before the fireworks started,
Dad,” he said. “Maybe they'll help
you savvy. You see, I've been trailin’
the Jumpin' Jack for weeks. I fin-
gered that five thousand reward
would come in mighty handy out our
way. When you told me about the
gun-trap set for today, I figgered it
was my last chance. Either 1 got the
bandit before he stepped into the
trap—or not at all. So I rode out here
to lay for him. ..”
  “But Jeivis tried tuh shoot Anvil,”
Webb muttered in bewilderment and
then the light of truth dawned upon
him.. “I savvy,” he ejaculated. “Jervis
was the Jumping Jack! Shore
enough! When Anvil figgered on
checkin' on the gents workin’ for
Western Overland, Tate got woriied
seein' as Anvil was gettin’ close to
the truth. So Tate talked Anvil intuh
takin' this ride along with him and
these other two jaspers who must ‘a’
been helpin’ Tate all along. Tate
probably figgered on gettin’ rid of
Anvil and grabbing this gold ship-
ment at the same time. Afterwards
they’d ‘a’ reported that the Jumpin’
Jack had did the job!”
  “It all fits,” Bert ruminated slowly.
“I found a black mask near the West-
ern Overland office but I didn’t savvy
at the time.” His grin broadened.
“And you found the mask out in the
barn. Reckon I can savvy how things

HARDCASE OR COWARD?
The years had hardened Kent Varing, turned him into
a bitter, cold-eyed man whose law lay in his lightning-
fast guns. No mere slip of a girl could turn him back
_ from the dark trails now....
Varing, riding next to Kilrain, fol-
lowed the gaze of the outlaw leader.
Smoke was curling lazily from the
mud chimney of the cabin that hud-
dled amid gaunt cottonwoods at the
foot of a decline three hundred yards
away. The place looked desperately
poor, but neat. At the back of the
entire length; its southern outlet was
a thin cleft in the hills that was a
gateway into Mexico. In spots, it was
really a canyon. One of these spots
was just beyond the cabin, where the
granite walls drew in till they almost
touched.
  “That won’t do,” Russ Kilrain was
RUSS KILRAIN cursed sudden-
ly, with angry surprise, and his
upraised hand halted the five
hardfaced riders behind him.
“What the hell!” Kilrain growled.
“Somebody’s took up in that old shack
down there. That's bad luck, for who-
ever it is. It means another killin’!”
The smoky, reckless eyes of Kent
cabin was a fenced garden, green with
young vegetables. A few scrawny
cows grazed nearby.
 Kent Varing’s eyes shifted and
probed thoughtfully the length of the
narrow valley along which they had
been riding. It began with the hills
that rimmed the northern end of San
Simon Basin, and traversed the basin's

saying. “We’ve got to drive cattle
through here. We cain’t afford to
have somebody in that shack. They
might talk, and cause trouble. Varing,
you got any idea who it might be?”
Kent Varing, muscularly lean body
slouched in his Texas saddle, shook
his dark head. He said, "Likely a
stranger, somebody who hasn’t heard
it’s sudden death to squat hereabouts,
or a nester with a bunch of kids.”
"They've got to get out, whoever it
is,’’ Kilrain scowled. “First, though,
we’ll give ’em a chance to leave peace-
able. Varing, you’re acquainted in the
basin, and yore picture ain’t on pieces
of card-board all over the country.
You ease down there and look things
over. We’ll wait here.”
  Kent Varing touched spurs to his
big dun, rode through the screening
thicket of cedars and toward the cab-
in. A tight, sardonic smile twisted his
lips as he rode. Despite the fact that
his home range was only twenty miles
away, in the northern end of the ba-
sin, the odds were against his know-
ing whoever was in that dilapidated
cabin. He’d been away almost five
years.
The transformation
wrought by those five years, Kent
Varing realized, was bad. The basin
had known him as a wild, but honest,
good-natured buckaroo. Folks had
grinned and predicted that slim, red-
haired Barbara Wayne would tame
him. But, a week before her scheduled
marriage to Kent Varing, Barbara
Wayne had suddenly and without ex-
planation married handsome Jack
Ivor, and the devils that were in Kent
Varing’s heart burst their bonds.
  He’d sworn to kill Ivor. But dud-
ish, whiskey-drinking Jack Ivor, son
of a well-to-do cowman, had turned
yellow and refused to fight. So Kent
Varing had ridden away, swearing
never to return. The last year he’d
been riding with Russ Kilrain’s gang
over in New Mexico. Kilrain had once
operated here in the San Simon, run-
ning stolen cattle into Mexico, but for
the last year he’d been away while
things cooled off.
  And now Kilrain was riding back,
Kent Varing with him. Varing had
thought, “This is my chance to get
even with that yella skunk, Jack Ivor.
I’ll help break him, then kill him!”
The years had hardened Kent Var-
ing, turned him into a bitter, cold-
eyed hombre whose law lay in his
lightning-fast guns. He’d severed all
ties with the past, except for the
memories he couldn’t crowd out....
  A spotted puppy bounded from the
porch and came barking and nipping
at the dun’s legs as Varing rode up
and stopped. Drawn by the racket, a
wide-eyed, curly-haired boy of no
more than four, came onto the porch
and stared solemnly at Kent Varing.
  Varing dismounted, his silver spurs
jingling as he placed one shiny boot
on the porch. He asked, “You here all
alone, sonny?”
  "You ain’t my daddy,” lisped the
youngster, backing away. He called,
“Mummy! Mummy!”
  Footsteps sounded inside, and a low
voice asked, “What is it, Billy? Ia
somebody...?” The voice dwindled
to silence.
  Kent Varing had thought he was
imune to shock. But something almost
like a physical blow shook him as his
gaze lifted to the woman in the door-
way. This was not the figure of his
dreams that he’d seen in the red heart
of a hundred campfires, but living
flesh and blood.
  Barbara whispered, “Kent—Kent
Varing! Why—why...”
  The years had changed Barbara too.
Still slim and pretty, but there was a
haunting sadness about her violet
eyes. She looked thin, tired, and her
hands were toil-worn. She stood there
looking at Varing, bewilderment in
her eyes.
  Varing fought to steady his whirl-
ing mind. Barbara—here! He was con-
scious of resentment for the fact that
she was still able to make him feel
fierce emotions. Affecting a casual-
ness he didn’t feel, Kent Varing
doffed his cream sombrero, smiled
tautly.
  He said, "I’m sorry, Barbara. I—
didn’t know you were here.”
  The youngster was tugging at his
mother's skirts. “That ain’t my dad-
dy,” he piped. “Who is it, Mummy?”
Barbara said, “Hush, Billy.” Then
to Kent Varing, “I—won’t you come
in, Kent? You look tired, and hun-
gry”
  On an impulse, Kent Varing went

into the cabin. The room was neat and
clean, but almost bare of furnishings.
It showed evidence of desperate pov-
erty.
  Varing asked abruptly, “Barbara,
why are you here?”
  Her face pale and still, she said,
“I live here.”
  “And Jack Ivor...?”
  “He lives here too. This is our son,
Billy. He was born soon after you—
went away.”
 “Jack Ivor brought you here—to
live?”
WISTFUL smile touched her red
lips. “Why not? There was no-
where else to go.”
  Questions hammered at Kent Var-
ing's mind, and memories flooded
through him. When Barbara Wayne
had married Jack Ivor, without warn-
ing or explanation, it had cut deeply.
It had shattered his faith in humani-
ty. Barbara’s head had been turned
by Jack Ivor’s fancy clothes and
flashy good looks, and by the pros-
pect of spending some of old Buck
Ivor's cattle money, Varing had
thought.
 Five years ago, Buck Ivor had
owned a big cow outfit. Jack Ivor
had had money to squander on whis-
key and cards and women. Why, then,
was Barbara here in this squalid
shack?
  “There was nowhere else to go,”
Barbara said simply, uncomplaining-
ly. “Soon after we were married.
Jack’s father died. He left us the
ranch. But things didn’t go well. We
lost cattle. Drought came. Things
went from bad to worse, and we lost
the ranch, everything. That was a
year and a half ago.”
  There was a brave tilt to Barbara’s
chin as she talked. Kent Varing sav-
vied what had happened, as much
from what she left unsaid as the
things she said. She was still loyal to
Jack Ivor. She didn’t say that Jack
Ivor had gambled their ranch away,
and spent it on whiskey and dance
hall flossies, but Kent Varing knew
that was what had happened. She
didn’t admit that she'd married a
weakling and a coward, but Varing
knew that that knowledge too was
in her mind.
  “So we came here,” she went on as
if talking helped her. “We just moved
in. Nobody would live here; the place
was supposed to be haunted, or some-
thing. Everybody who'd ever tried to
live here had been killed, or scared
away. But we didn't have any choice.
We've lived here a year and a half
and nothing’s happened. There’s not
much room, but the ground’s fertile.
We have a garden, and raise a few
cattle. ...”
  Kent Varing listened as she talked
on. She was trying pitifully to con-
vince him that she was happy and
satisfied here. Varing knew she was
neither. He looked at a row of empty
whiskey bottles on the mantel, and
had the answer. Jack Ivor was still
a weakling, a wastrel, and with him
into the depths he was dragging his
loyal wife and their curly-haired son.
  Varing knew why they hadn’t been
molested here. Russ Kilrain had been
away. But now he was back. A chill
touched Kent Varing; momentarily,
he had forgotten why he was here.
Kilrain’s wolves had killed others
who’d tried to live here.
  Kent Varing thought: Why should
I warn them away? These two, Jack
Ivor and Barbara Wayne, had humili-
ated him, hurt him more than any-
body else in the world. They'd sud-
denly turned a world of brightness
and hope into a place of darkness
and bitterness. Let Russ Kilrain move
them in his own way. .. .
  Billy had lost his shyness. Fie
climbed hesitantly onto Kent Varing's
lap and tugged with pudgy hands at
the ivory handle of one of his six-
shooters. “Are you a sher'ff?” he
asked.
  Varing grinned, said, “Not exact-
ly, Button!” He looked at Barbara,
and knew that she guessed the truth
—that he was an outlaw.
  “Jack should be in soon,” Barbara
said. “He went to town this evening.
I—he’ll be glad to see you. Kent, are
you alone?”
  “No.” After all, he thought, why
should a girl and a curly-haired kid
be made to suffer for Jack Ivor’s sins?
He said, “Barbara, you’ve got to leave
here.”
  “Leave here?” She shook her head.
“We couldn’t do that. We have no
94
2-GUN WESTERN
where else to go. Why should we
leave here?”
  "People have died here in this cab-
in.”
 “But that was several years ago.
Nobody has bothered us.”
  "They might, if you stay. You must
leave, as soon as you can.”
BARBARA shook her head again.
"I know you have a reason for
saying those things, Kent. But we’ve
got to stay here—got to! It's our
only chance, Jack’s only chance. I
know I haven’t fooled you. You know
why we lost everything, why we’re
living here. Jack’s weak. He's always
had too much. I made him come here.
I thought, away from everybody, he
might—do better. In time, he may. It’s
his only chance, our only chance. I
married him, and I’ll stick with him.
I owe him that much."
 Varing fought back the words of
contempt he felt for Jack Ivor that
came to his lips. He said, “If you feel
that way. ..”
 Barbara had quieted. Her eyes
steady, she said, “I owe you some-
thing, Kent Varing. I know how ter-
ribly I hurt you. I want you to know
why I married Jack Ivor, without
even telling you I aimed to do it. It
can do no harm, now. I did it for an
old, old reason. Money—money Jack
Ivor promised to pay off a mortgage
on daddy’s ranch with. Jack wouldn’t
let me explain, or even tell you what
I meant to do.
  “So I married him; but I didn’t get
the money. Daddy lost the ranch, and
it broke his heart. He died soon after.
Then Buck Ivor died, and Jack
seemed to go to pieces.”
 Fresh hate and contempt for Jack
Ivor welled inside Kent Varing. He
got to his feet. He didn’t want to see
Tack Ivor, for fear of what he might
do.
 Barbara had got to her feet and
gone to the window. She said: “Here
comes Jack now.”
 Varing heard hoofbeats outside.
They stopped at the rear of the cab-
in. and footsteps sounded as some-
body entered through a back doorway.
The footsteps came through a back
room, then Jack Ivor stood in the
doorway.
  Again shock over-rode the hate that
smouldered inside Varing. This
wasn’t the old, debonair Jack Ivor
he’d known, the old swaggering, arro-
gant dandy. A stubble of beard cov-
ered Ivor’s gaunt face. His eyes were
bleary. His clothes were dirty, un-
kempt. Jack Ivor had a quart bottle
in his hand, and he swayed a little
as he squinted in the sudden change
from sunlight to shadow.
  Jack Ivor asked, "Barbara, whose
bronc is that outside? And who're
them hombres coyotin’ out behind the
thicket?”
  And Barbara said softly, “Jack,
here's an old friend of yours. Kent
Varing. ..”
  Jack Ivor stiffened, took a back-
ward step. Then his eyes focused on
Varing, and he laughed sneeringly.
“No need to come sneakin’ back now,
Varing. She’s my wife now, remember
that!”
  Barbara flushed, said pleadingly,
“Jack, please! Kent didn’t know we
lived here when he stopped.”
  “Then why is he here?” Ivor asked.
“Anyway, he knows it now. He’s not
wanted here. Is that plain. Varing?”
Kent Varing held himself rigidly
in check. “Plain enough. Your skunk
smell is worse than ever, Ivor. It must
be hell to have to stand it for five
years. Five seconds is too long for
me!”
KENT VARING whirled, strode
from the cabin. He swung into the
saddle, his brown, hawkish features
harsh with anger, and sent the dun at
a gallop up the incline and through
the cedars to where Russ Kilrain and
the others waited.
  “It took you a hell of a long time.”
the burly, red-bearded Kilrain
growled impatiently. “Who’s down
there?”
  "Just a woman and a kid.”
  “I saw a man ride up on a hoss a
minute ago. What about him?”
  Varing shrugged, said. “He don’t
count. Soused to the gills, and yella.
Name of Jack Ivor.”
  “Ivor, huh?” Kilrain grunted. “I've
had dealin’s with him. He’s yella, all
right, and treacherous. He cain’t be
trusted. Rather have most anybody
there than him. Did you tell ’em to
get out?”
HARDCASE OR COWARD?
95
  “No," Varing said tautly. “I fig-
ured—”
  “You're not supposed to do any fig-
urin’,” Kilrain snapped, hard-eyed.
“You’re supposed to do as you’re told.
I’m not so blasted finicky. You gents
wait here a minute!”
  Russ Kilrain whirled his big black,
sent it pounding down the decline.
Kent Varing, watching, saw him fling
from the saddle and stride into the
cabin. He was in the cabin no more
than sixty seconds. Then he came out,
mounted and rode back to his waiting
men. A grin was on Kilrain’s thin,
cruel lips.
  “I gave ’em till midnight to pack
and get out,” he said. “Told ’em I’d
be back then. Well, l^te ride!”
  Kilrain's four henchmen grinned
wolfishly. They were hard men, scum
of the outlaw trails; murder was the
kind of work they enjoyed. Kent Var-
ing said nothing as they rode on
through the notch beyond the cabin
and along the widening valley. He
tried to hide from Kilrain and the
others the turmoil that was in his
mind.
  The sun was sinking into its nest
of blue hills when they arrived at
the hideout—a big log cabin huddled
back under the walls of a niddon can-
yon. Until his depredations had be-
come too bold a couple of years ago,
Kilrain had operated from this head-
quarters, driving stolen cattle south-
ward into Mexico. Their trail to the
Border lay along the canyon-like val-
ley they’d traversed that evening.
  The horses were watered at a lit-
tle stream that trickled along the
canyon, and turned loose in a rude
pole corral. Kent Varing remained
aloof from the others as they pre-
pared a meager meal and wolfed it.
He’d never liked them; only his bit-
terness had driven him to seek their
reckless company.
  “Ivor’s yella, all right,” Kilrain had
said. “But the gal’s got spunk. She
the same as told me to go to blazes.
She said they wouldn’t leave, and that
I	couldn’t make ’em. Well, mebbe I
cain’t. But I shore as hell can plant
’em!”
 "You can’t kill a woman and a
kid,” Varing said softly.
  “Cain’t I?” Russ Kilrain growled.
“If they’re not outa that shack by
midnight, I’ll burn it over their
heads.”
  Varing shrugged, let the subject
drop. Kilrain would carry out his
threat, he knew. Kent Varing thought:
Well, why not? He’d come back for
vengeance against Jack Ivor. But now
there was no savor to the thought.
Jack Ivor’s cattle were gone, and Ivor
himself was a broken, whiskey-soaked
derelict, without courage or hope.
Vengeance against Jack Ivor would
be tasteless now.
AFTER EATING, Kent Varing
went outside. A white moon had
soared into the sky. The hills were
cool and quiet and peaceful. But there
was no peace in Kent Varing’s mind.
He kept seeing the shadows in Bar-
bara’s tired eyes; he kept feeling the
tug of a curly-haired youngster's
pudgy hands.
  Barbara wouldn't leave. She'd said,
‘‘We’ve got to stay here. It’s our only
chance, his only chance...”
  Barbara and the youngster would be
better off with Jack Ivor dead. But
if Ivor died, they’d die too. ..
 Kent Varing roped his dun from
the corral and saddled him. Then he
went back to the cabin. It still lacked
three hours till midnight. Kilrain and
his four followers were seated about
a rude table, dealing blackjack.
  Kent Varing stood just inside the
doorway. He said, “Kilrain, you’ll
have to pull that job tonight without
me. I'm takin’ a little ride. Mebby
I’ll be back, mebby not.”
  Surprise leaped into the eyes of
Kilrain and the others. Then Russ
Kilrain’s reddish eyes went bleak and
wary. “You pettin’ cold feet, Var-
ing?” he asked.
  Varing said softly. "Call it what
you like. I just don’t cotton to mur-
derin' women and kids.”
  “So that’s it?” Kilrain purred. “You
wouldn’t have any ideas about double-
crossin’ us, would you, Varing?”
Varing shrugged, said, “My ideas
are my own business. I’m ridin’ now.
And I'll have a gun lined on this door
till I'm out of sight. Adios!”
 He backed through the doorway
and to his horse. His eyes never left
the lighted doorway as he swung into
96
2-GUN WESTERN
the saddle and spurred through the
jackpines that hemmed the cabin.
  He put the dun into a mile-eating
lope and headed southward. He knew
he was doing a crazy thing. But he
had to get Barbara and the boy out
of that cabin. Jack Ivor had dragged
them down to disgrace and shame.
Ntow, unless they left that cabin,
they’d die.
  Kent Varing knew that Kilrain
would be furious at his desertion, and
suspicious. Maybe he wouldn’t wait
till midnight to start on his murder-
ous mission.
  The moon was high in the sky when
Varing pushed his tired dun through
the canyon mouth and stopped before
Jack Ivor’s cabin. The cabin was dark
and quiet. Hope lifted inside Kent
Varing. Maybe, after all, Kilrain’s
warning had had its effect.
  Then, suddenly, a puppy started
barking excitedly inside the cabin.
Billy would never have gone off with-
out the pup. Kent Varing dismounted,
stepped across the porch and rapped
on the door with his knuckles. For a
moment there was deathly silence.
Even the pup had stopped barking.
  Then Barbara’s voice, calm but de-
fiant, called out, “Get away from that
door, or I’ll rhoot!”
  Varing said, “Barbara, it’s me—
Kent Varing. Open the door!”
  And Jack Ivor’s voice, high-pitched,
fearful. “Don’t open the door—it's a
trick! Varing’s one of Kilrain’s gang.
Don’t open the door!”
  But footsteps sounded, a latch lift-
ed and the door opened. Barbara.
stood revealed in murky light, a gun
in her hand, and Varing saw that the
windows had been blinded. There
wasn’t any fear or distrust on Bar-
bara’s pale face as she stood aside
for Kent Varing to enter. Varing
stepped inside, closed it and stood
with his back to it.
PLAINLY, preparations for a fight
had been made. There was an air
of tension in the room. Barbara was
dressed in denims and shirt. Billy
huddled on a pallet on the floor, eyes
wide and bewildered, his puppy
clutched in his arms. Jack Ivor stood
against the wall, repeating rifle in his
hands. Ivor’s face was ghastly pale
through his stubble of beard. His
hands were shaking, and stark fear
showed in his staring eyes.
  Jack Ivor said shrilly, “Blast you,
Varing, I know what you're up to.
Russ Kilrain sent you. Put up your
hands or I’ll cut you in two!”
  “Please, Jack!” Barbara said sharp-
ly. Then, “What is it, Kent?”
  "All of you must leave here, now,”
Varing said swiftly, ignoring Jack
Ivor. "There’s no time to explain.”
“You don’t need to explain,” Bar-
bara said quietly. “Russ Kilrain, if
that was his name, made everythfTig
pretty plain when he was here this
evening. He told us to leave, or he'd
kill us.”
  Varing said to Jack Ivor, “You fool,
why haven’t you taken her and the boy
away? Kilrain wasn't bluffing. He
may show up any minute.”
  Jack Ivor was plucking nervously at
the buttons on his dirty shirt. His lips
seemed stiff. “I tried to get her to
leave,” he whined. “I told her Kilrain
would kill us all. But she wouldn’t
leave. Maybe she’ll listen to you,
Varing.”
  “I won’t” Barbara declared firmly.
“If we left here we’d have nothing, no
place to go. We’d be out on the prairie,
homeless, with the rain and wind in
our faces. What we have here is piti-
fully little, but it holds all our hopes
for the future. It’s worth fighting for,
worth dying for if we have to!”
  “There are other places, Barbara,”
Jack Ivor said pleadingly. “I—I know
I	haven’t been much of a husband. I’ve
been weak, worthless; I've dragged
you and the boy down with me. But
leave here with me, Barbara, and I
promise you things will be different.
I’ll get a job. I’ll quit whiskey, and all
the other things. I’ll be a man.”
  B a r b a r a’s face was pale and
strained, but she was adamant.
  She said, “If you want to be a man,
you’ll never have a better chance than
to be one right here, tonight!”
  Billy had gotten up from the pallet.
He went to Jack Ivor and looked up
into his fear-distorted face.
“I’m not afraid,” he lisped. “My
daddy won't let anybody hurt me.”
Jack Ivor looked down at th#
youngster, as if just then aware of hi«
existance. His trembling finger*
HARDCASE OR COWARD?
97
touched the curly head. He opened his
lips as if to speak, then closcd them.
  Kent Varing said to Barbara, “Then
you won't leave?"
  She shook her head. “I won't leave.
But you’d better go now, Kent; it may
be too late in a little while."
  Varing shook his own head. An odd
exaltation had lifted inside him. Me
said, “If you stay, Barbara, I stay.
We'll fight."
  There was nothing to do, except
wait. They talked little. Barbara was
quiet-eyed, tense. Billy huddled again
with his puppy in his arms. Jack Ivor
had quieted some; several times he
drank from the quart bottle on the
mantel. But he was still nervous. He
paced the floor, the rifle in his hands.
BARBARA had nailed thick boards
over the windows, leaving cracks
to fire through. They barricaded the
doors. Kent Varing crouched at a win-
dow, where he could watch through a
chink the dim trail that snaked
through the narrow canyon pass three
hundred yards above the cabin.
Through this pass Russ Kilrain and
his gun-wolves would come.
  Kent Varing smiled sardonically in
the dim lamplight. Kent Varing, out-
law, waiting to fight, probably die, for
the very ones who had driven him out
onto the owlhoot! He knew they
wouldn't have much of a chance
against Kilrain's killers. They could
hold them off a while, but there could
be but one ending.
  Barbara and Jack Ivor must have
realized that too. But the girl showed
no signs of fear or regret. She had
nothing to lose, perhaps nothing to
gain. But she meant to fight. Varing
looked at Jack Ivor. Ivor had paused
beside the pallet
  Billy's pudgy fingers were tugging
at the tattered leg of Ivor's levis. He
heard Billy say, “Daddy, you won't let
anybody hurt me. will you?”
  Jack Ivor started, looked down at
the boy. He said hoarsely, “I—don’t
you worry, button. I—I'll take care of
you." Then Ivor went to the mantel,
reached a shaking hand for the bottle.
  Kent Varing turned back to the win-
dow. He didn't feel any contempt for
Jack Ivor’s weakness and cowardice
now. A coyote couldn’t change into
a wolf.
  Jutting against the moonlit sky,
Kent Varing could see dark moun-
tains. The mountains looked friendly
and inviting; the silvery moonlight
gleaming on their crests looked like a
beckoning finger. Beyond those
mountains was safety for Kent Var-
ing: here in this cabin was death.
There was yet time to ride.
  Kent Varing grimaced in the dim
light. Guns in hand, he hunkered
lower beside the window. He knew
that midnight was almost at hand.
Any minute now Russ Kilrain would
come. . .
 He heard Billy ask, “Mummy,
where’s my daddy?"
  Varing turned. Jack Ivor wasn’t in
the room. Now Varing remembered
hearing Ivor in the kitchen a little
while before, moving something about.
Strengthening the barricade, he’d
thought.
  Barbara was looking at Kent Var-
ing, a mute question in her eyes. Var-
ing got to his feet, went into the tiny
back room. Jack Ivor wasn’t there.
The barricade had been pulled aside;
the door was slightly ajar. Jack Ivor
was gone.
  He replaced the barricade, returned
to the front room. He looked into Bar-
bara’s wide, questioning eyes, and
nodded. Barbara bowed her head, and
Varing thought he heard a sob. He
went back to his vigil at the window.
  Billy had crossed to his mother. He
asked, "Where’s my daddy? He said
he’d take care of me.”
 “Daddy’ll—be back in a little
while,” Barbara said. “He’ll take care
of us. You go back and lie down.”
  Harsh anger rioted through Kent
Varing. Jack Ivor was lower even than
he'd thought. To save his own cow-
ardly hide, Ivor had deserted his wife
and child just when they needed him
most. Varing remembered what Bar-
bara had said a little while ago: “If
you want to be a man, you'll never
have a better chance than to be one
right here, tonight!”
 Jack Ivor hadn’t taken that
chance...
2-GUN WESTERN — 15 BIG STORIES!
THEN KENT VARING tried to
forget about Jack Ivor. Ivor’s de-
sertion had cut down their already
slim chances. Barbara realized that
too. Her tanned face was strained and
pale in the dim light. Billy, sensing
at last that something awful was
about to happen, had begun to whim-
per.
  Kent Varing tensed suddenly. Faint,
yet plainly audible on the still night
air, he heard the sound of hoofs. Eyes
glued to the crack in the window, he
stared into the shadowy mouth of the
pass three .hundred yards away. He
could see nothing, yet he knew that
Kilrain’s renegades were coming.
  Then, all at once, the canyon mouth
seemed to explode in a red burst of
fury before Kent Varing's eyes. A
blasting roar of gunfire beat against
his eardrums, and the pass was criss-
crossed with writhing tongues of gun-
flame. In the gunpowder torches he
could see weird, leaping figures.
  Kent Varing leaped to his feet. He
tore the barricade from in front of the
door, hurled his body through the
opening and started running toward
the canyon mouth. The pass was still
a fiery chaos of leaping flame and
boiling gunsmoke, of screaming lead
and yelling, confused men.
  Varing's pumping legs seemed to
carry him at a snail's pace toward the
pass. He was aware that Barbara's
slim, flying figure was beside him; he
could see moonlight gleaming on the
gun in her hand. Side by side, they
leaped into the canyon mouth.
  The gunfire had slackened. Rider-
less horses were pounding along the
canyon. Motionless figures lay on the
ground. Then two mounted figures
loomed before Kent Varing. They’d
seen Varing and the girl in the moon-
light, and their guns started blazing.
Kent Varing heard the waspish hiss of
lead; he felt a fiery sting as a bullet
grazed his thigh.
  Then his own deadly guns started
hammering and flaming. He heard the
blasting roar of Barbara’s .38 beside
him. Fresh sound beat back from the
canyon walls. The shadows churned
with cyclonic gun-fury. In the red
glow, Varing saw one of the mounted
figures suddenly drop his gun and
tumble stiffly to the ground.
  Then, as suddenly as it had begun,
the gunfire subsided. Whipped by the
chill wind, gunsmoke rolled like a fog
up out of the gorge, and the ribbon of
moonlight that penetrated to the floor
of the canyon revealed six dead men.
One of them was Russ Kilrain. Four
others were his henchmen.
  The sixth man was Jack Ivor. Jack
Ivor sat with his back against a wall,
the still-smoking muzzle of his rifle
thrust over a boulder before him. He
didn’t look scared or weak now. As he
died there had been a soft smile on
Jack Ivor's gaunt, bearded face, like
he was thinking of something pleas-
ant.
 Jack Ivor had said, “Don’t you
worry, button. I—I’ll take care of
you!’’ And he had. He’d made it pos-
sible for them all to live.
  Barbara was sobbing softly, and
Kent Varing put his arm about her
slim figure and led her out of the
canyon—toward a future that had been
purged of its bitterness and glowed
bright with promise of happiness. A
future made possible by a man who,
afraid to live, had in the end found
something worth dying for. #END

  Webb was silent, mutely grateful
