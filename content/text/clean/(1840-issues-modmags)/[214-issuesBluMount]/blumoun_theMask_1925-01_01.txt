TEATRO ALIBERTI in Via Margutta. 2. TEATRO ARGENTINA in Strada de' Cesarini. 3. TEATRO TOR DI NONA opposite Castel Sant'Angelo. All three were public Theatres. The Tor di Nona was first built in 1660 but soon destroyed by fire; it was rebuilt in 1671 : destroyed in 1698, and rebuilt in 1735, and this is the plan given above (fig 3). This building was destroyed by fire in 1780, and again built in 1781 ; it fell in ruins in 1785 when it was again rebuilt, and again in 1795; restored in 1830, restored again in 1867, it was finally destroyed in 1882, and in 1886 demolished for ever to make room for a new embankment to the Tevere. Surely few Theatres have been more Phoenix-like. The Teatro Alibert or Aliberti (fig. I), first known as Teatro delle Dame, built in 1718, was burnt at the end of the 19th century. The Teatro Argentina (fig. 2) was built in 1732 and still exists. Illustration 46 THE PRIVATETEATRINO OF CARDINALOTTOBONI in Roma, designed and built by the Architect Juvarra circa 1700-1705.

FOREWORD J. S. IN Nolli's Plan of Roma, which is here offered for thefirst time in a handy form and at a popular price, wehave a leaf of genuine History, for it is all fact.Books about the Roma of the 18th century may con- tain as much fancy as fact, and that in time renders themof little use to the historian. We talk of the Roman streets,of the Palaces, Theatres, Churches and other monuments;we write of the Piazza Navona or the Palazzo Rospigliosi,and though all these may be known by hearsay to us theystill remain vague, ....vague as to position, form, size, andin their relation to their surroundings.We may have seen these places, but perhaps forgottenone of them, and, certainly, quite forgotten where they areplaced, how surrounded, or how one reaches them bomthe Porta del Popolo or bom the Porta di S. GiovanniLaterano.Ask yourself to define the track leading from Portadel Popolo to the Piazza Navona without looking at any plan. It is only a matter of pulling down a few streets....but can you do it?To save you the trouble here is Nolli. He can standon your desk in his present form: in 1 748 he was far toobig a book to be handy: and even if you can get a copynow it is too large to serve you as reference book, for it isa folio of thirty six pages, and measures one foot seveninches by one foot two inches." The Mask " having seen that, besides this plan ofRoma being one of the very best, it was used frequently bythe most active students of the Theatre, thought that, byreducing it to a practical size it would be doing some ser- vice. So now you can have your Nolli's Plan of Romaclose at hand to refer to when rereading the many bookswhich deal with Roma, no matter what the subject. Notonly theatrical students but scholars of all kinds will findit useful.The Plan illustrates many hundreds of books, but italso corrects, and with authority, a number of them, sup- plementing others. Errors have sometimes crept into thesepooks because the chief guide, Roma itself, was notproperly followed.Nolli shows us eight Theatres, most of them veryclearly defined. Teatro Alibert, 296:Teatro Argentina, 771:Teatro Capranica, 332 :Teatro de' Granari, 618 :Teatro della Pace, 611:Teatro della Pallaccorda, 444:Teatro di Tordinona, 536:Teatro della Valle, 795.But we must not forget that this short list of eight thea- tres represents none but the " public playhouses ": and thatin many a palace was a magnificent Teatro privato or a Teatrino. And, lest we develope any wrong notion aboutRoma and its manner of doing things of this kind in theseventeenth and eighteenth Centuries, let us state what aprivate Theatre was not in those days.Merely because it was private, it was not anythingwhich today we call "amateurish but inasmuch as it wasan " amatore delle arti", a lover of the arts, who devoted alarge portion of his wealth and time to the care of hisTeatro, so was the work amateurish, but only in this sense.Devoting time and money to his Teatro did not asa rule mean that he interfered with the work, the con- struction of the place, the production or composition of plays,opera or ballet. Counts Pepoli and Albergatti, two of theforemost amatori d'arte of Italy, did assuredly write plays,and perform in them; but as a rule the great people ofRoma made and kept their private theatres more for theentertainment of their guests and to avoid the inconvenien- ces of the public playhouses with their crush, draughts,noise and suffocation.Amongst those who had Private Theatres in Romawere the Queen of Poland, Maria Casimira, who in 1709lived in Pal azzo de Torres alia Trinita del Monte: OlimpiaAldobrandini, the famous Principessa di Rossano; theSpanish Ambassador whose private theatre in the SpanishPalace was built in 1688: the Barberini family, whosetheatre it is said seated 3000 people and was opened in1634. The Prince Galicano had a private Theatre atwhich Evelyn in 1645 witnessed " a magnificent opera ".Then there was the teatro of Palazzo Rospigliosi; those ofPalazzo Corsini; of Palazzo Colonna in Borgo, (the Co- lonna family had it seems two private theatres, one of theseknown as "il grand teatro del Contestabile Colonna "); ofthe Palazzo Panfili in the Corso; and of the Collegio Ro- mano. The most fashionable theatre of 1639 was a pri- vate Theatre built by Bernini in the Fonderia del Vati- cano. Lastly there was the teatrino built for Cardinal PietroOttoboni by Juvarra in about 1 700, a building of threetiers and most beautifully designed interior. We have seenthe almost unknown original designs. In 1678 during thecarneval there were 130 comedies given in the privatetheatres of Roma.But most of our readers probably know all aboutthese places and what was performed there, and the Planis onlv to serve as a means of locating their exact positions. A NEW PLAN OF ROMA PUBLISHED IN THE YEAR MDCCXLVIII. BY GIOVAN BATTISTA NOLLI. FOREWORD BY THE DESIGNER. (i) ALTHOUGH the leaves of the large Planof Roma ought to be all unitedtogether, so as to have them all extendedbefore the eye, as are usually all Geo- graphical Maps, yet, if it should pleaseanyone to have them bound, in book form,it is to be noted that, to be able to makeuse of its indexes, desiring to find thoseBuildings or Places which are in the samePlan, it is necessary first to find in thealphabetical Index the name of that Buil- ding or Place which one is seeking, andio see what is the number by which itts indicated on the sheets ; then the same number is found in the other numericalIndex, and in this wise one will know inwhich Rione it is described : and, seeingin that same Rione the number alreadyfound, one will see the Place or Buildingdesired. At the top of each sheet arerepeated the Rione, and, some being de- scribed in a single sheet, others in severalsheets, there is indicated, beside the nameof each one, those sheets in which somepart of this same Rione is included, andin one of which there will be found thenumber of the Building, or Place, whichone seeks.

THE PRIVATE TEATRINOOF THE COLLEGIO ROMANOIN ROMA J. S. MECHANISM INSTALLED IN THE TEATRINOOF THE COLLEGIO ROMANO IN ROMA. THE THREE LARGE ROMAN THEATRES OF THE 18th CENTURY.1. TEATRO ALIBERTI in Via Margutta. 2. TEATRO ARGENTINA in Strada de' Cesarini. 3. TEATROTOR DI NONA opposite Castel Sant'Angelo.All three were public Theatres. The Tor di Nona was first built in 1660 but soon destroyed by fire; it wasrebuilt in 1671 : destroyed in 1698, and rebuilt in 1735, and this is the plan given above (fig 3). This building was destroyed by fire in 1780, and again built in 1781 ; it fell in ruins in 1785 when it was again rebuilt,and again in 1795; restored in 1830, restored again in 1867, it was finally destroyed in 1882, and in 1886 demolished for ever to make room for a new embankment to the Tevere. Surely few Theatres have been morePhoenix-like. The Teatro Alibert or Aliberti (fig. I), first known as Teatro delle Dame, built in 1718, wasburnt at the end of the 19th century. The Teatro Argentina (fig. 2) was built in 1732 and still exists. THE PRIVATETEATRINO OF CARDINALOTTOBONIin Roma, designed and built by the Architect Juvarra circa1700-1705.

I have selected these two and six other plans and* designs of stages and stage scenes because theyillustrate a point in the development of the Theatrein Roma in the 18th century,I have not seen them reproduced in any bookor journal since they were first printed in thatcentury. Every day it is the very celebratedLa Scala * at Milano, or the equally celebrated44 San Carlo *' in Napoli which we see reproducedfor us, until surely the world is in danger ofgrowing tired of them. ' I 'HE date when the theatre was put up in theA Collegio Romano is unknown to me : whetherthere was one only or the place had more is alsounknown to me.Colleges in Italy were not slow to providegood stages for the students and their study ofdeportment and speech. In Parma in the firsthalf of the 17th century we find in the Collegiodei Nobili such a theatre. This College continuedto improve its theatre, and about 1652 had mo- veable scenes of the triangular kind of which Sab- battini had written in 1637 ; and by about 1750had two Theatres, one large and one small.The point I wish to make, is, that documentsexist which show us very complete Italian CollegeTheatres, and that they are not merely temporarystages. THE PRETTYTHEATRE PART TWO AS I said in my opening notes on thistheme, I do not intend to be critical. Mypurpose is more that of the print-collectorthan of the writer.Have you not seen this print-collector insome old shop, in Rue de la Seine or Ruedes Beaux Arts, as he sits by the hourturning over hundreds of prints of all subjectsaftd of all centuries.... silent.... pausing tolook at some, turning over others without morethan a glance, picking out with deliberation,but without a word said, one here, onethere ; laying them in a heap. Then, after agood three hours' search, silently paying forthese, ....going home.... undoing his package....going more slowly over each print.... sayingnothing.My purpose is his : he thinks a devil ofa lot, may be ; but whatever he thinks it ishis delight in the print as a print, includingsubject, condition of the print, name of en- graver, date, quality of the work and price.And so is it here v/ith me. If some arecensorious, when they hear of Mile. Guimard,Sophie' Arnould and Madame Montansier, toselect three of the most remarkable namesfrom a big bouquet, .... if some find the privatetheatres of the first two ladies mere hot-bedsof vice and the many public theatres ruledover by the third dens of infamy, I have cometo look on them as the old print collector looksupon his treasures. They have cost me verylittle, and have given me great pleasure:I have read so much about them, seen thehouses they made and seen them recorded again;I have seen them die : even come to forgetthem in the centuries which followed: remem- bered them again while contemplating subse- quent centuries : see them again now. I forone cannot pick one of them out for censure.But I muse at times: La Guimard isworth the threepence 1 gave for her: Sophieat a golden guinea was not dear: MadameMontansier .... 1 would any day give againthe shilling I was asked for her and withouta murmur.If the price is sometimes low, what of that: I gave what the print-seller asked. For a songby Mozart there is no price, ....so rare thatfew can hear it, so cheap that anyone mayhave it: for a glance at the Palazzo Ducalein Genova nothing is asked ; you may evenpass it for nothing and not see it. So thatit seems that the price of a thing is nothingby which to guage the value : nothing fornothing and dam little for sixpence " soundspretty so far as it goes, but the sound is itsprincipal asset. There is not truth there.You sometimes can get all for nothing andsometimes for a thousand pounds nothing.€f The pretty is often held to be so cheapthat it is not worth any notice at all; andassuredly a little of it can be afforded by anyof us and is useful tp all. It is useless todeny that. Whether in certain centuries itwas worth quite so much as the price put onit is another matter. I cannot tell; ....I leaveit to the Due d'Orleans and the Prince d'Heninto settle that between them.... if they evermeet nowadays.The pretty, spite of it being so cheap,possibly cost the Theatre of Europe and itsDrama a pretty penny. What of that ? ....are we not here today to pay the mortgage ?I have the utmost sympathy with thosewho feel they are too poor to do more thanadd to this debt, for the next century will haveto pay. Possibly that is one of the reasonswhy so many well-to do actors nowadays warntheir sons against taking up the profession.But let us return to my print shop.The last time I was in Zenabella Idiscovered a book in my print shop. It wasa hovel of a place, and there lay Zola's" Nana ". I bought it; I took it home andI read it. NANA X. Y. Z. a—aßflH-yyagff.jp—a—in I I ma—a— P I ■ I wan—BMMW &lt; b ■■l'—maw——a—^" All Paris will visit your Theatre ". " Say,my brothel, answered tI suppose that there are very few peopleliving today who are reading Emile Zola'snovel " Nana " for the first time : yet 1 havebut just finished reading it and .for the firsttime, although I began it some thirty yearsago and came to a full stop at the passagein Chapter One where a manager of a Theatreasks a habituee of his playhouse to drop the word " theatre " and substitute the word"brothel" 0).Knowing dozens of theatres which wereserious places, (serious as churches, banks, orships) I drew the line at any further interestfor a book, whose author, I saw, promised tokeep up the fantastic old delusion of the out- sider.That the theatre this Zola was to writeof, was no theatre at all, settled it for me thatI should not be interested. I put the bookdown.* * *€f That I was probably prejudiced onlyoccurs to me now. For have not there beenwriters who made novels out of Banks full ofThieves, Churches full of Knaves ? Theworld is full of men and women, and men andwomen full of pranks, passions, vices andvirtues.Are we to read only about virtues andthe virtuous? They exist and are often hidden,and so to reveal them with what we call" art" is to do a trick not without beauty.But no virtue is quite valuable surrounded bya sea of virtues ; how mark a poor single virtue,how illumine it, if no vices are there to setoff its brilliance ? Too much virtue may beas vile as too much vice. €J So three days ago when I was in needof a book to read .... a novel above all else....I happened to pick up a copy of " Nana "on a bookstall. For three francs I bought it,and in three days I have read it.And it is awefu 11.It deals with the life of a woman whogoes on to the stage without any qualifications,without genius cr talent, unable to act, butpossessed of an astounding personality.... ofthe personality which attracts.... of animalmagnetism. This personality is not the personality ofa Rachel, who also attracted besides havinga genius as a tragic actress ; it is not a bril- liant personality, it is just a weak one ; sheis amiable, a hundred times amiable, loveable,and all over the place.By means of this personality displayed onthe stage she brings all Paris to her feet.She lives every kind of life in poor quar- ters, in gaudy well-to-do ones, in neat ones,in sumptuous ones, and finally dies of thesmallpox, her face eaten away.To the end, and even beyond it, shestill continues to attract.This is not repulsive although it does notsound exactly attractive. But there is an un- der current which is interesting, more attrac- tive, stranger, for those of us who work inTheatres and want to see the Theatre of theworld taking on a new lease of life. It is atheme which recurs and recurs, and eachtime it does so it reminds us of paragraphswe read today in the newspapers, or of photo- graphs we have seen only yesterday in theshop windows. It is the theme of the Impre- sario and the hangers-on to Theatres letit be instantly added the tenth-rate ones, theseflashy gentlemen with their big press agenciesand their paragraphed expressions of heartfeltdesire to uplift the drama, even to make itsacred, ....even if they have to sweeten thepill for the public by serving up the moralwith something that tastes good; in short, themost beautiful women that can be found inEurope and America.We hear of these funny fellows every day.In " Nana " we have their portraits. II. WHEN some suave theatrical impresario ordirector wrote to Nana was she atthat time in Berlin or Prague?... saying hewanted to see her really a success, that itwas his way to work for love, ....could notdream of business where she was concerned,....that her immense talents were being hid- den, that he felt it was part of his life's workto bring her to Paris (or was it New York?),she naturally ran off to Paris or New Yorkas quickly as possible. Yes, it was to Parisshe ran. And became a great success ; hadsome twenty lovers immediately, ....yes, in- stantly.... ; took up with a twenty-first, a man of wealth and left the twenty for a month ;then after a few weeks more took the twentyback with the twenty first. Then threw themall over; disappeared with a hideous lookingactor ; stayed with him a few months in moreor less poverty in Montmartre ; then sank toworse poverty and haunted the cafe of someold woman who was always eager to see newfaces ; appeared on the stage for two nights,and in those two nights managed to win ano- ther protector, who lavished on her millionsof francs ; ....all this was quite natural. Theimpresario and the manager, looking holy,were photographed with the lady between them;all Paris was impressed, .... just like today.And our 1924 Theatre is where it wasin 1870: it is where these impresarios andmanagers, with their clever manipulation ofwomen, would have it.It is devilish clever to be sure. Theworld gets bitten by a longing to see a sa- cred play having heard that the Oberam- mergau Passion Play is rot to be seen unlessthe world will travel all the way to Oberam- mergau, and then only once in every tenyears. So the impresario and the managerresolve to make up a substitute to console afretful world. It shall have its sacred play,.... but it wont really be so sacred as allthat, because we are prudent gentlemen fromthe East, and know that the Western world(which, by the way, we despise) only wantsto have the shadow of sacred things ; if theremust be any substance let it be as fleshy aspossible.And Nana is again caught in the net....and landed ever so gently; put on the mar- ket ; praised by the modern press agent monthby month for her dramatic virtues, then eachweek, then each day; cables are sent roundthe world of her amazing talents (and shewith but one, and that the old magnetismpossessed by myriads of women) ; photographsfill the back pages of daily papers ; and arich man, also from the East, is found to actnobly by supporting the immense expense,....so great is his love for art ....and religion,especially the Christian religion. In short thewhole thing almost causes the impresario tobreak down with emotion so noble he is, sheis, they all are.Every day and in every land this is beingdone in Theatres, on a small scale and on alarge scale. If not a " religious " play it's a Revue,or a Historical play; any old theme serves,.... it's the woman is the goods.Do you want any examples pointed outto you ? There's no need, they are so evident.The small town of Zenabella, in which, Iwrite this, has given me the details which Ihave here related.Perhaps in New York or in Paris or inLondon today there are no ludicrous jokes ofthis sacred art business being perpetrated.I leave you to decide that.But here in Zenabella a dark-skinnedfellow of the name of Moses Bethany cameand bamboozled the entire province (and thetown itself) with his productions of a thinghe called " A Miraculous Play ", in whichthere was nothing sacred at all. But how hefooled them ! ! !So do read " Nana it tells you howit is done so much better than I can.€fl A strange and sad point made byZola is the amazing infidelity of his Heroine :he is always returning and returning to this.Of her amours I do not speak; 1 refer to theinfidelity of her mind. And she and mostof her fellow-actresses are adepts at abusingeveryone with their tongues. Yet MadameBerton's pretty book had not then appea- red (').There is hardly one, favoured or not fa- voured, whom these ladies do not abuse likepickpockets. It is a curious point; ....is it trueto life ?Have actresses such utterly unfaithful minds,so little control over their tongues? Do theyreally slander to the extent Zola makes out ?If so, is it due to the constant changing oftheir very nature each night, due to their pro- fession which forces them to this capaciousversatility ? Is it due to this profession thatthey come to behave like nothing real, andsee all real life and living beings as false lifeand false beings,as they open a door on thestage and go on into an unreal existence ? Ithink it is; and so possibly they may beexempt from the blame due to others, for theyhave no sense left of realities.If this be true, then, if they lied theywould lie like truth, making " the very truthseem falsehood to it": this goes without saying.One is not an actress, I suppose, for nothing. And yet so many of these great ladies in theParis story are dancers, singers, chorus-girls ;all blended together, as in life, I suppose;journalists, singers, bankers, painters and girls ;an odd crew.... and all so real.One wonders, is the whole book a libel,or is it true ?... or is it mezzo e mezzo. III. NOW it begins to look as though these fewnotes on the Pretty Theatre were soonto deveiope into the Ugly Theatre.But 'tis no such thing. The prettiness isthere, and under it what is under all else.We shall soon come to pretty Mile. Gui- mard, her mother, Mr Leger and the Mar- quis de Soubise. And Fragonard will stepinto the room . ..or rather into that little pri- vate Theatre of hers ; and Fragonard is aguarantee for the perfection of prettiness.A few measurements of her theatre, afew dates as to when the place was putup .. .and put up for auction.... cannot de- tract greatly from the charm; dates are inany case valuable as a basis for Terpsicoreto pirouette 0n.... and even to die 0n,... for- gotten.Poor Terpsichore, one of " le ballerine "who dominated not only the realms of thestage but also those of "la Galanterie To be continued• (1) Even today I wince for the Theatre when Zolais so appalling rude about it. Yet Ido not find him old- fashioned although it is the fashion to call him that. Thething which makes him seem so to people of today is thatthey have not read him. If Congieve be up-to-date it isbecause they do read him. Zola is now successfullydisposed of after a struggle, and because he added griefand pain to his tale he is to be shelved. Had he spangledand powdered his heroine at her death and let her laugha little more ironically, she and* he today would be a lamode. (I) Vide Mask, Vol, X. Page 135. IMITATION.A NOTE BY JAN KLAASSENWITH STORY BY A. DUMAS PERE. IMITATING to perfection is certainly a talent,and it is this special talent which is pos- sessed by the Russians. They derive it fromthe far East.And in the Russian Theatre this talent hasbeen so cleverly employed that it has tho- roughly dazzled Europeans and Americans.With the Russians imitation really be- comes almost masterly. In defence of this it is often with justiceadvanced that Russians are not the only imi- tators : that even Italy was glad to derive fromthe East, and that her Architecture, Painting,house decoration and all is directly inspiredby the East. Nay, more, Eastern artists cameto Italy at a moment when the arts were in asad plight, and helped the Italians to recoverthemselves.But that is quite another matter, and the artof the Italian architects, sculptors, and painters,though derived from Greece or Byzantiumin the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, (0 is arather greater feat than the making of a wigwhich, when worn, is to be taken for growinghair.To derive from another nation is not toimitate slavishly. The Italians have derived,but have not the requisite nature or knack forimitating. The Russians assuredly have boththis nature and the knack.Russia's far-famed Ballet is the fruit ofthis slick talent, and the other forms of Dra- matic art are thought out and executed by menwho possess immense powers of mimicry.By this I do not mean that they take ideasfrom Antoine or from Reinhardt: I mean thatthey take a drama to pieces, find models ofeach piece in life, and then with astoundingpatience, make facsimiles so that you can hardlytell the difference from the originals.Personally I find this very attractive, justas I found the Queen's Dolls' House attractive.It seemed to me to be a real Palace in mi- niature.... all was there.... only a small Pri- vate Theatre was lacking. I admit that mimicry may possibly haveno relation whatever with art: anyhow it in- trigues me.As an illustration of this colossal power ofmimicry I think the following tale by AlexandreDumas pere will please. Dumas visits a private Collection in a smalltown of Southern France belonging toM. Grasset: " I confess that I expected to see one ofthose poor collections to be met with in pro- vincial towns, with three or four stuffed fishhanging from the ceiling; but I was agreablysurprised to find in the very first room somemagnificent vases by Bernard de Palissy, anda complete collection of stones and mineralsfrom Mount Sinai,—a collection which, pro- bably, could not be found in the Paris Mu- seum of Natural History. Unfortunately I wasnot sufficiently learned in minerology to appre- ciate it properly: I accordingly turned to aquantity of objects of the middle ages, andabove all to some locks and keys, whichwere carved with a taste and skill that wouldhave done honour to Benvenuto Cellini.In this manner we passed successivelythrough four or five rooms, filled with cu- rious objects, the majority of which had beenprocured for M. Grasset by one of his friends,a learned and brave sea-captain, who hadsailed round the world I don't know howmany times, and who had arrived back fromChina about a fortnight or three weeks pre- viously, bringing with him a most singularexample, not of the intellect, but of the pa- tience, of the worshippers of the Great Dragon.Amongst the different pairs of trouserswhich the captain had had made for him be- fore leaving Paris there was one which wasconsidered a master-piece: it was one of thosemiracles which sometimes issue from the esta- blishments of Vaudeau or Poole, and whichenvelop the boots, indicate the calf, abolishthe knee, mark the thigh, and deny the exis- tence of corporation. Accordingly, thanks tothe predilection entertained for them by theirowner, the trousers, after having flourishedalong the coast, at the Cape of Good Hopeand the Isle of France, arrived at Canton,nearly worn out. Nevertheless, owing to thatfashionable cut of which nothing, not even thefact of being new, can supply the place, they i7 i .still looked very well, when the sailor, whoserved as the captain's valet, spilled half theoil contained in a lamp which he was clea- ning, on the very middle of the thigh of theunfortunate pair.This blow, in spite of his philosophy, hadsuch an effect upon the captain, that he hadnot quite recovered from it when one of hisCanton associates came as usual to smoke apipe of opium with him. He found him insuch a state of vexation that he feared somegreat misfortune must have befallen him, andaccordingly enquired what had occurred toalter his habitual good humour. The captainshowed him the unfortunate trousers, which hehad now thrown aside: " There ! " saidhe, " just look! The very pair you were com- plimenting me on yesterday ! ".The friend took the trousers, and turnedthem about with the most provoking calm.When he was quite convinced that they couldftot be worn again, he observed : " Well, you must have another pair made "." Another pair made! " retorted the ca- ptain, " And who's to make another pair,.... some of your Chinese fellows ? "." Certainly, some of my Chinese fellows!"returned the friend with imperturbable coolness." Yes, and get a sack sent to me, madein their regular style! " continued the captain,shrugging his shoulders." They won't make you a sack ", said theother," and, if you only supply them the modelupon which you want them made, they willturn you out a pair of trousers that Vaudeauwouldn't know from his own "." Really ? ", said the captain." Upon my honour ", assured the friend." Well, I have heard hundreds of times ofthe fidelity of the Chinese in imitation "." And what you have heard upon, thesubject has been less than the truth "." By heaven, you make me anxious to trythem" Do try, especially as it won't cost youmuch. How much did you pay for thosetrousers ? "." Fifty-five or sixty francs, I don't quiteremember "." Well, you can see what they're capableof doing here for fifteen "." And what tailor must I take them to ?" The first you come to. Mine if you like,he lives at the gate ". The captain takes his trousers under his arm,follows his friend, and arrives "at the tailor's." Now ", said the friend, " explain whatyou want, and I will translate your wordsto him ".The captain did not need to be told twice,and, spreading out the trousers, he pointedout their cut, and ended by saying that hewanted a pair exactly like them. The friendtranslated the order, and laid great stress onthe directions."Very well", said the tailor, " in threedays the gentleman shall have what he wants"." What does he say ? " asked the captainimpatiently."He says you shall have them in threedays "." Thi ee days ! That's a long time ", saysthe captain.The friend translated the captain's remaikto the Chinese, who looked at the trousersagain, shook his head, and said a few wordsin reply to the interpreter." Well ? " asked the captain." He says there's a great deal of workto do and that three days are not too longin order to have it dene properly "." Well, three days then: but don't let himbreak his word ".And the two friends went away, repeatingtheir directions to the craftsman for the last time.Three days afterwards, as the captain andhis friend were smoking their pipe of opium,the servant opened the door, and announcedtl'l6 toiler"Oh ho", said the captain; "Well, letus see if he is as skilful as he is punctual"." There they are " said the tailor." Let's try them ", said the captain as betook the trousers from the hands of the tailor,put them on, and, in order to be certain thatthey fitted well, told the tailor to draw up theblinds." Why, they fit wonderfully", said, thefriend." I should think so " said the captain:" he has given me my old pair. But whereare the others, you stupid ? " he exclaimed tothe Chinese.The friend translated the remark to thetailor, who gave the other pair with a trium- phant look.The captain changed the trousers." Well, I must be mad " said he. " This pair now seems to be mine. Where can thenew ones be?".The friend expressed the captain's doubtsto the tailor, who held out the trousers uponwhich he had just finished working."Well,here is the new pair" said the friend." No, can't you see they are the oldones ? " replied the captain. " Why hang it,there's the spot of grease ! "." And there's one on the pair you haveon as well! "." What fool's wit can this be ? "" The friend turned to the Chinese, que- stioned him, and, upon hearing his reply,burst into a shout of laughter "." Well ? " said the captain." Well ", said the friend, " What did youorder from this good man " ?" I ordered a pair of trousers "." Like your own "." Yes, like my own "." Well, he has made them so like thatyou can't tell the. difference that's all. Buthe tells me that his greatest trouble has beento wear them cut, and spot them in exactlythe same places ; and that he must charge youfive francs extra, because he failed with twopairs before coming to a satisfactory result;now, however, he defies you to distinguishone pair from the other. You must allowthat that's well worth twenty francs "." Indeed it is ", replied the captain, ashe drew a Napoleon from his pocket and gaveit to the Chinese.The Chinese thanked him, and asked forthe Captain's custom so long as he remainedin Canton, although, he added, if he alwayshad such difficult work given him, there wouldbe no profit on it.From that day the captain could never tellone pair of trousers from the other, so muchalike were they. He brought them both backto France as specimens of Chinese industry,and had promised to make a present of themto M- Grasset. If he kept his word, theymust be far from being the least interestingthings in the collection.* * *P.MOSCOW and Leningrad are midway onthe road from Paris to China. Thetrousers may be Parisian, but the trick isOriental ; and the net result, as someone hasremarked, the synthetic Orient Express. (/) Those interested in this subject can trace it out ininnumerable works on Italian art. The following are a fewlines taken here and there from the " Renaissance in Italy(Fine Arts) " by f. A. Symonds, referring to the Oriental andGrceco-Roman influences felt by the early masters of archi- tecture, painting and sculpture, such as Cimabue, Niccola Pi- sano, and other thirteenth century artists.4 * The Tuscans never forgot the domes of their remoteancestors; the Romans adhered closely to Latin traditions;the Southerners were affected by Byzantine and Saracenicmodelsu The intercourse of Venice with Alexandria determinedthe unique architecture of S. Mark's. The Arabs and Nor- mans left ineffaceable traces of their sojourn on Palermo.....All along the coasts zve here and there find evidences ofOriental style imported into mediaeval 1ta1y....il Existing thus in the midst of many potent influences, andsurrounded by the ruins of past civilisation, the Italians re- combined and mingled styles of marked variety. The Roman,Byzantine, Saracenic, Lombard, and German traditions wereblended in their architecture, as the presiding genius of eachplace deterpiined.44 In the Campo Santo at Pisa may still be seen as arc ho- phagus representing the story of Hip poly tus and Phcedra....Studying the heroic nudities and noble attitudes of this bas- relief, Niccola (Pisano) rediscovered the right way of art—not by merely copying his model, but by divining the secret ofthe grand style. "THE SACKBUT" ANDTHE NEED FOR MUSIC. BY GORDON CRAIG. WHENEVER I see 44 The Sackbut that MusicalReview with a gay cover which appears every month,and costs but one shilling, and is altogether quite an achieve- ment, I am always delighted. The production is due to theenergy of Miss Ursula Greville, her managing EJitor,and her Committee, which includes, amongst others, P. G.Konody and Granville Bantock.It contains excellent historical articles on Lully, Rossini,John Braham, and other articles by modern writers, ....byKalisch and Gatti on Strauss and Malipiero, it is a mostreadable shillings worth, and its publishers are J. Curwen andSons Ltd.I would suggest that the need for music is positive, andthat if something can be done to bring it to us rather moreoften something should be done.I am today well fitted to say a word for the first timeabout the need for music, for, though I am only an artist,and ignorant of the history of music, and quite unawarewho really is who in the modern stream, I am one whoonce made a daily use of music; I mean I fed on it.And when I can no longer hear it I fear to grow thinat heart; and if it does not come to me I cannot hear it;....and so I starve, for seldom does it come.But I have been hearing it for the last six days. I hearit from four in the afternoon until long past midnight. Andthen I hear it once more in the morning from ten to eleven.Will you know where I am and what it is I hear?I am in a big town in the north of Italy, having comehere to see and study an old and celebrated Theatre.I lodge in a top-but-one-floor room of a hotel whichlooks on to a very untidy courtyard ; and the courtyard isfull of hangings and cries and thuds and knockings. Thefar-off hum of wheels and motor horns is soothing to myear, which finds the slamming of shutters, the beating ofcarpets, the howls of servants, ringing of big electric bells,and crackling of cutlery and china, something to meet withfortitude.So much for the noise.But, as I said, this noise gives way to music at fouro'clock, No noise could stand up against such music. I ratherlike it ; it has the common touch which Mr. Kipling tellsus we should try never to lose. Ido not believe I shalllose it; but, spite of Mr. Kipling, to say truly I sometimeswish I could. And my wish is in a measure granted, forI lose it in the morning as I will tell you later.This music, from four o'clock to past midnight, whichsweeps the courtyard of all its hideous noises, breaks threa- teningly outside my window in a great splash, and I feelin danger. I mean it quite seriously but without offence ;I am threatened by the breakers of modern Jazz music.To this Jazz, millions of people dance each afternoon andevery night when bored by the dull old fashioned tinkleat the Cinema. (It is, I hear, now acknowledged that folkonly go to a cinema for the sake of the music).The first time it attacked me I stood and listened to itwith attention for full ten minutes. Perhaps this show ofrespect for it appeased and propitiated its far-off god andwon for me the favour of its own African particular; forwhen I sat down to listen to it without impatience for thenext thirty minutes I found it bearable. I concluded that I could stay Without doubt where 1 was;need not move to another hotel as for a moment I hadfelt I should have to do ; and that I could do my work,which, whatever it be, I always enjoy doing, and in moreor less any reasonable surroundings.So I tried to work. I got on quite well; though Iadmit I was feeling quite ill.For eight, days I felt quite ill every time I heard thatmusic, but now 1 hive grown to rather like it. At firstI believed that I was out of touch with it, because I wasnot down there and in it; and dancing hellishly in the flameswith some deadly serious modern lady who is not such afool as to ask why she does anything but just does it.Well, I don't always like to be outdone by the great,so every afternoon from four to eight and from ten totwelve I will work on through this steaming noise, (which1 am beginning to like) this landing-stage chatter, and askno questions.But its morning now, and up abovj me a player, Ithink a careful lady-player, has just ended an hour'spractice. She has the uncommon touch. Of all tunes tohear coming down to me from on high, one of Chopin'sslighter and loveliest things was the most unexpected. ..and the sun seemed to break through the ceiling.I have heard this piece of music some hundred timesbut not since 1907 have I chanced to hear it.That is a long time to be without something on whichone feeds, and I mention it because it is a serious matter,this starving of the heart.I cannot engage a private orchestra, and I cannot goout to hear music. Very often there is none to go outto hear. I have to work, and regularly. I daresay I couldwork less regularly.So as I cannot hear music in my home by the sea, nearGenova, or go out to hear it, perhaps I ought to stay in thistop-but-one floor room for the rest of my life since I haveagain found music, ....and ask no questions as to its quality.I ought to embrace the full ignorance of the shatteringstrains and move to its blood and thunder rhythm whichis not without decision; allow my new work to be colou- red by its blood and strengthened by its thundering, itsclanging and tumbling form; for there seems a chance thatin the morning the dear lady upstairs may be practising herbit over and over again. These seventeen years I have beenmore or less without all music, and that is, I submit, tobe without a very needful thing.If when I am at home a man with a dancing bearchances to comes down the road I go 'to the window andwatch and listen ; or if an organ passes and, playing as itpasses, passes away, I go on with my work thoroughlydisturbed, but thoroughly ....and well disturbed as I followit to the last far off note. All that was difficult becomesas easy as laughing then; all that was problematical issolved. Wasn't that music; and isn't that where musicis so magical. And mustn't music come and go like that,.. .sometimes lingering a while longer, causing us to throwdown the spade or the pen, to stop measuring, and to standstill and silent in our room or our field ?Is not that music ?If it be, when may we expect to be favoured with alittle ?Is Music perhaps a national thing ?... if so, then ofcourse each nation will see that it is put in its right place....that it waits its turn. First the tram service, next the matterof drainage, and then that bothersome music.But if music is not a National thing, if it is so good,so easy, so harmless that individuals can deal with it, let them. I mean bring it alive again, and bring it in the rightway and the easiest way to everyone who needs it.How ?There must be ten thousand ways besides the" Merrie England " way. 1 suggest that the ordinary waymight be discovered.The organs and the bears and the traffic meantimeremain to cheer us, three or four times a year; until, withhearts once more whole again, musicians c6me pouring backto our cities, and wre hear many dozens of old tunesagain—as I hear one of mine now on the floor above me.The positive need for music has not, I think, just yetbeen made clear to those people who have the control ofmost things in the world, and who, by a little thought,could bring music again into our daily existence.Th ere is Mr. Otto Kahn ; there was Sir Ernest Speyer;they both gave large sums of money I am told to securemusic a hearing in London and New York. There wasthe Comtesse Greffuhle in Paris ; there is Contessa Picco- lomini in Roma. These lovers of music have done a little—all they could do—and yet music dees not reach meor you or our neighbours.There is Lord Berners ; there is Vaughan Williams andGoossens, and there is Martin Shaw in London. Shaw isassuredly trying to get music to these who need it; andpossibly others are doing something. But as well attemptto send coals from Newcastle in a handbag as leave thedistribution of music to the unaided efforts or the men whoare making it.It's a life's wrork to create any little tune anyhow;and then to spread it far and wide, that takes a whole life;and Kahn, Speyer, Morgan and Ford cannot give up theirbanking and motor businesses to devote their fuil time andstrength to the spreading of music far and wide.If they could, it is just such energies who could dothis task ; ....no lesser effort by lesser men can do it.It's folly to fail about music, and failure has beenachieved if we are only to get it by going to a theatre forit—or to a concert. hMusic means health ; it means light; it means all whicra world today unable to afford most things cries out fotoday and is refused.I am no prophet, but, had I a prophesying gift, I thinkI would risk a safe word about music.- I would say that if you can bring music into the streetsinto courtyards, into museums, into railway stations, into'every place where crowds go and pass from, you can againand again rout scepticism, drunkenness and ill health. Youcan get a long way towards solving half your troublesomemodern problems.But you must do it cunningly, with great art.I will give you two examples, one bad, one good.Music was introduced into a Museum one or two yearsago. I think it was in London at one of the SouthKensington Museums.How was it introduced into this place of wanderingpassages and courtyards gemmed with delicious things tolook at and to study, before which hundreds pass along daily,looking at them, and hundreds of others sit studying them ?This is what happened. A closed room was put asidefor the music. Caspifa ! a closed room for this fairy, forthis thing born with wings which are even now not crushed.Anyone in the museum who happened to find out thatmusic could be heard there could go away from the silvercaskets, leave the golden frames and the tapestries andhear a concert!Incredible to me is such an innocence of the true natureof music. Is anything more unpractical, when a world is sick forlack of a little first-aid, than the notice " First aid can beobtained by applying for a ticket (Price one shilling) andby going in search of the aid".First aid has to be brought to the sick for the sickcannot even crawl to where it sits, if it squats in state forthe sake o an exaggerated good form.My second example illustrates this.Outside and below my house by the sea winds a longuphill road. One day last year three men came along thisroad. They were Russians or Poles or some kind offoreigners, and they carried an instrument apiece. Theyseemed to be artists—painters may be—and, walking fromtown to town, they were going towards Roma.As they came along they were playing a strange songof the north. I stopped in my work to listen ; and liste- ning,. I put down my pencil and rcse up quickly andran to call the others. " Did you hear the music? " " Yes,isn't it lovely ".It was indeed very lovely. Nothing wonderful likeStrauss or Debussy perhaps; nor like Beethoven ; but inthe open air and coming towards us, these strange wildnotes sounded perfectly lovely and there an end to ar- gument.I ran out into the garden and leaned over the wail;—they had passed, and, getting fifty paces away, had cometo the end of their delicious piece. And they stopped. Theydid not talk or laugh.They were a little weary with their walking I daresay; and besides this, a man full of wine was coming fromthe direction in which they were going, gesticulating andlurching and making these bursting blatant noises whichcome from the drinkers who are less gay than gloomy.He was addressing the heavens, and called on them towitness to the misery that mankind and the governmenthad brought him to.And then this happened. The three young men withthe music, who had sat down by the roadside, stood upand went towards him surrounding him on three sides,hemming him in like three of Robin Hood's outlaws wouldonce have hemmed in some rich farmer. And before youcould count nine they had begun to play music. Theyplayed it around him, all over him and into him ; and,will you believe me, he stopped dead still, uttered never asound, stood steady and with head depressed and turnedon one side listening.They played on for over five minutes. Then withouta word they passed on towards Roma. The drunkardpassed my house leaving them : not a sound, not a stagger,no lurching. K ■The days of miracles are past I know, but the day ofmusic v/il! never pass.We stand in great need of music today. Js there noone who will bring it to us ? PALAZZO BARBERINI.In which was the Theatre built by Bernini. Plate 3. A NOTE UPON"THE MASK". BY LENNOX ROBINSON.REPRINTED FROMTHE OBSERVER, LONDON. BELIEVING that many friends of 44 The Mask " andof the New Movement in the Theatre will be interestedin the following extract from an article by Mr LennoxRobinson published in " The Observer London, onOctober 12th last, we reprint it, for those who may nothave seen it, by permission of the Editor of TheObserver Mr J. L. Garvin.- THE BEST THEATRICAL MAGAZINEo IN THE WORLD oIT may seem an extraordinary thing to say, but Lamalmost certain that Mr. Gordon Craig is the personage inthe English theatre to-day who most 44 matters . True,in one sense he is not 44 in " the theatre at all; he pro- duces nothing, has no theatre of his own, makes a for- tune for no playwright, exploits no players, but, in spiteof these things—or perhaps because of them—he loomswith a dreadful indistinct importance. No man in theEnglish theatre is so hated and reviled, no man so pas- sionately defended and revered. A man who can arouse such reelings of hatred andlove can indubitably be no nonentity. People do notguash their teeth and foam at the mouth over somethingthat does not matter, but foam and gnash the theatredoes over Mr. Craig, and he evidently matters to a veryintense degree. It is a little difficult to say just why(though it is easy to say that he is a genius, and thatgenius always makes itself felt), and, turning over thepages of the current number of " The Mask *, I tried todiscover what exactly was his secret, and why our attentionis so arrested. For there is no doubt he does arrest it. " The Mask " is an amazing publication.I confess that, as a general rule, I am bored to extinc- tion by theatrical history and theatrical and thatit is almost inconceivable to myself that I should findmyself reading with avidity of the plays witnessed byJohn Evelyn in London in the middle of the seventeenthcentury. Extracts from his diary, together with Mr. Craig'scomments thereon, fill a large portion of this Mask ,and I find myself reading every word greedily. Does myinterest spring from Mr. Craig's passionate, almost pathetic,interest in the theatre, or is it awakened only by his ownfine, vivid style ? But he has the faculty of inspiringothers. Every page of 44 The Mask ' glows. Comparedwith any other theatrical paper I know, it is as ginger- ale long-opened is to champagne. This yellow magazinebubbles, is gay and provocative and sometimes perverseand absurd, but most often wise and serious, and at everymoment stimulating. It is as easy to imagine falling asleepat one's own execution as nodding over 44 The Mask . When I am feeling depressed I wonder whether thereis any 44 art " of the theatre worth making a pother about,but then the vision rises of this middle-aged Englishmanin Florence (or is it in Rapallo ?) breaking his heart overit, and my spirits rise and I feel there must be somethingfor him to break his heart about. But his heart is verynearly broken. He knows it when, having dreamed ofan interchange (4&lt; not as propaganda, but to give delight )of artists between the countries of the world, he cries out :44 I can see this because I am blind. But some one touchesme on the shoulder as I write, and my pen slows down.As though in a train that has stopped at no station,but by some hedgerow; everyone popping heads outfrom the windows and having sensational moments. Butthere is nothing really sensational: rather, a dull fact thestoker is drunk; and what but intoxicated am I with thishope of what never was and what never will be ? " Andbecause we know that his heart is very nearly broken,we continue to harry him and gibe him (though, as some- one else in the magazine says with perfect ruth, hehas done nothing to interfere with our success in thetheatre), The quarry is panting, is very nearly down;if we can keep the hunt going a very little longer, hewill be only hound's meat. But I feel that Mr. Craigwould be the last person in the world to wisn anyone tomake a poor mouth about him, and I content myself withsaying that if we have not given him a theatre he hasgiven us the best theatrical magazine in the world. * October 1924.

J. B. IN November, in one final downpour of rain, the PrinceI of Wales, in an excellent speech, closed the big EmpireExhibition after what has been undoubtedly a great success.Financial success is not the only success, and of coursethe Exhibition has cost much more money than it tookin. But the Nation, and its exhibitons at Wembley, willobviously win back far more than they will be able tocalculate. They will make money, and wonder why, andperhaps not attribute it to this big show. But it is theshow which will have done it all the same.And what of the rain ? The picture of thousandsof soaking Londoners with umbrellas is possibly an endu- ring sight.,., would it be any less so had provision beenmade to keep them dry?We suggest that architects be allowed to control thebuilding of future exhibitions ; being practical people, ar- chitects know all about how to protect crowds of peoplefrom great rains and great heat. They employ the arch,the arcade, and many devices to do this. A good architectalso makes a fine looking piece of work, and the EmpireExhibition was not a fine looking piece of work.We also suggest that our next Pageant be somehowmade rather more original, five or six times less vast, andcost a third of the sum.It has surprised many people to learn that the Pa- geant cost a sum of money sufficient to have given Englanda couple of Theatres in which to house its Drama, whichDrama they say is in a poor plight. If it be so, one ofthe reasons would seem to be, that there is too muchmoney in England, not too little. Yet how often do peoplewho, one would think, should know better, privately orpublicly inform all of us who would like to see goodthings well supported that there is no money. What a horrid fib! BOOK REVIEWS. / PROFETI DI BABILONIA byG. F. Malipiero. Bottega di Poesia,Milano. Price 15 lire.THIS Milanese Publishing Companyproduces a quantity of books, someprinted very badly, and some excel- lently. It uses a poor sandy sort ofpaper without sufficient reason : for ifthere is no perfect paper in Italy, youngItalians could soon make some.It is all nonsense nowadaysto say there is no this, no that, withan awakened Italy easily able to makeeverything and make it perfectly.Anyhow, Signor Malipiero makesall he makes perfectly ; and this de- lightful book of scenes, letters, andextracts collected from 18th centurywritings by Chiari, Carlo and GaspareGozzi, Calsabigi, Affo, Algarotti, Ar- teaga, Metastasio, Milizia, and manyothers, with an excellent preface andnotes by Malipiero himself, is as goodas it could be.The subject is the Theatre : theyall speak of the Theatre of their time;and, as they are all serious men, thecollection is an important one, ....insome ways the most important whichexists.The book consists of 438 pages ofadmirable writing with one plate, iswell covered, distinguished in appearance,and costs only fifteen lire. It is, bythe way, dedicated to an Englishman.Fourteen more books are announcedin this series, 44 I Fascicoli Musicali ",of which this is the first.We could do without a good half- dozen of them: for example, 44 Neronedi Boito " by Guj ; 44 Opera andDrama " by Wagner; 44 Falstaff diG. Verdi " by della Corte ; 44 Beet- hoven " by Rolland; and 44 Debussy "by Perracchio. It is Italians, not Ger- mans and Frenchmen, we want toknow better.As for Boito and Verdi, I some- times feel that too much time hasalready been devoted to these remar- kably famous composers.More time given to telling us about the lesser known composers and libret- tists and their assistants is what welook for now. More about Pepoli,Albergatti and Contarini, and theirhouses and teatrini: more of Bibienaand his family, of the Galliari family,of the Mauri (or Mauro) family: ofF. C. Motta, of Petronio Nanni, andRivani; of the singers and dancerswho are out-shaddowed today by theeternal 44 return visit " of FarineSloand Cafarello.What of Sancta Stella, and Pi- stocci, what of architects like Sighizzi?How is it that seemingly no book orbooklet exists telling us all about hisservice to the Theatre }1 believe all these figures wait forSignor Malipiero to give them placeand prominence, in a new book, forhe has away of dealing with thesefine things and people which does ho- nour to them. WOMAN IN WORLD HISTORY.HER PLACE IN THE GREATRELIGIONS, by E. M. White.Herbert Jenkins. 8/6 net.WE dont quite like the title of thebook : ....however. Do we likethe book ? In it the author is statedto have 44 ransacked the ages and roam- -44 ed the world to trace woman's44 influence in the story of civilization,44 with special reference to the great44 religions, and to their effect on the44 position of womanhood. As the44 term religion has been taken in its44 broadest sense, it has included ail44 the social and artistic spheres which44 each religion has touched, and there- -44 fore the book covers nearly all the44 field of woman's history. The aim44 has been appreciation before criticism,44 and the conclusions reached are44 neither anti-man nor anti-feministCertainly, in her 395 pages, MissWhite gives us a great deal that isinteresting in regard to the life ofwomen, from primitive times, and downthrough ancient Egypt, Babylonia andAssyria, through Hinduism, Buddhism,Mahammedanism and Judaism, throughancient Greece and Rome, and downfrom the beginning of the Christian Erato the present time : and her work isthe more useful because it is non-pole- mical : she has neither the frenzieddesire to prove that woman is at allpoints the equal of man 44 only better ",a desire, even if one which is neverrealized, that characterizes certain ....toocertain.... feminist writers : nor has shethe inborn contempt for women whichdetracts from the value of the writing#of certain virulent anti-feminists. Her only aim is to 4race down through theages certain influences which reactedupon, and emanated from, one half ofthe human species ; and the ways inwhich, in different periods, they roseto or lapsed from the fullest accom- plishment of their especial functions andprivileges as individuals and in relationto man and to the human family atlarge. It is not an unambitious aim,and we would recommend this bookto the study of those who have oftendisputed the conviction, now and againexpressed by writers in 44 The Maskthat women are not exactly in theirright place upon the stage : they maylearn here that it was not any sign ofthe belittlement of women by men, orof degradation, or undue weakness ontheir own part, when they preferredto hold their lives aloof from publicity,and especially from what a Russianauthor has called 44an amorous display"before a public, for that spoilt public'sentertainment.It is a vexed question, I mustadmit ; whether it be better to sufferthe slings and arrows, or to take armsagainst a sea ... and end the troubles.And I for one rather like to seeone role always acted by a woman:I refer to the part of 44 Hamlet,... **with of course a man in the role ofthe 44 player queen '\ MASKS AND DEMONS.

RESTORATION COMEDY byBonamy Dobree. The ClarendonPress. Oxford. 6/— net.THE Publishers announce that 44 This44 book gives a general view of44 Comedy in the period from Etherege44 to Farquhar, and places certain aspects44 of Restoration Comedy in a new44 light. It investigates more thoroughly44 than has yet been done the vexed44 question of French influence, and44 proves by ample quotation that Res- -44 toration Comedy was, in the main,44 a natural development of late Eliza- -44 bethan work. But the principal 44 content is a description and criticism44 of the work of the chief writers44 of the period, apart from any44 theoryYes, and the whole thing is welldone ; but where are the plays ?This charming book of 182 pagesgives us quite a number of passagesfrom the plays, as though the authorhad really felt as he went along thathe really couldn't continue to talk,(and talk so well) about them whilewe, his hearers, were left utterly in thedark as to what he was talking about.So he strikes a wax vesta now andagain and points to the pictures : 44 Yousee what 1 mean ", he seems to sayas he quotes a bit; at which outgoes the quotation, and we are againplunged in obscurity.The fact is there are very few ofus who know these plays well enough ;and I feel that Mr ten chapterswould have been only in their rightplace as prefaces to the plays of thesix authors on whom he discourses.Without the plays the book is butdelightful meandering.On page 138, for example, Mr Do- htie tells us that, 44 a thread of sadness44 and disillusion runs through these44 plays, and live passions break through44 the veil of cynicism wherewith the44 critical comedy clothes itself. We44 pierce through the social world to44 the realm of our underlying motives,44 to our ardours and desires, for beauty44 as well as for grosser satisfactions ;44 and Congreve reveals himself as a44 poet pleading for finer living ".Well, the thread of what you willmay run where it likes, but unless wecan be helped to follow it we areprone to grow a little sleepy.It is of no use to say that " weoierce through the social world , andthat 44 Congreve reveals himself ", for,lacking the plays, no such blessed re- velation can be ours.In short, speech about a thing lacksall sanity without the hearers are firsttold what it's all about and until theycan judge for themselves. A vaguerecollection of Shakespeare is somethingto us when we come to read Coleridgeon his plays. And besides, we allhave a Shakespeare in the house. Butwhen it comes to a play by Etheregeand Shadwell, or even Congreve, unlessthe play be in the same volume andjoined to the discourse about it, weshall never be lured by the orator toread the play, to go out and hunt fora copy, to buy the play or listen to theorator; and it's quite likely we shalldamn the best otator and wonder whythe publisher didn't have enough faith in the Drama itself and had too mucnin the critic of it.It is futile to hope that we shallbe sent by Mr Dobr£e to Etherege,for there is not time in 1925 for eventhe average man to go trotting around ;and I for one will wager that very fewof the exceptional men will have timeto do so.Besides, there are too few and tooexpensive Congreves and Ethereges inthe market. WANTED a shillingCongreve : ....and for our part wewant that volume prefaced by MrDobr^e.Yes, there's something in it, isn'tthere ? LIFE OF WILLIAM CONGREVEbu Edmund Gosse C. B. Heinemann.7/6.MR Gosse is always gallant, and sohe was one of the earliest, if notthe very first, to write the Life ofCongreve.He might have written the Life ofEtheridge, but what would there havebeen gallant in such an act as that ?No. Congreve the bore, that's theman to stand by, to prop up, forcebefore the Public, stick to, and finallytriumph with.That's the splendid English gallantryof it, and in Mr Gosse gallantry glowswith a steady dame.When I speak of Congreve as abore, I only mean that he fails to bebrilliant like Etheridge or powerful likeWycherley. He meanders, he has grace,he is charming, .... he is, in fact, aperfect bore.What pains he is at to make nofaults, this perfect Congreve. But itis Mr Gosse and his book we have toconsider, and it seems to me as goodtoday as it was when it first appearedsome years ago.Written probably with great difficulty,it has about it all the signs of easywriting.What is known of Congreve is allthere, and what is known is reallyhardly worth recording.How remarkable then that so greatan impression has been made with thisbook upon all of us. THE THEATRE: IDEAS ANDIDEALS. J. W. H. Faulkner.A. Stockwell, London. 2/—.| wonder whether Mr Faulkner isi quite correct in his statement that44 the first Theatre was built by theGreeks between three and four hundredyears before Christ " ? I have an idea that theatres existedlong before that.And I wonder, is Mr Faulknercorrect when he says that 44 An Exhi- -44 bition of Paintings, a Concert, a44 Recital of Verses, a Display of Dan- -44 cing.... none of these are entertain- -44 ments ".I wonder what he would call Po- litics, as we receive them daily throughthe newspaper. I, who am a theatre- goer, rather resent seeing so muchdrama made out of politics in ourDaily Papers. It makes me quite bo- red when 1 go to hear a play.The ideas and ideals set forth inthis little booklet of 32 pages arefreshly stated and familiar to us. Themore often they are repeated (providedanyone listens) the better for the Londonstage.Unfortunately in London hardlyanyone has time to listen, except tohis own voice. What with having toget through a hard day's work, andhaving to sit through the wrong playat night, (for it's difficult to back awinner each time), listening has to beput off until our August days at Mar- gate, when all we want to listen tothen is what are the tame waves saying.But everyone belonging to the Bri- tish Drama League should assuredlypurchase this two shillings's worth ofIdeas and Ideals, and do their verybest to spread them through the lengthand breadth of the land.But the first thing to do is to per- suade people to listen, SMARAGDAS LOVER ; A Dra- matic Phantasmagoria by IV. /. Tur- ner. Chatto &amp; IVindus. 5j-MR W. J, Turner has a verystrong, a very genuine sense ofthe Theatre. It is needless to tellhim he avoids coming to the ordinaryHecuba or to warn him not to betempted away by unrealities, for it isjust by wandering exactly where hewanders that he will come across thereal lady, There will then be nodoubt at all what Hecuba is to himand He to Hecuba. She 11 be rightthere, tragic or comic as he wills.Meantime, spite of this essential giftof his, he has not come across herthis time. But he is almost there.This is not a little to be able tosay. For he hasn't been looking forher in any of the places she longago left.His Phantasmagoria is a wierd andenchanting comedy which 1 think theEnglish actors of our day could make verylittle out of. When you have read it, if you have an eye to its exploitation on themodern stage, you more than likely closethe volume with the word ** unsatis- factory " but what else can a thingof this kind be ? is not a Phantasma- goria " a crowd or succession of dimor doubtfully real figures " ?In any event it is good reading forit moves along and without effort, solong as one remembers that nothing isquite real. Sometimes it exceeds evenUnreality, not only in the situations butin the very speeches, as, for example,when the Prime Minister in the playsays of Sir Leo Edward Meyer," Extraordinary people these Jews!All the world s shadiest transactionsare done in their houses but neverby them ".Again I come to the principal de- fect in all plays, and that is not anyfault committed by the authors. Thisdefect is that we are fast asleep inEngland so far as our Theatre is con- cerned. Proof: This.... Were we awakewe wouid of course produce this dramawithin the month; and the same au- thor's " Popomac " play would havecome (come and gone, or come andstayed) at least a year ago.But no, we are asleep. And howwe dream, to be sure. We dreamthat by selecting what we think to beexcellent plays made in the right waywe may get at last at the plays.Gloriously comic, crazy, dream. Weshall get at last at the plays if weproduce without any pausing or anysilly sort of superior hesitation, everyplay which every writer of even fairtalent, has the courage to pen.We shall produce them cheaply,rapidly and well. It is quite easy todo it cheaply and well provided you'rerapid about it.We shall thus put upon the stagemany hundreds of new plays each year,three or four of which will provetheir worth, thirty, or forty their promise,and some hundreds will pass away.We (sleeping) dream that we canbe cleverer than that. Utter delu- sion.In any case I hope Mr Turnerwill write and publish every play thathe has even the faintest desire to writeand publish, even if the London stageis not yet awake: for we want to seeall that he has in his imagination;technically we see what he might doshould he wish to ; but if the Theatrewill go on dreaming he cannot exactlyexercise that wish to any great extent.The English stage is in the condi- tion it was in years ago, Men of ta- lent exist who should be given Thea- tres so as to wake it up. Till it wakes up the work of thousands of writers,actors, producers, will be wasted, andI do not believe England can affordto waste in this manner, I wont call itshameful; it is merely excessively stupid A GUIDE TO CAPER by ThomasBodkin and Denis Eden.

Mr Edenis a new name to us, but there is no- thing at all of the beginner about hiswork.The second picture, the last picture,the ninth, tenth and eleventh picturesall play with light. If the sun is downthe moon shines; or a fire, or the starstwinkle, and it is this light which givesus so much happiness when we lookat these inhabitants of Caper, living themost sensible existence man could everlive, even after thinking about it foryears.I am an entire admirer of this ar- tist. I have nothing to find faultwith,... the whole thing is perfect.And not the least perfect thing aboutit is Messrs Chatto &amp; Windus's ins- .tinct or judgement, in having recogni- zed in Mr Eden an artist of first classfancy. Just as courtesy is in everytouch, so is there courtesy in the wayit has been brought out.Charm is a word which extends tohoydens, Mrs Jordan was charmingThis book is more than that.... andthe way it has been issued by thepublishers, its paper, its covers, wrap- per, title page and all, reveals an un- derstanding for which I can find nobetter word than courtesy.

I feel that thisone came out in the wrong season.I am in a cold room as I read thispoem, and I wonder why it does notgo easily. Not Miss Sitweli's fault, butmine to be so placed twixt the cold andthis deep sea.Obviously Miss Sitwell is full of gifts, clever, a poet, ....a graceful one;and with an ability to go on.As I read it I find myself unableto believe that the Sleeping Beauty isa theme any poet could make anythingmore out of than has Miss Sitwell.

The average fee for a three actplay is five pounds per performanceMonica Ewer, in" Play Production for Everyone EDITORIAL NOTES. THE ITALIAN THEATRE.THE old Italian Theatre, and bythat we mean its professional Thea- tre as it is today, pleases us so muchthat, unless very fine innovations aremade, we would respectfully suggestthat it is perhaps better for the Ita- lians to avoid novelties.Thek Theatre is not the first inEurope because of the elegance andcomfort of its poltrone and its palchi(there England and America lead),nor because scenographically it is suf- ficient, or because it is developing anew group of excellent playwrights.It is first by virtue of its first-classacting and singing, because acting andsinging come to Italians apparently withimmense ease ....not because of anycleverness, which after all is a verysmall thing at best.First they have a language; theyknow how to speak it : they nevermumble, drawl, are never foggy; allis crisp, deliberate, and rapid. Theyknow how to carry themselves ; theyare born professionals ; they 44 actthey do not pretend to deceive usthat they are 44 realYet while acting they never play at44 make believe " ; they do not imi- tate toy soldiers and fashion plates andstatuary. While they are never unrealin that sense, 44 Realism" has neverbeen thinkable to them, for they knowwhat is what, and find Realism a6laughable as they find forced arti- ficiality depressing.This it is which we think placesall Italian actors in another sphere tothe actors of Russia, who are bornrealists and deuced serious about it all,or born copyists of statuary, engra- vings, wooden toys and the like. Ita- lian actors are not like German actors,who are always earnest and clever butnever quite the thing. Certainly En- glish actors are the most gentlemanlyin Europe ; and French actors, everthe neatest; but Italian actors are ac- tors before Abraham was,So that when nowadays innovationsare made in the way that the 44 Indepen- denti ", the 44 Tetiteatro " or T£thys- Theatre make them, or as Signor Bra- gaglia makes them, we regret to saythat they ring false. The 44 innovators "do nothing original.It is all what we call rather cheap.We have seen the designs for thenew 44 Teatro del Convegno " and itstrikes us they are curiously poor.If Italy possessed the knack for imi- tating northern nations, it would nothave waited twenty years to seize onthe notion used now as an inn vationfor the new stage of the 44 Teatro delConvegnoThe 44 Piccola Canobbiana " de- signs for stage machines and audito- rium and proscenium are no better.Sironi's designs for 44 I cavalieri "are influenced by northern notions butare not at all good.As for Signor Bragaglia, he hasmuch excellent energy, little judgmentand no originality. He catches holdof all the notions he can find in thebooks of the last twenty-five years,and on a small stage he manages tohuddle them all together, bringing outmuch printed matter to announce theirexistence. The whole effect is that ofa mis-fit. Of course he does notadmit where he has gathered most ofthese notions : he seems to think thatthey are public property. By thus usingthem he becomes one of the public.We don't like it a bit. Signor Bra- gaglia can, we feel sure, do better, ....ordo less. It's not at all worthy of theimmense tradition of the Italian stage.Italians have imagination, have alwayshad it. So that to echo and to copyis, in an Italian, very poor, and in noway represents the new spirit whichhas inspired Italy to stand on its ownmerits in all things, and which seemsto possess enough force to last out thecenturies.The Facist Theatre, when it comes,will be one of the blossoms of thisNew Italy which today has no timeto turn to thoughts of blossoming, sinceits sole thought is the natural one, ....thatof spreading roots.Plenty of time for the arts later on.Inevitably those arts will blossom intime. Meanwhile these sad attemptsto 44 innovate *' in the grand Italiantheatre are rather ridiculous; and thenotion that the Italian spectators, aretaken in cannot be maintained for amoment. A POET'S THEATRE.MR John Masefield has built him- self a theatre at Boar's Hill, nearOxford.44 What ridiculous nonsense " is the • verdict of those foik who cannot al- r low that a Theatre may be other thanthe swagger Teatro Fenice in Veneziaor the Prinz Regenten in Munchen,As though Selva and Semper (or: whoever built the Wagner Theatre)are to be the only model husbandmen.Who knows better than a Dramaticpoet what kind of Theatre is suited to hisplays ? We understand that the PoeticDrama by several poets will be presentedby Mr Masefield at his playhouse, whichis a simply constructed building in hisgarden, and is designed to accommodateabout one hundred persons. A firstproduction has been already given, andafter Christmas it is hoped that an Eliza- bethan comedy may be produced. Thestage is broad and sceneries are notgoing to be allowed to be a nuisance.One London paper was cruel enoughto say that 44 artistic curtains " wouldbe used in place of the sceneries. Asa matter of fact we believe A that MrMasefield has around him a group ofdisciples, not studying how to write,but helping Mr Masefield how to playat theatres.And in our opinion to play at Thea- tres in England is the very best thingone could possibly do. And if in thecountry, the country way of doing thisis the right way. That is why weutterly disbelieve the shocking suggestionof 44 artistic curtains Country thatchcountry wattles, country oak planks,...any of these as a background if youlike; there is danger in "artistic curtains *they are apt to catch fire. But then thiswould assuredly bring Mr Masefield'splayhouse all the advertisement fromwhich we think a country theatre shouldbe entirely exempt, but which the prac- tical man, even if he be in the desert,thinks is necessary.The unfortunate fate of too manya country playhouse is that it becomesthrough advertisement, just what thepoet would hate it to be, ....what thepoet never for a moment suspected itwas being lured to be ; that is to say,a bit of a sensation.We recall the fate of several coun- try, or semi-rural, playhouses, Before ayear was out someone (assuredly notthe Poet) had been over-energetic;(that 4 practical * person over again) ithad been dragged or pushed up toLondon, where it played a while andwent out, puff, like a lamp.Why, after having chosen a noblerural spot as the place of places fora Theatre, a dash should be made atthe first chance for London, is puzzling.Goethe, who played with Theatres,played with a real playhouse ....inWeimar.... with a Court as well as the towns-people as spectators. Heworked hard at this playhouse of his,and it was even less than the poodleyou will remember which caused hisdownfall as Theatre Director. It waseven Fraulein Caroline Jagemann.And there have been other poets whofor a time have had little playhouses.Voltaire had one at Ferney. Here,about 1776, Lekain stopped for somedays to perform to a select and ap- preciative audience. At Cirey, too,Voltaire had a playhouse of his own :and some years earlier had one in hisvilla at Vernier, but we never hear ofhim suddenly carrying his charming ifamateur troupe to Paris or Berlin.We have not seen any drawings orengravings of these Theatres, but in1772, (about the time of the Ver- nier theatricals) it was customary tobe too magnificent rather than toosimple. The playhouse was a wordwhich stood for something with style,a sparkle of swagger in it. The poetAlbergatti liked things to look well- dressed, and so his theatre in Zolanear Bologna was the very thing. Alittle bit of a village this same Zola,but then a big piece of a Chateau,and in the Chateau some Teatrinoas Mr Stein would say, to seat threehundred people. And the poet Pe- poli.... how many theatres he built inhis houses in Venezia and Bolognaand in his villas at Codalunga andelsewhere has not yet been decided.But it is on record that he not onlyhad his own plays and those of otherpoets performed in them, but alsooperas in prose and ballets, in whichPepoli danced, 44 the best dancer ofthem all " says the historian.But of all private country theatresthat at Esterhaz, whpre Haydn livedfor many years writing his divine thingsfor the only quite divine performers....for marionnefctes.... is the country thea- tre we like to think of most. Haydnand Masefield would have got on welltogether, we believe. What a pitythat the old Count Esterhazy of thosedays is no more among us to show usall h0w.... exactly h0w.... a countrytheatre should be set before the King :—or rather before himself and hishousehold. But as he is not with us,and as no lord seems to have retainedthe old tricks that lords once played,we must be content when a poet orany other artist rigs out a theatre forhimself. Its not the thing to d 0;...6 Art for Art s sake* is no fun at all;and theatre for theatre's even less: butwhat would you ?... when a poet isat the same time a grand Signore hecan do these things as some of us 5 think they should be done ; when he, has only his crown of laurels, even ifi he do them better, he cannot do them&gt; as they should be done.5 Mr Masefield will do them like a sim- ple English poet, and that means he will&gt; do them just as well as they can pos- sibly be done; and those of us who, cannot be there, will feel envious of thosewho can, and who will hear beautifulverse spoken as it should be spoken.See plate 2 and page 75 for someidea of what a little private Theatre\ meant in the 18th century, Ed, VALUELESS NEWS.THE Observer in its issue for No- vember 2nd. had an exceptionallyfunny twenty-five lines about a BerlinTheatre. Here it is :EVEN BERLIN SHOCKED.THE DRAMA TIC THE A TRECOMES TO GRIEF.The movement of a few enthu- siasts to help forward the great bandof unacted dramatists has received acrushing blow. The new " DramaticTheatre ", which opened with everyencouragement from the critics, andwhich produced George Kaiser's " Bil- les and Jeanne " as its first Venture,has since alienated every type of au- dience by a succession of extravagantplays violating all canons of goodtaste even in so exceptionally broad- minded a city as Berlin.The result is a triumph for thewatchful Clerical Centre party, whosemembers have their own theatre league,but needed their own house. Whilethe Social-Democrats support their ownexcellent " People's Theatre whichcarefully avoids plays of reactionarytendency, the t€Dramatic Theatre"has now become the home of the po- litical Catholics, whose taste in dramais characterised not so much by pro- paganda as by elimination. This rulesout, for instance, not only three-cor- nered problems, but divorce in itsentirety. This is a triumph for theideals of the Centre, which would passunnoticed in a Catholic province, butis a sign of its renewed activity inBerlin.What foolery and what cliches !Really, it is time to ask even thiswell-nigh perfect journal to make ascrap of its Foreign Theatre Correspon- dents and start afresh.For some time we have studiedcarefully the theatrical news sent to44 The Observer " from Wien, Berlin,and Budapest; and have wondered howlong Mr Garvin would let it go on. s Why is . foreign theatrical news£ necesary to "The Observer", unlessi it be either very entertaining or veryinforming ?We suppose that the only people1 who feel the necessity are those whoare ever active in informing London&gt; that the North European Theatre is: quite the most important upon earth.I Hundreds of English actors doubt- less read 44 The Observer ", but theywill surely not be impressed by thenonsense which week after week issent from Wien, Berlin and Pest.For example what the dickens isthere of interest in this twaddle fromBerlin about some Theatre which is44 the home of the political Catholics"and 4 4 whose taste is characterised byelimination " ? And how comes it thatthis or any taste 44 rules out " divorcein its entirety, and how is this 44 atriumph for the ideals of the Centre " ?And then, 44 Catholic province 44 re- newed activity ", 44 watchful clericalcentre party ", 44 broadminded city ofBerlin .—Really, 44 Observer "! youwho are the very pride of journalismand our delight, to accept such Pro- paganda from the Theatre of Elimi- nation in Berlin is not what you cameinto existence to do. To hear fromWien or Budapest that an audiencehas sat spellbound, or that one couldhave heard a pin drop, hardly carriesas far as London.Besides, what Austria and Germanydo in Theatres, is not half as importantas the good 44 Observer" seems tothink. If there is space that needs fill- ing, we know of a good number of peo- ple who could make that space glitter.There is much being done in theEuropean and American Theatre weekby week; but, strange as this maysound to some ears, it is not alwaysto be found inside a playhouse.For example, a book now andagain appears which does more toadvance the European Theatre thantwo years of energetic acting and pro- ducing will do. Yet we hear nothingof this b00k,... or next to nothing. Afoolish conference is held, and it is re- ported gravely. Or a new society for- med, and reported as gravely. No dis- cernment is shown by the reportstwixt what is of value and what worth- less. This is a pity and a great wasteof valuable space, time and money.w Observer n will pardon this pre- sumption from the smallest serious paperon earth to the largest and most im- portant;... but it is n The Mask's "speciality, this little matter of Thea- tres. Like all specialists it things itknows. Who knows,... perhaps it may. VENEZIA AND PROGRESS. TO judge from some recent articlesin 44 The Manchester Guardian "and 44 The Daily Telegraph " peopledo not seem to realize in England thatItaly is not a Museum or a Theatre,and that its Cities, however superb,have no wish to crumble just to obligethe tourists and the archeologists.Italy looks on it that life comesfirst, and all the rest comes after.And if electric motors are to beof any aid towards bringing to lifepart of Venezia or of any other city inItaly, what sort of being is it that willcry out about this ? Venezia and thecities of Italy are not for him, theyare for those who live and work anddie there.44 The Mask " is all for the Arts.You know that, we think. But onlyfor Art which comes along because apeople is alive. When a city is dead,a nation drugged, a continent dulled,Art had better wait awhile in thatcity, nation or continent.True, perhaps, that around somecities (did the Italian nation wish it)a wall or a line might be drawn withorders given that it was too good anexample of ancient work to be dis- turbed. Such a place might be ropedoff and put apart as a National Mo- nument, and outside its walls a newcity built. Inside its walls the veryplainest but cleanest accommodationmight be provided for all who wishedto study and work there in the monu- ment, as in a vast Biblioteca, andspecial permissions granted to such onthat understanding. We have oftenfelt that cities like Venezia or San Gi- mignano might well be reserved forsuch a purpose.But if the cities must be used, andmust be brought up to date, why not ?Where is Shakespeare's, Bacon's andElizabeth's London ? Has the loss ofthat particular place (and lost it is)been no gain ? And if Titian's, Tie- polo's and the Doges' Venezia shouldwhere would be the loss ? Tous, yes; to you, yes, to many thou- sands yes, ....but to many millions,probably no. * What use in architecturefor which the millions of people have nocare, which new laws no longer love ?Gondolas are pretty boats, and toglide is sometimes a pleasant necessity,and a canal is not always as bad asit seems. But, since Shakespeare's Playsare not valued by us, Englishmen hadbetter, we think, pause before too has- tily criticizing their Venetian friends.How comes it that we Englishcriticize ? Is it just because we somehow be- lieve Venezia to belong to us, ....to beour honeymoon spot, our playground.And what are we ? a nation ofpeople more forward than any in prai- sing speed, electricity, cinema, liste- ning-in ; ....and we quickly produce amillion pounds if promised a safe in- vestment in something up-to-date anda curse to everyone. In Manchester we weakly give overa poor cheap little National Theatreto a Cinema firm: with a lot of wordprotest yet without read resistence, weyield it up; yet we have the audacityto tell Venezia from Manchester to keepitself unspotted from the monopoly forthe supply of .motors. Private enterprise could have savedfor Manchester its Theatre Royal; andhad the 44 Manchester Guardian " spo- ken with the spirit it so often showsin other matters, (ie, in money matters)no commonplace motor-driven cinemacould have come into the TheatreRoyal.When Manchester can save oneTheatre, and a grand old place like theTheatre Royal, it will be quite timeenough for Manchester to lecture Ve- nezia. AS OTHERS SEE ....LONDON. J. S. CAN anyone tell us what causedSir Alfred Butt or the DruryLane Committee to place Mr BasilDean at the head of Drury LaneTheatre ?According to George Jean Nathanof New York, Dean would seem tobe a man of very small talent, asthe following passage from an articlein 44 The American Mercury " willshow. Dean has been over in NewYork producing plays. We want tosee a man put into Drury Lane whohas no time to go to New York orNewhaven to produce anything.Nathan says that "It is not James44 Elroy Flecker's 44 Hassan " that has44 failed, it is Mr Basil Dean's. Flecker44 wrote a play rich in the music of44 romance and poesy, as beautiful a" thing of its kind as has appeared44 in recent dramatic literature ; Dean" staged it with all the imagination4 4 and rhythm of a sailor's smoker.44 The production, indeed, served as a44 piquant example of the low level to44 which the English stage, in this44 respect, has sunk. Dean is regarded44 as one of the best and most artistic44 of London producers, Over here,44 they do finer work up alleys;" I have passed an eye over seven 44 or eight of Dean's productions, three44 in New York and the others in44 England. All of them have been44 drolly incompetent. Not only has4 4 the gentleman apparently no sense of44 the dramatic, not only is he seeming- 44 ly quite innocent of the technic of44 projecting a manuscript over the44 footlights, but he is, to boot, utterly44 without a sense of beauty and a44 sense of form. His ideas of scenic44 investiture go back to the day when44 furniture was painted on the back- 44 drop and when a 'big production '44 was any one in which the stage44 was so packed and crowded with44 scenery and irrelevant but costly44 props that the actors had to make44 their entrances from the wings side- 44 ways. His ideas of lighting are so44 absurdly antiquated that even some44 of the most patriotic London re- 44 viewers have difficulty in concealing44 their derisory hiccups. For Dean44 appears to believe that all that is44 necessary to achieve some exception- 44 ally nobby illumination effects are44 a half dozen vari coloured gelatine44 slides supplemented by an indefati- 44 gable fellow stationed at the dimmer,44 He sought to evolve mystery with44 a mere blue light and romance with44 a pink one. In the matter of dra- 44 matic suggestion, he was equally44 unhappy. His scenes of melodrama44 were painstakingly languid ; his scenes44 of physical passion, as, for exam- 44 pie, the one wherein the fair Yasmin44 conquers the flesh of Hassan, were44 as sexual as playing postoffice.44 Thus was a beautiful poem with*4 its beautiful incidental music of Fre- 44 derick Delius and with all its poten- 44 tial stage wonder reduced to no- 44 thing ".This comes of being possessed of anability to push into Drury Lane with- out credentials* This comes of dis- honest theatrical Criticism.London is slowly being made alaughing stock by this sort of thing,and it is time the London Press saidso clearly.Unfortunately Walkley, Archer,Grein and a few others do nothing toimprove matters. They either are cy- nical about our stage or gush aboutits worst elements. Not that Walkleyor Archer err about playwrights ; butto Theatricals they are sense-blind,Grein is not blind; he is merely ut- terly unfitted for a responsible position as a critic of our English Theatre.
