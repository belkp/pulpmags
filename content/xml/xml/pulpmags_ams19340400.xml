O'GONOR SLOANE, Ph.D.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A POINT as a scientific conception</seg><seg type="columnLine">is defined as location without size</seg><seg type="columnLine">or space. It may be taken as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the origin or starting point of meas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urements and dimensions. It is non-di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mensional space, which is a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">contradictory way of putting it, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes happens that contradictions</seg><seg type="columnLine">do explain things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So starting with our point suppose we</seg><seg type="columnLine">move it along and its trace or track is</seg><seg type="columnLine">left after it as it proceeds. This gives</seg><seg type="columnLine">us a line, which taken in the abstract,</seg><seg type="columnLine">has length and nothing else. It may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">entitled space of one dimension, for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">has no width or height. Now move the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line along in a direction other than that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its length and it gives us a plane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which has length and width but no</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickness. Therefore it is space of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensions. A good deal of use has</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">been made of the conception of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, and of a two dimensional being,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who could be imprisoned by laying a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thread in a closed figure around him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next we may move our plane in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction other than either that of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">length and breadth. This gives a third</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimension and we have a solid. We are</seg><seg type="columnLine">three dimensional beings, our surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings are three dimensional and we seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have reached the limiting number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensions. It requires a vivid imagina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to formulate a four dimensional</seg><seg type="columnLine">object. But the effort is a frequent one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we find the attempt made to depict</seg><seg type="columnLine">a four dimensional solid or ultrasolid</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is called a tessaract. This word</seg><seg type="columnLine">is derived from the Greek word for</seg><seg type="columnLine">four. It is perfectly fair to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounce the effort a failure in its result--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tesseract tells nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CONIC SECTIONS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When it comes to defining four di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mensional space, the fourth dimension is</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes entitled space-time, but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">does not tell us much. In "Paradise</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lost," Milton describes the fallen angels</seg><seg type="columnLine">as discussing "free will, fixed fate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreknowledge absolute," and says they</seg><seg type="columnLine">"find no end in wandering mazes lost."</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is substantially what happens to us</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we try to figure out a four dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional object. We cannot conceive of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor picture it to ourselves; it transcends</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If we think of a plane of limited area</seg><seg type="columnLine">attached to an axis and turned around</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, a curved surface would be formed--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"generated" if we employ more scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific terminology--whose shape would</seg><seg type="columnLine">depend on the contour of the plane, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface would enclose a volume.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus we get a three dimensional ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject from a two dimensional surface by</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple rotation. Surfaces thus formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the solids they enclose are called</seg><seg type="columnLine">respectively surfaces of rotation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">solids of rotation or revolution. Thus a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere is a solid of rotation generated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotating a circle about its diameter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All that we have given may seem ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentary, but it is precisely the elements</seg><seg type="columnLine">which so many of us fail on. A globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a billiard ball is simple enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at, but how often do we picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">their generation by the rotating of circles</seg><seg type="columnLine">around their diameters? The most ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary objects we meet with have their</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual stories to tell us. The very</seg><seg type="columnLine">elements of our knowledge give the</seg><seg type="columnLine">basis for an expanding amount of true</seg><seg type="columnLine">science, a great proportion of which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely missed by too many of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Figure in your imagination a right</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle triangle standing on its base and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotated completely around with its ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tical side as its axis. It will generate</seg><seg type="columnLine">a solid, which is a cone, and this is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">basis of three very important curves</seg><seg type="columnLine">called conic sections. It would be in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">teresting to know what proportion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us could tell what conic sections are.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We may start with the simplest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Let a plane intersect a cone, cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it, being perpendicular to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">axis, or, what is the same thing, parallel</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its base. The surface thus formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">will obviously be a circle and is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first or simplest, we may call it, of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conic sections. Webster refers to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a special case of the ellipse. Now if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane cutting across or intersecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cone is out of parallel with the base</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet not parallel with its side, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">gives an ellipse. In everyday phrase</seg><seg type="columnLine">this is often called an oval, which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite incorrect. An ellipse is like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prolonged or drawn out circle and is</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly symmetrical, while an oval is</seg><seg type="columnLine">one sided, it is of the shape of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">longitudinal section of an egg, by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane through its longer axis. The oval</seg><seg type="columnLine">is therefore of smaller contour at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">end than at the other, and is named</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Latin word ovum, meaning an</seg><seg type="columnLine">egg. But our friend Webster's Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abridged "passes up," as they say the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word "oval," accepting it as the pop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ular name for an ellipse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the plane intersecting the cone is</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclined a little more so as to be par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">allel to its side, a curve is produced, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is closed at one end and open at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other, no matter how large the cone</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be. This is a parabola. Now let</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intersecting plane be parallel to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">axis of the cone and to one side of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we have the hyperbola, another open</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These are the historic and classic conic</seg><seg type="columnLine">sections; taking the circle as an ellipse</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of them are all that can be pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced. There is more than dry mathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matical interest in them. The ellipse</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been used in the design for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">archcs of stone bridges. There is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">method of drawing an approximate el-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lipse using bits of circles or arcs thereof</seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">so as to get an approximation to the true</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve. But this "false ellipse," as it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">called, is considered to give an inferior</seg><seg type="columnLine">architectural effect when compared with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the true ellipse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Waterloo Bridge across the Thames is</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the glories of London and of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great architect, John Rennie. This gives</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effect of the ellipse in bridge con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction, yet the beautiful structure wras</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatened by the powers that be, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">"improvement," in the shape of destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and tearing it down, until London</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose in arms and now it is to be pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another interesting thing to be noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in speaking of the ellipse is that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets in the solar system follow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curves of ellipses in their paths around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great luminary, carrying out several</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious laws in their courses through</seg><seg type="columnLine">space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The line drawn from the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a circle to its periphery is called its</seg><seg type="columnLine">radius. In the ellipse there are two</seg><seg type="columnLine">such lines and they must be spoken of</seg><seg type="columnLine">as radius vectors. The radius of a circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">properly speaking is a radius vector,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the last word is omitted when re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferring to it. Now the earth in follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing its orbit around the sun pursues an</seg><seg type="columnLine">elliptical path. The radius vectors of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ellipse, there are two of them, meet at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all points on its circumference, and our</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, as it were, takes the two radius</seg><seg type="columnLine">vectors along with it, but appropriates</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them to itself, so that its motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">is referred to only one of them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this radius vector varies in length as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes through the three hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty degrees of its course through</seg><seg type="columnLine">space around the sun. The rate of mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion or speed of the earth varies--its</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed is greatest when the radius vec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor is shortest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And here comes the amazingly simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">law telling us that the radius vector of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth, and radius vector of each of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the planets alw-ays sweeps over equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">areas in equal times. Thus a planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">moves over more degrees when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radius vector is short than when it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, and thus is subject to the sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plest kind of a law.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And again we meet another amazingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple law of the motion of the planets</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is approximately exact. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">square of the time of revolution of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet around the sun is proportional to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cube of its mean distance from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great luminary. Suppose a planet is</seg><seg type="columnLine">three times as far from the sun, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">average, as we terrestrials are. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cube of three (3 X 3 X 3=27) is</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-seven. Therefore, the square root</seg><seg type="columnLine">of twenty-seven, which we may take as</seg><seg type="columnLine">five and two-tenths, would be the length</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planet's year, taking the earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">year as one. Or we may multiply 365%</seg><seg type="columnLine">by 5.2 to get the length of the assumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet's year approximately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Simple as these laws are there are al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways annoying fractions to be encounted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The earth's year is not exactly 365V4</seg><seg type="columnLine">days in length, and the relative distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planets from the sun are in de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cidedly fractional proportions, one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ellipse not only is a beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve for an arch, but it tells us one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laws of motion of the planets</seg><seg type="columnLine">through space. It appears in archiec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture and in astronomy, two widely sepa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rated subjects.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If a plane is supposed to pass through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sphere, it will always cut out a circle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cone as we have seen may give any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of three figures when cut by plane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we take the circle as a special case</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ellipse, but the sphere gives only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. I f the plane is passed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">an equator, or any other part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere where it is of largest diameter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it gives what is called a great circle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This brings before us a curious bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">simplicity in geometry. The outside area</seg><seg type="columnLine">CONIC SECTIONS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of a sphere is equal to the area of four</seg><seg type="columnLine">great circles. If you had an absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">spherical or round apple, and cut it</seg><seg type="columnLine">into two equal pieces, the areas of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two cuts would be equal to the area of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outer surface of one of the halves of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the apple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a contrast to this the factor by</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the diameter of a circle must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">multiplied to give the circumference has</seg><seg type="columnLine">never been calculated to its end. It is 3</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed by a decimal which has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried to over one hundred figures, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no hopes of reaching the last one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We may go back to Milton's fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">angels and say that we "find no end in</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandering mazes lost." Probably the</seg><seg type="columnLine">decimal in question is without end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The parabola possesses some features</seg><seg type="columnLine">of interest outside of its mathematical</seg><seg type="columnLine">relations.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">marble swept off a table by a cane or</seg><seg type="columnLine">otherwise, in its fall to the floor will</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow a virtually parabolic curve. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">has the resistance of the aid to modify</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parabola, but its motion is so slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this does not affect it to any ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent. In the case of an artillery projec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tile the resistance of the air counts for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a great deal, because of the high velocity</seg><seg type="columnLine">involved, and the curve followed departs</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the true parabola and is entitled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ballistic curve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If a cord, cable or chain is attached to</seg><seg type="columnLine">two separated places on the same level,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it will hang down in a loop, forming a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve known as a catenary or a "chain</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve."

Carr</seg><seg type="columnLine">would know what to do in a case like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this. He was interested in many things</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides his favorite hobby of scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">research; he dabbled in the mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">and occult; had been through strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventures. The very man to see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wyatt left the subway at Seventy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">second Street. This was one morning his</seg><seg type="columnLine">downtown garage business could go</seg><seg type="columnLine">hang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the spacious drawing room of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carr's apartments, Wyatt waited ner-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vously for his friend. The place was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloomy--the house was one of those old</seg><seg type="columnLine">brownstone fronts in the Seventies--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wyatt paced the floor, then stopped sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly and drew the strange cause of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">perturbation from his pocket, placing it</seg><seg type="columnLine">gingerly on the mantel. He breathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">easier, then laughed aloud at his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">silly fears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Carr greeted him, he broke out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a torrent of swift speech, telling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement the happenings of the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. He drew his friend to the fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">place and indicated the stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There it is," he wound up. "Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me what's so all-fired important</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it and what I'm to do." Wyatt</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in a fernient.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carr picked up the stone and turned it</seg><seg type="columnLine">over between a thumb and forefinger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gray eyes twinkling. "All steamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up this morning, aren't you, Jim?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned. "The idea, waking me up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sound sleep to listen to a yarn like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this. It'll spoil my breakfast."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sorry, old man, but the thing sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of got on my nerves. I had to see you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to tell some one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">M-M." Carr sobered, running</seg><seg type="columnLine">long fingers through his tousled</seg><seg type="columnLine">mop of hair, as wras his habit when</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking deeply. "Well, seeing we've</seg><seg type="columnLine">started the day with such a bang, lets</seg><seg type="columnLine">give a thought to this innocent looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">gem."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not worth anything, is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a great deal, as ornamental stones</seg><seg type="columnLine">go. It's a crocidolite. Most people would</seg><seg type="columnLine">call the thing a South African cat's-eye.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A mineral silicate with silky fibers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored with iron oxide, ordinarily found</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Griqualand West.

Wyatt scratched his chin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed at the staring eye, hypnotized</seg><seg type="columnLine">anew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Creepy thing, at that," mumbled Carr,</seg><seg type="columnLine">peering closely at the stone. He fell si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent, his brow wrinkled in thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then: "I've heard of this stone lately,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I think, or one like it.

Come on, let's find out what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wyatt followed him into the labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory and saw him insert the shiny pellet</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a receptacle that was part of a pon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derous electrical mechanism. Dazzling</seg><seg type="columnLine">light bathed the stone at Carr's touch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a switch, and his instrument purred</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly from some force from within.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Microscope!" scoffed Wyatt. "That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">no microscope."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carr laughed. He was peering through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a double eye-piece, making mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjustments as he replied, "Not exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a microscope, no. It's a device utilizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio waves which bore right into an</seg><seg type="columnLine">object.

Wyatt was startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the intensity of his friend's exclama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and the sudden rigidity of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched body as those long fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightened on the control knobs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why-y-" Carr snapped his lean</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">form erect, his face white, gazed incred-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then it was as if a writhing, liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing substance flicked out of the recep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacle which held the cat's-eye and</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashed against Carr's temple, clinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">there a moment like a dab of quivering</seg><seg type="columnLine">jelly and then vanished in a puff of light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wyatt blinked as he would before a</seg><seg type="columnLine">photographer's flash lamp.

The scientist</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeled jerkily toward his apparatus and</seg><seg type="columnLine">switched off the power with a hand that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved stiffly as if unwilling to do his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bidding. As the purr of the mechanism</seg><seg type="columnLine">died down, he slumped into a chair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat swaying weakly.

The very touch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it gave him a chill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still Carr was unable to speak, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purple blotch was growing larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly.

He knew that Emory had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">place in Riverdale a spooky old house</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was hidden from the road by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangle of unkempt shrubbery.

A shout greet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed his words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have the stone then!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wyatt snapped: "Yes, but what about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carr?

Shall I take him to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospital ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no!" Emory's voice was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">panicky in the receiver. "Keep your</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt on, young fellow. He'll be all right;</seg><seg type="columnLine">just bundle him into a cab and bring him</seg><seg type="columnLine">up here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although this was far from reassuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Wyatt, Carr nodded when he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether he was agreeable to the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posal. After that it was the work of</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a minute to get the afflicted scientist</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the street and ensconced in a taxi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cab.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ride up Riverside Drive and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the city limits was a nightmare.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carr made ghastly, inhuman noises in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his throat and his body was attacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a series of violent twitchings like</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of a man in an epileptic fit. Sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral times Wyatt was tempted to stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cab and call for an ambulance, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">each time the scientist was able to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">his objection understood by unintelligible</seg><seg type="columnLine">croakings and agitated jerkings of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. The hideous purple now covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his entire face and the sunken eyes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">swollen completely shut. He was in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitiable state and Wyatt raged inwardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he saw the driver's grin reflected in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear-view mirror. Although it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only natural that the fellow should think</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carr was drunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eventually they reached the dilapi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dated old mansion where Emory made</seg><seg type="columnLine">his headquarters on the rare occasions</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he was in America. An air of</seg><seg type="columnLine">decrepitude and decay hung about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient frame structure; its tumble-down</seg><seg type="columnLine">gables and crazily askew shutters pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed grossest neglect. Yet the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plorer-scientist was reputed to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealthy man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time Carr had lapsed into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">semi-conscious condition and Wyatt had</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable difficulty in getting him up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rickety steps to the porch after dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charging the over-inquisitive taxi man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His temper was none too good as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">called out loudly for Emory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The explorer appeared at the door in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shirt sleeves, a stocky, middle-aged</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with a fiery red beard that bristled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with intolerance and arrogance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said: "Ha!--stout fellow. Bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">him right in. But where's the stone?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"OTONE!" exploded Wyatt. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ just forget that now and give me</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lift with Carr.

When they had the suffering sci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">entist stretched on a divan, Emory com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounded a potion from several colorless</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquids and poured it down his throat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carr's body relaxed immediately and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell into a natural sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The explorer's gaze measured Wyatt</seg><seg type="columnLine">contemplatively. "I've seen you some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where before this?" he inquired blandly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, oncc or twice. Union League</seg><seg type="columnLine">Club." Wyatt jerked his thumb in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carr's direction. "How about my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend?" he asked shortly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Emory glowered.

The explorer's bushy red</seg><seg type="columnLine">brows drew together in anger, then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got control of himself. "There's a check</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a thousand in it," he reminded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wyatt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It can wait." For a moment Wyatt</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought Emory would spring at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat and a feeling of exultation</seg><seg type="columnLine">surged up within him. In the mood</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had come over him he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have welcomed the encounter. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the thick biceps relax under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's shirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well," said the explorer with</seg><seg type="columnLine">obviously feigned . indifference. "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave you to watch over your friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who, by the way, is a friend of mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well. I have other things to do."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He strode out of the rom without</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much as a backward glance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HEN half an hour had passed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wyatt saw with relief Carr's nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal healthy color was returning. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">swelling of his eyes had abated and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing was easy and regular. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident that he would soon recover.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thinking the matter over more calmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, Wyatt regretted his antagonizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Emory. He would have preferred</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking with the man about the mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious stone that was in his pocket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the queer missile which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken Carr. Without doubt there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a connection between it and the cat's-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye; there was some secret known to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emory and which Carr had glimpsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the depths of the weird stone when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had it in the radio microscope. More</seg><seg type="columnLine">than one questionable happening had fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed that stone . . . the panhandler's</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession of it and his strange death</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the street . . . the two thugs who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped the police . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wyatt walked out into the hall, fin-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gering the cat's-eye in his pocket. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was icy-cold to his touch and he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">linquished it with a new shiver of dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taste. He could not have explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">why he had not flung the thing away</seg><seg type="columnLine">long before this. Suddenly finding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air close and fetid inside, he ambled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the porch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A soft voice hailed him from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrubbery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He caught a glimpse of a small round</seg><seg type="columnLine">face with frightened eyes under a wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blown mass of golden hair, then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision was obscured by the dense leaf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age. He plunged into the shrubbery on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A girl, whose like he had never seen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only in a garment of some shimmering</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff that scarcely hid the outlines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her superb figure, she was like a wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature of an alien jungle. Obviously</seg><seg type="columnLine">of another race, small in stature and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with skin like old ivory, birdlike in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">poise, she seemed about to run off</seg><seg type="columnLine">through ,the underbrush like a startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">fawn. Her eyes, wide and clear, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the deepest violet. Not blue; violet</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and flecked with glints of gold. Wy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">att's heart skipped a beat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Please," she said in agitated tones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"please to make way with the stone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To the old man I give it, that he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispose of it before the time is too late.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now you have returned it here. Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ask of you, please to destroy it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was tragic earnestness in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plea--nameless fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why?" stammered Wyatt. "How</seg><seg type="columnLine">did you know I had it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I know.

It was Carr, his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrant with suppressed excitement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl slipped off into the tangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrubbery and was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment Wyatt stood speech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, hardly believing he had seen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">CAT'S EYE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">17</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">heard aright. Then, awakening to real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity, he answered his friend's call. "Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing," he sang out.

Wyatt</seg><seg type="columnLine">was amazed at the enthusiasm of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two scientists as they fingered the cat's-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye and discussed subjects that seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely foreign to the thing they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">examining.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They talked of the fourth and fifth</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensions, of the possibility of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects occupying the same space at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time due to difference in the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitution of matter and the reversal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of electronic revolutions, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the existence of a world within a world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of planes of vibration. They spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unseen realms and the nearness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures that existed but were not per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived by the senses, and then they</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed the cat's-eye in a clamp that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">between two huge spheres of a compli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated electrical mechanism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wyatt heard what they said dimly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but it made little impression on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness. He was thinking of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl in the shrubbery and of her ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vious fear. Of her strange beauty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Carr seemed as excited as Emory;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he talked incessantly, ignoring Wyatt in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his intense interest in the answers given</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his questions by the explorer. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">both scientists fell silent as the rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">whine of a generator somewhere in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house resounded through the laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wyatt looked at the cat's-eye where</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was held in the clamp. It seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that the thing glimmered suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a new and unholy light, that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinked knowingly and evilly as if set</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the head of a cunning and vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">feline.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then a small figure dashed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room and flung herself toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">now humming mechanism. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden-haired girl of the bushes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Emory shouted angrily, "Ayra!" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed in to intercept her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her objective was not long in doubt;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was the glittering stone which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed of such importance to so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. She hurled her body between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two spheres of the machine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched at the cat's-eye with trembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers. It was held fast by the clamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she tugged desperately to wrench</seg><seg type="columnLine">it free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Ayra!" Emory shouted again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time his voice was a throaty bellow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He grasped the girl's arm, but she tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">it free of his grip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carr stood watching as if stupefied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Emory shook the girl violently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">growling and cursing. She resisted him</seg><seg type="columnLine">valiantly, her eyes ablaze with fury. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">explorer struck her resoundingly with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flat of his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">That was too much for Wyatt. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">one stride he reached Emory and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yanked him away, whirled him around.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The explorer was quick and was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">18</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful man; he drove a massive fist</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Wyatt's mid-section, momentarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">winding him. Recovering, Wyatt drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a right that snapped the man's head</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and rocked him to his heels, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed with a left that started from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor and caught the whiskered chin</seg><seg type="columnLine">at precisely the correct angle. The ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plorer crashed in the midst of his ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus and lay still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl, Avra, had paid no atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, but was still trying to work the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat's-eye free of its clamp.

There came a sudden spiteful</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirr of the machine and a blinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash. Clinging fast to the girl, Wyatt</seg><seg type="columnLine">was buffeted by a force which permeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">every fibre of his being and racked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with insupportable tortures. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a warping of the very universe about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, a cataclysmic upheaval that flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into a fathomless abyss of blackness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew no more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Other World</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CONSCIOUSNESS returned ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruptly and painlessly. Wyatt</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay for a moment collecting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses. Overhead was a high dome; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room in which he found himself was</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular in shape, windowless, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls of an unfamiliar bluish white</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal. Beneath his sprawled body the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor was cold and hard, but on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast reposed a soft burden. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl Ayra.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved her head to his knee as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sat erect. Long lashes fluttered on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ivory of her cheeks, then they raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">and those gold-flecked violet eyes looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up into his own. Terror came into them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the instant and the girl leaped to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her glance darted in all directions like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of a trapped animal. Then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathed a sigh of relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For us it is most fortunate," she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"None of them is here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who?" asked Wyatt, staring stupidly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw then for the first time a pedestal</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rose from the floor at his side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rising, he saw that it held at its tip a</seg><seg type="columnLine">replica of the cat's-eye which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cause of so much commotion. Dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gusted, he growled: "Another of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blamed things, so help me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is the same stone," the girl averred,</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarding it with new fear in her gaze.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But this time she made no attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remove it from its mounting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A derisive comment was on the tip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wyatt's tongue.

But the words did not come ;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not find it in him to ridicule</seg><seg type="columnLine">this girl who was so obviously in earnest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so greatly agitated. Even now she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was tugging at his sleeve, her parted lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremulous, her gaze beseeching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She whispered: "No time there is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be lost if we are to preserve our lives.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come; Ayra show the way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing loth, for the silence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place and the blinking of the cat's-eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him the creeps, Wyatt followed her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was amazed to see a section of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemingly solid metal wall slide away at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wave of Ayra's tiny hand, disclosing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to view a long downward-sloping tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was lighted by a dim rosy glow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like the circular room, this passage was</seg><seg type="columnLine">walled with smooth metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where in time are we ?" he asked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl as they entered the passage and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door closed silently behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"In Idilna -- my home. But please</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hurry; the Keepers of the Stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">may return and find us." Ayra grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand and urged him onward as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped through the tunnel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CAT'S EYE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">19</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But-" Wyatt started to object.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hush, no sound must be made." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl increased her speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was nothing to do but follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">in silence. It was utterly weird and im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible, the thing which had happened--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that by some mechanical or electrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">means he and the girl had been trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported to this strange place. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">named the place, called it her home.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where was it? How had they arrived?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who was Ayra anyway? And what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cat's-eye--the two cat's-eyes--to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all this? Wyatt could only wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the answers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They left the main passage and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered one which was unlighted. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air was bad and the footing insecure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Ayra moved with the assurance born</seg><seg type="columnLine">of long familiarity with the way. Wyatt</seg><seg type="columnLine">clung to the soft warm hand within his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own, stumbling along blindly. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time he had ever depended so</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely on a woman. And what a wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man! The fragrance of her hair was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his nostrils. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were other dark passages--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">maze of them. Endless wandering, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed. And then they halted at a blank</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. Wyatt heard the click of a latch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a door swung outward. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the open air, on a ledge that projected</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the sheer wall of a cliff, hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of feet above the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AN amazing scene was before them,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•	an arid and desolate valley with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rugged mountain peaks in the distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no sign of human habitation in</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence. The sky was leaden and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge blood-red sun hung motionless at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horizon. Dust-clouds filled the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a choking, powdery dust that held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">odor of dissolution and decay. As Wyatt</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared, a raucous shriek came out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skies and a great gaunt creature winged</seg><seg type="columnLine">its way from the cliff and swooped down</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the valley. From wing tip to wing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tip it must have measured twenty feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A pteranodon !*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wyatt turned inquiring eyes to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is Idilna," she explained simply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But where is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know not." Ayra seemed lost in</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought for a moment, but was quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself again. "Please to come at once,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she begged. "From Ayrad, my father,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will learn more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They moved along the ledge to a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond door which opened into the rock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beyond this there was an apartment</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose windows -- narrow slits cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a three-foot wall of stone--</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked out over the barren valley. Ayra</seg><seg type="columnLine">called out in a strange tongue and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a catch in her ordinarily mellow voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An undersized but stalwart old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in from an adjoining room, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face alight at seeing the girl. But, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes rested on Wyatt, he stiffened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scowled darkly. A blur of harsh</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibilants fell from his tongue and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced threateningly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ayra shook her golden head in nega-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, silencing the old man with words</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his own speech, which, though im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periously delivered, held none of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">harshness that had marked his enuncia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. With not too good grace he moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her side and pressed his cheek to hers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a barbaric sort of greeting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My father," smiled Ayra in Wyatt's</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction. "That you were another stran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger like Emory was his thought. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">slay you was his wish, but I have per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suaded him otherwise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perceiving that Ayrad's manner was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still sullen, Wyatt wras not so sure she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been successful. But he returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a nod the deep bow of the old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and squatted before him on a mat pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided by the girl. These people had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">* A genus of pterodactyls, long extinct flying reptiles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its name indicates that it had no teeth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">20</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly quaint and primitive customs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ayrad spoke then in English, address-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his guest: "It is to me certain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you come from the land of Emree.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What do you here in the company of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my daughter ?" His words were snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out jerkily and his mien was haughty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl drew in her breath sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she saw Wyatt stiffen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps your daughter can answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">that better than I," he said curtly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ayra did answer, in a rush of breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less English that was as much addressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Wyatt as to her father: "Of Emory's</seg><seg type="columnLine">land is he, assuredly, but not of Emory's</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind. Innocently he returned the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Emory after I had thought to lose it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But of Emory's plans he knows nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all. Besides this, my father, he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">here unknowingly and without willing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. An accident it was, caused when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to protect me from the wrath of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fiery whiskered one. Please to know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">oh Ayrad, that this man is good--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man raised a hand, silencing</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. His manner softened as he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Wyatt. "I was mistaken in</seg><seg type="columnLine">you," he apologized.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A thousand questions raced through</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wyatt's mind, but he voiced none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Ayra had dropped her head on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her last words and he was staring at its</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumbled crown of gold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As if in answer to Wyatt's unspoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts, Ayrad commenced a long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">winded explanation which soon had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">guest's attention. The cat's-eye on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedestal in that metal-walled circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">room was, it seemed, an object of wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship to Ay rad's people. It was sacred,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as were its Keepers, of which Ayrad had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been one until recently. Sacred indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for did it not mirror another world</seg><seg type="columnLine">where godlike beings dwelt? Beings who</seg><seg type="columnLine">resided in comfort and luxury, who rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavens in great winged machines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own contriving, who had command</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of forces long lost to the knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Idilnians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Emree had come to them from</seg><seg type="columnLine">this other world and they had at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked upon him as a god. He had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained with them for a year, in Ay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rad's household. That was how father</seg><seg type="columnLine">and daughter had learned the language.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Emree had betrayed them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought about their present exile. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were two races in Idilna, warring races,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this Emree, whom they load thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">a god, had aligned himself with the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">emies of Ayrad's people and planned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">theft of a huge treasure from the Tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple of the Stone. The plot discovered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ayrad and Ayra were in disrepute, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives forfeit. And so they had hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves in this place. Emree, escap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to his own world, had been followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by two of the emperor's guards who</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought his life as well as the stone that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in his possession. Ayra followed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an attempt to destroy Emree's stone and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by sacrificing herself, clearing her father</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the suspicion which had come upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Incidentally, by making away with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emree's stone, would she not prevent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">return of the red-whiskered one, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be planning to come with rein-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forcements ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WYATT listened in amazement to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man's dissertation. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his own questions had been answered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not all. There was yet much about</seg><seg type="columnLine">this business which was incomprehen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is the gateway between the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">worlds, the cat's-eye," Ayrad went on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Through it, this Emree pass from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to other, using the force we Keepers</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew nothing of. In both worlds exist</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stone and in either the force is ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fective."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All very confusing to an automobile</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealer.

The old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged helplessly. "But one thing we</seg><seg type="columnLine">know--it is not like your world, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead world. Our sun stand still in sky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our heat gradually leave us.

He scratched his chin un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly, thinking of some of the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plorer's talk with Carr back there in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory. Of their enthusiasm over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fourth and fifth dimensions and or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bital revolutions of electrons, whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">these might portend. Of one realm ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isting at the same time and in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">space as another. It was all too fantastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unreal, yet here he sat. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came an insistent banging at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outer door. Ayra paled, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">father rose to his feet, drawing a curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous pistol-like weapon from the folds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tunic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALMOST immediately the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed in and four husky guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in the room. Ayrad's weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">twanged and a writhing shaft of milky</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance darted to the breast of one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intruders. Memory came to Wyatt</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the thing which had stricken Carr</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, but here the effect was different.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The milky- substance congealed instantly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">covering its victim with a quivering mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of jelly that brought him to the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a squirming, helpless mound. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible, that jelly, living protoplasm</seg><seg type="columnLine">which absorbed swiftly the human food</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was within its folds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another of the weird weapons twanged</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ayrad was down. Ayra screamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rushed upon the guard who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired, beating at his face with ineffectual</seg><seg type="columnLine">little fists. Wyatt, who had been stunned</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the suddenness and deadliness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, went into action, his long arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">flailing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These men were of similar mold to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ayrad--short, stocky fellows with bulg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing muscles and massive shoulders. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">they knew nothing of the art of boxing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were completely taken by surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Wyatt rushed them. The first went</seg><seg type="columnLine">off his feet and crashed in a corner un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the impetus of a hard-driven fist</seg><seg type="columnLine">which made a sound like a breaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">board, when it struck his jaw. The sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond fired his pistol, but Wyatt had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist in a grip that spoiled his aim.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Milky protoplasm splashed the ceiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dripped stickily, nastily. Having no</seg><seg type="columnLine">organic substance on which to feed, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">became inert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Wyatt had his hands full with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. Ayra's cries were in his ears, driv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him frantic, distracting him. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guard had wround legs and arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him in such a manner that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could neither use his fists nor wrench</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself free. He resorted to an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">trick, relaxing suddenly and slumping in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fellow's arms as if yielding. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">that moment his antagonist was off guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and off balance, releasing his crushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip for just the moment Wyatt needed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pistol changed hands swiftly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came down with a crunch on the guard's</seg><seg type="columnLine">skull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The one, who struggled with Ayra,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelled when he saw his only remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally fall, released her and turned to flee.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wyatt shot him down without compunc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, albeit he shuddered at the avidity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ghastly living shroud that envel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oped him so speedily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ayra, bruised and sobbing, was glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Wyatt's supporting arm. Gently he</seg><seg type="columnLine">22</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">drew her from the room of sudden and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholesale slaughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Emory's Return</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN an adjoining chamber, Wyatt wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed until the girl had regained a</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure of composure. Finally her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbing ceased and she looked up at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectantly. Not once had she spoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her father's passing, but those violet</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were eloquent of grief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do we get out of here?" Wyatt</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No way there is but through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Temple of the Stone." The girl's tone</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dubious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden thought came to Wyatt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How did you get to my world in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first place?" he inquired. If return were</seg><seg type="columnLine">now possible, it would be the easiest solu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of her difficulties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ayra brightened. "Unknown to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keepers, this Emory had put a machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the pedestal of the Stone. When ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cused by the emperor, Ayra revealed this</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, and thus it was his guards did</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow the red-whiskered one. Ayra es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caped after that and she, too, followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in such manner. If but the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">remains-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll gamble it does. Let's go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ayra's gaze dropped to her garment</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hot color flooded her cheeks. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was torn almost to shreds from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle with the guard, revealing start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling the ivory creaminess of her skin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I must change my robe," she fal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wyatt chuckled. "Make it snappy</seg><seg type="columnLine">then," he urged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After she had gone from the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">he strolled into the chamber of death</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had left. Only two bodies were</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, those of the guards he had fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his hands. Both had died instantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Of the others or of the jelly which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcome them there was no sign.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whether the devilish stuff had crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">away after feeding or whether it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself been consumed in the consuming</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its victims, he could only conjecture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sound rang through the apartment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crash of an overturned object in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some distant room. Genuinely alarmed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wyatt barged through the place, calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Ayra as he ran. There was no reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had thought that the door through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they had entered was the sole en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance to the hideaway, but certainly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl had not gone out that way, else he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have seen her. As certainly, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not in any of the rooms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cursing himself for a fool, Wyatt</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to the grudging conclusion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ayra had deceived him, that she had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberately left him to his own devices</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a place that would soon be swarming</seg><seg type="columnLine">with foes. But a more careful search</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the place unearthed evidence to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrary. In a dark corner he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shred of clothing amidst the fragments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what had been a large urn. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a struggle then. Another shred</seg><seg type="columnLine">of filmy material apparently embedded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall at a point waist-high from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor indicated the existence of a secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">panel. There was another exit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wyatt felt carefully along the wall un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til his fingers encountered a spring. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">panel slid back noiselessly and he was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a passage like those through which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl had brought him here. Clutching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead guard's pistol, he felt his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously through the blackness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">His mind no longer seethed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubts and questionings. It did not mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter now where Idilna was located, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of a world he was in, nor how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had arrived. All that mattered was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ayra. Finding her and getting her out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this mess became his sole concern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once he thought he heard voices ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he increased his pace only to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">CAT'S EYE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">up against the dead end of a passage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He retraced his steps and went into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">branch passage where the going was</seg><seg type="columnLine">easier. This sloped upward and soon he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a dim light ahead. And then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in a lighted tunnel, one that he rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ognized. It was not far to the circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">room of the cat's-eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reaching the door at the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage, he pressed his ear to the smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal. The rumble of an angry voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from beyond--the voice of Lute</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emory!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A SWIFT search of the moulding dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the spring which released the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. It slid back, revealing a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">tableau in the circular room. Emory</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Carr stood by the pedestal which</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the stone, and facing them was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">much disheveled Ayra, who was between</seg><seg type="columnLine">two most hideous man-creatures. Emory</seg><seg type="columnLine">was berating the girl in no uncertain</seg><seg type="columnLine">terms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These beings who guarded Ayra were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in nowise similar to her father or to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guards Wyatt had seen before. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were tall and gaunt, red skinned, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">naked save for loin cloths of some glit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering woven stuff; their heads were</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous, totally bald, and globular in</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape. They had no ears, but, instead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">great round diaphragms set flush with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their skulls and stretched tight like drum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads. Almost transparent, these dia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phragms fluttered under the impact of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emory's voice waves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carr was watching in a dreamy sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of way, apparently unmoved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the big idea?" Wyatt de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded wrath fully, edging in between</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ayra and the explorer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Emory's face purpled; he seemed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the verge of apoplexy. But Carr nudged</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and the explosion that had been im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minent expended itself in a mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">splutter. "Ha!" he growled. "Hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected to see you yet, Wyatt. Hm!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But you keep your shirt on, young fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, and don't butt in on this until you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what it's all about. Carr here has</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown in with me and I'll have an offer</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you presently. In the meanwhile I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal with this hell-cat, Ayra, as I see</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wyatt restrained himself at what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought was a warning signal from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carr's gray eyes. "You'll not harm her,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he offered. Nevertheless he was puzzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the entire proceeding, surprised that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carr had cast his lot with Emory in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal so obviously shady. Or had he?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, she'll not be harmed," the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plorer rumbled. "Only kept under re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">straint during the revolution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Revolution! Wyatt realized then that</seg><seg type="columnLine">these gibbous-headed monsters with Ay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ra were of the Lukha, enemies of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">people and the allies of Emory in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">plottings. Sounds of strife came faintly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the metal walls, and he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">now why he had seen none of the Keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers of the Stone.	4</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He lie," the girl averred stoutly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well he knows the Lukha will slay</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ayra so soon as he departs with what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came for."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll release her, Emory," said Wy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">att grimly. "I'll look out for her, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">these skinny apes, so help me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The explorer laughed raucously. "So</seg><seg type="columnLine">you fell for the little trollop," he sneered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wyatt saw red and his long arm shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">out like- a flash. But this time Emory</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat a swift retreat, dodging behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedestal. In a fury he bellowed: "I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">had enough of your interference. Take</seg><seg type="columnLine">him away, Lukha--take the girl, too!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ayra cried out in fear or in pain, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not tell which, but it was enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to goad Wyatt into a wild lunge over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedestal. Carr's attempt to restrain him</seg><seg type="columnLine">went unnoticed. But vicious triumph</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in Emory's leer and Wyatt never</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached him, for he was halted midway</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his rush by a pair of wiry arms which</seg><seg type="columnLine">24</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">encircled him and pinned his own arras</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was in the grip of one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lukha and it was impossible to squirm</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of that steel-muscled embrace. Oth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers of the red men came from nowhere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeming to spring up from the very floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was carried, kicking and strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling vainly and ignominiously, carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">one moment and dragged the next, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til the circular room was left behind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sound of Emory's laughter died out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eventually, bruised and sore, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dumped into a narrow ccll and the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">clanged shut behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'OUEFULLY, Wyatt surveyed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">surroundings. The air was stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nant in this place, and the floor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ankle deep with indescribable filth. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">sole article of furniture was a long metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">bench which must serve as seat or couch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The grilled door was securely locked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only light came through a four-inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">slit in the metal wall, a slit that rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the level of his shoulders to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling some three feet above. Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">this opening filtered the din of combat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wyatt moved to the opening and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sniffed the outside air, finding it but little</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than that in his prison. But from</seg><seg type="columnLine">this place he had a restricted view of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was evidently a public square, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad plaza with a tall monument in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">center and flanked by conical buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose lustrous metallic walls reflected</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dull red of the motionless sun in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sombre and eery shades. Patches of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light at the tips of the cones made of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them huge poniards whose points had</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn human blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And human blood was being spilled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the square below. Hundreds of Lukha</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarmed over the area and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">battling the shorter and stockier Idil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nians with wicked curved blades which</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose and fell with deadly accuracy. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">defenders, outnumbered many times,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought valiantly and occasionally vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toriously. But quarters were too close</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their own forces too disorganized</seg><seg type="columnLine">for effective use of their protoplasm pis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tols. There could be but one outcome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fuming helplessly, Wyatt left the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erture and hunched his aching body on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bench. One thing was sure--Carr</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not in this thing with Emory, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">as an ally. He had come to this night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marish place with the explorer under</seg><seg type="columnLine">that pretext, but actually because he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kind who would never desert a friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was in difficulties. Wyatt knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carr of old; even now that fertile brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his had probably concocted some</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme to get them out of this. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the getting out was likely to be a slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dangerous process, for Carr's scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific bent was sure to keep him on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene as long as new discoveries were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Piecing together the bits of informa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion given him by Ayra and her father,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wyatt could only conclude that Emory</seg><seg type="columnLine">had carefully organized this raid of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lukha and timed his return to coincide</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it. That was why he had been so</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to get his hands on the cat's-eye,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it was still not at all clear to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wyatt how the weird stone fitted into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the picture. If there was a treasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emory expected to get for himself, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would make sure that no one else</seg><seg type="columnLine">shared it. His promises to the Lukha</seg><seg type="columnLine">would mean nothing; he would find some</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of double-crossing them. Quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely he planned to double-cross Carr</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As for Ayra--Wyatt's throat con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricted when he thought of her. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not the least idea what they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done or would do with her, and certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no help for her to be obtained</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Emory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wyatt's hand encountered a hard ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject in his pocket. It was the pistol he</seg><seg type="columnLine">CAT'S EYE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">25</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken from the guard; luckily the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lukha had not frisked him. He exam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ined it curiously and found it to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple enough arm, operating by com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed air and containing eight gray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish-white pellets in its magazine. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the missiles which released the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly protoplasm. He replaced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon in his pocket gingerly; it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be that it would come in handy later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden increase in the din outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut short his reflections and brought him</seg><seg type="columnLine">again to the narrow window. The fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out there had ended and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpse-strewn plaza not one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-skinned men of Idilna remained on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet. Only the hideous big-heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">were left, and these formed a howling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">milling, triumphant mob. In their midst</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Emory, grinning evilly and shouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">approbation. Carr was not with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wyatt's stomach went suddenly hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he returned to his bench.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">F)SST!" The sound was barely au-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dible but was repeated, more loudly</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time: "Psst!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wyatt raised his head and looked di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly into the smiling gray eyes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Addison Carr, who stood on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the grilled door. A key rattled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dog-gone!" exulted Wyatt. "I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd be here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hanged if I thought I would. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do for the fellow with the keys and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was a tough customer." Carr had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door open now, and Wyatt saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was bleeding freely from half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen gashes about the head and arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Emory's completely nuts," he grunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And then some; I saw him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">square."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carr glanced at the narrow window'.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"An odd thing, that," he drawled.

Efforts to communicate with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Idilnians were of no avail, as there</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be none among them who un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstood his words.

The tall buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lower and midtown Manhattan passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in review, the ships of the harbor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, a great dirigible soaring high over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Palisades.

Emory cursed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">raved like a madman.

Excruciating agonies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran through his veins as if his blood had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to molten metal; a red film blotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his vision; his muscles refused to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do his bidding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> E&gt;imly he heard Carr's shout of anger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the ensumg scuffle.

He saw that fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers of the Lukha were crowding</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the room, that a furious fight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">raging. The red-robed ones fought with</seg><seg type="columnLine">short swords they had drawn from under</seg><seg type="columnLine">their draperies, the Lukha with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wicked curved knives he had seen them</seg><seg type="columnLine">use in the square.

But his followers were so inextri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cably mixed in with the attackers that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was impossible for the time to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinguish friend from foe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FINDING his strength returning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wyatt drew himself up on one elbow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then to his knees.

Sorry-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A dying Keeper staggered against him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the two went down in a heap. Wyatt</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered what Ayra had said about</seg><seg type="columnLine">that generator and he struggled to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, pulling Carr with him. He still had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pistol. Gubbing it, he struck down</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Keeper who swung at them with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw before him a robed one whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">face seemed familiar; it was the one he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had halted by the cell and spoken to of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ayra. The girl was with him. Whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">with friendly or malicious intent, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keeper had sought her out and brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to this place of death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wyatt went cold with horror.

Wyatt battered in a bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bous head which came up before him</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a blade that never completed its</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc, and fought his way to her side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was arguing in her own tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the chief Keeper but his compressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips and unyielding countenance showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had no thought of giving in to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever it was she was requesting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment a group of Lukha</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed the pedestal and the chief Keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er was swiftly victim to the vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust of a curved blade which passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely through his body. Wyatt brained</seg><seg type="columnLine">his assailant with the butt of his pis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tol, drawing Ayra into the protection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his left arm as he swung at the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his right. The robed one who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought her leaped into the fray with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeping short sword, decapitating two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Lukha before he was slain. Wy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">att snatched up a dripping curved blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the floor and wielded it to good</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a nightmare, this struggle in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room of the Stone. The shaft of</seg><seg type="columnLine">orange light still struck down from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome and the cat's-eye, bathed in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminescence, wras a living, gloating thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching the carnage, seeming to wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an opportunity of sits own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carr had managed to reach the ped-</seg><seg type="columnLine">estal and was working ,swiftly through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a door which he found in its base.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thrusting the girl behind him, Wyatt</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept his blade whistling in a sweeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc which held back the nearest of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">attackers.

The hubbub of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting was lulled as the orange light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft from above flashed out with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunderous roar.

Baxter, in the quarters of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American, was in doubt as to the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">profitable course to pursue.

No thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mercy for the men of the pirate ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">could enter their minds. The outlaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">had each been given a chance to sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">render, and each had refused it. Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusing, they knew, as the Triplanetarians</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew and as all modern readers know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant that they were staking their lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon victory. For with modern arma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments it is seldom indeed that a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">man lives through the defeat in battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a war-vessel of space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Roger launched his field of red opac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity, but it did not reach even "Boise's"</seg><seg type="columnLine">screens.

Ultra-violet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">infra-red, pure heat, infra-sound, solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">beams of high-tension high-frequency</seg><seg type="columnLine">current in whose paths the most stub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">born metals would be volatilized instant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly ; all iron-driven, every deadly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">torturing vibration known was hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">against that screen; but it, too, was iron-</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven, and it held. Even the awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of the macrobeam was dissipated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by it--reflected, hurled away on all sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">in coruscating torrents of blinding, dazz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling energy. Cooper, Adlington, Spen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cer, and Dutton hurled against it their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombs and torpedoes--and still it held.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Roger's fiercest blasts and heaviest</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectiles were equally impotent against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the force-s'nields of the super-ship. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">adept, having no liking for a battle upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything like equal terms, sought safety</seg><seg type="columnLine">in flight, only to be brought to a crash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, stunning halt by a massive tractor</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That must be that sixth-phase poly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cyclic screen that Conway reported on,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cleveland frowned in thought.

Then, failing in that as he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would fail, he demanded something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do.

See you later!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Nevian physician directed his key-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube upon the transparent wall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber and an opening appeared, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening which vanished as soon as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stepped through it; Costigan kicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">a valve open; and from various innocent</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes there belched forth into the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the central lagoon and into the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">over it a flood of deadly vapor. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevian turned toward the prisoner there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an almost inaudible hiss and a tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">jet of the frightful, outlawed stuff struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">his open gills, just below his huge, coni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal head. He tensed momentarily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twitched convulsively just once, and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless to the floor. And outside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the streams of avidly soluble liquefied</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas rushed out into air and into water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It spread, dissolved, and diffused with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the extreme mobility which is one of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">characteristics; and as it diffused and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">borne outward the Nevians, in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">massed hundreds, died. Died not know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing what killed them; not knowing even</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they died. Costigan, bitterly resent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful of the inhuman treatment accorded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three and fiercely anxious for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">success of his plan of escape, held his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath and, grimly alert, watched the am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phibians die. When he could see no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion anywhere he donned his gas-mask,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strapped upon his back a large canister</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the poison--his capacious pockets were</seg><seg type="columnLine">already full of smaller containers--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">two savagely exultant sentences escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am a poor, ignorant specimen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ape, that can be let play with apparatus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">am I?" he rasped, as he picked up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">keytube of the specialist and opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of his prison. "Maybe they'll learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometime that it ain't always safe to</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge by the looks of a flea how far he</seg><seg type="columnLine">can jump!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stepped out through the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the water, and, burdened as he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made shift to swim to the nearest ramp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Up it he ran, toward a main corridor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But ahead of him there was wafted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath of dread Vee-Two, and where that</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath went, went also unconsciousness</seg><seg type="columnLine">--an unconsciousness which would deep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">en gradually into permanent oblivion save</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the prompt intervention of one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed, not only the necessary anti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dote, but the equally important knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of exactly how to use it. Upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor of that corridor were strewn</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevians, who had dropped in their tracks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Past or over their bodies Costigan strode,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pausing only to direct a jet of lethal</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapor into whatever branching corridor</seg><seg type="columnLine">or open doorway caught his eye. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to the intake of the city's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventilation plant, and no unmasked crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture dependent for life upon oxygen could</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar his path. He reached the intake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore the canister from his back, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leased its full, vast volume of horrid</seg><seg type="columnLine">contents into the primary air stream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND all throughout that doomed city</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevians dropped; quietly and with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a struggle, unknowing. Busy execu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tives dropped upon their cushioned, fiat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">topped desks; hurrying travelers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">messengers dropped upon the floors of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corridors or relaxed in the noxious</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters of the ways; lookouts and ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servers dropped before their flashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">screens; central operators of communica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions dropped under the winking lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their panels. Observers and centrals</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the outlying sections of the city won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered briefly at the unwonted universal</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionlessness and stagnation; then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">racing taint in water and in air reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, too, and they ceased wondering--</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then through those quiet halls Costi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan stalked to a certain storage room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where with all due precaution he donned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own suit of Triplanetary armor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Making an ungainly bundle of the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">Solarian equipment stored there, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged it along behind him as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">clanked back toward his prison, until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">neared the dock at which was moored</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Nevian space-speedster which he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined to take. Here, he knew, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first of many critical points. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew of the vessel was aboard, and, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its independent air-supply, unharmed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had weapons, were undoubtedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarmed, and were very probably highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicious. They, too, had ultra-beams</seg><seg type="columnLine">and might see him, but his very closeness</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them would tend to protect him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultra-beam observation Therefore he</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched tensely behind a buttress, star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through his spy-ray goggles, waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment when none of the Nevians</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be near the entrance, but grimly</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolved to act instantly should he feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">any touch of a spying ultra-beam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's where the pinch comes," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled to himself.

Costigan trained his key-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube upon the doorway of Clio's cell, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed it aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Different combinations over here!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">barked.

Up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a series of ramps they took the still form,</seg><seg type="columnLine">placing it finally upon a soft couch in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an enormous and heavily guarded central</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall. Costigan turned to his companion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clio, and even through the helmets she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see plainly the white agony of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression.

All right--start</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The speedster had come to a halt di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly over the imposing edifice within</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> which Bradley was incarcerated, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty beam had flared downward, dig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging a fiery well through floor after floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stubborn metal. The ceiling of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">amphitheater pierced, the beam expired;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down into that assembly hall there</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped two canisters of Vee-Two; to</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash and to fill its atmosphere with im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceptible death.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind that single line of armored guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">were massed perhaps twenty unarmored,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but masked, soldiers; and scuttling up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ramps leading into the hall were com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the platoons of heavily-armored</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures which Costigan had previously</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Decision instantly made, Costigan ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">back toward the speedster, but he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not deserting his companions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep the good work up!" he instruct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed the girl as he ran. "I'll pick those</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaspers off with a pencil ray and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand off the bunch that's coming while</seg><seg type="columnLine">you rub out the rest of that crew there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drag Bradley back here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BACK at the control panel, he trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">a narrow, but intensely dense pencil</seg><seg type="columnLine">of livid flame, and one by one the six</seg><seg type="columnLine">armored figures fell. Then, knowing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clio could handle the remaining opposi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, he devoted his attention to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reenforcements so rapidly approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the sides. Again and again the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy beam lashed out, now upon this</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, now upon that, and in its flaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">path Nevians disappeared. And not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevians--in the incrcdible energy of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam's blast, floor, walls, ramps, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">every material thing vanished in clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thick and brilliant vapor. The room</seg><seg type="columnLine">temporarily clear of foes, he sprang again</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Clio's assistance, but her task was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly done. She had "rubbed out" all</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposition and, tugging lustily at Brad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley's feet, had already dragged him al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most to the side of the speedster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " 'At-a-girl, Clio!" cheered Costigan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he picked up the burly captain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed him through the doorway. "High-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly useful, girl of my dreams, as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">ornamental. In with you, and we'll start</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to go places!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But getting the speedster out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nowr completely ruined hall proved to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">much more of a task than driving it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been, for scarcely had the Terres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trials closed their locks than a section of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the building collapsed behind them, cut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting off their retreat. Nevian submarines</seg><seg type="columnLine">and airships were beginning to arrive</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the scene, and were raying the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing viciously in an attempt to entrap or</seg><seg type="columnLine">to crush the Terrestrials in its ruins.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Costigan managed finally to Kast his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, but the Nevians had had time to as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">semble in force and he was met by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrated storm of beams and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal from every inimical weapon within</seg><seg type="columnLine">range.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But not for nothing had Conway Cos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tigan selected for his dash for liberty the</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft which, save only for the two im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense interstellar cruisers, was the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful vessel ever built upon red</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevia. And not for nothing had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied minutely and to the last, least</seg><seg type="columnLine">detail every item of its controls and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its armament during wearily long days</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nights of solitary imprisonment. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had studied it under test, in action, .. .d</seg><seg type="columnLine">at rest; studied it until he knew thor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oughly its every possibility--and what a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship it was! The iron-driven generators</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his shielding screens handled with ease</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrific load of the Nevians' assault,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his polycyclic screens were proof against</seg><seg type="columnLine">any material projectile, and the machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplying his offensive beams with power</seg><seg type="columnLine">were more than equal to their tasks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Driven now at full rating those frightful</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons lashed out against the Nevian</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocking the way, and under their im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pacts her screens flared 'brilliantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the spectrum and went down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">TRIPLANETARY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And in the instant of their failure the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy vessel was literally blown into</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothingness--no unprotected metal, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever resistant, could exist for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the pathway of those iron-driven tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nadoes of pure energy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ship after ship of the Nevians plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the speedster in desperately sui-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cidal attempts to ram her down, but each</seg><seg type="columnLine">met the same flaming fate before its mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">could collide with the ship of the Ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">restrials. Then, from the grouped sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marines far below, there reached up red</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods of force, which seized the space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship and began relentlessly to draw her</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are they doing that for, Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way?

Upward now</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the highest permissible velocity the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedster leaped, and past the few ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">remaining above her she dodged; there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing now between her and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">freedom of boundless space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You did it, Conway; you did it!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clio exulted.

"The worst is yet to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come. Nerado. He's why they wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold us back, and why I was in such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hurry to get away.

Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">three simple squirts in the right places</seg><seg type="columnLine">will do the trick." He took from a locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment of his armor a small steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">box, which housed a surgeon's hypoder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mic and three vials. One, two, three,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he injected small, but precisely measured</seg><seg type="columnLine">amounts of the fluids into the three vital</seg><seg type="columnLine">localities, then placed the inert form upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deeply cushioned couch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There!

His hard young</seg><seg type="columnLine">face softened wonderfully as he stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her; there were two quick steps and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were in each other's arms.

Lips upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager lips, blue eyes to gray, motionless</seg><seg type="columnLine">they stood clasped in ecstasy; thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of the dreadful past, nothing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fearful future, conscious only of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glorious, the wonderful present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"/^•LIO mine .... darling .... girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">V-&gt;girl, how I love you!"

Their mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tual embrace tightened and her low voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrilled brokenly as she went on: "Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, dearest ....

Oh, Conway!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER a time Clio drew a long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremulous, but supremely happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath as the realities of their predica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment once more obtruded themselves upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">her consciousness. She released herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently from Costigan's arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you really think that there is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of us getting back to the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that we can be together .... always ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A chance, yes. A probability, no,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he replied, unequivocally. "It depends</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon two things. First, how much of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a start we got on Nerado. His ship is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the biggest and fastest thing I ever saw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if he strips her down and drives</seg><seg type="columnLine">her--which he will--he'll catch us long</seg><seg type="columnLine">before we can make Tellus. On the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">other hand, I gave Rodebush a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">data, and if he and Lyman Cleveland</seg><seg type="columnLine">can add it to their own stuff and get that</seg><seg type="columnLine">super-ship of ours rebuilt in time, they'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be out here on the prowl; and they'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have what can give even Nerado plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of argument. No use worrying about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, anyway. We won't know anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">until we can detect one or the other of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and then will be the time to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">something about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If Nerado catches us, will you . . . ."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rub you out? I will not. Even if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he does catch us, and takes us back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevia, I won't. There's lots more time</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming onto the clock. Nerado won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt either of us badly enough to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">scars, either physical, mental, or moral.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd kill you in a second if it were Roger;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's dirty and he's thoroughly bad. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nerado's a good enough old scout, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way. He's big and he's clean. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, I could really like that fish, if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could meet him on terms of equality</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometime ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I couldn't!" she declared, vigorously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's crawly and scaly and snaky; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he smells so .... so ... ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So rank and fishy?" Costigan laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply. "Details, girl; mere details.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we all had it to do, and neither side will</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame the other for doing it. He's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">square shooter, I tell you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">TRIPLANETARY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">51</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"TT TELL, maybe, but I don't like him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> V y a bit, and let's not talk about him</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more. Let's talk about us. Remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber what you said once, when you ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vised me to 'let you lay,' or whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was?" Woman-like, she wished to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dip again lightly into the waters of pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion, even though she had such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short time before led the man out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their profoundest depths. But Costigan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">into whose hard l?fe love of woman had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never before entered, had not yet recov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered sufficiently from his soul-shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunge to follow her lead. Inarticulate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">distrusting his newly found supreme hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piness, he must needs stay out of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">enchanted waters or plunge again. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was afraid to plunge--diffident, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeming himself unworthy of the mira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cle of this wonder-girl's love--even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though every fiber of his being shrieked</seg><seg type="columnLine">its demand to feel again that slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">body in his clasping arms. He did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciously think those thoughts. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">acted them without thinking; they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">inherent in His personality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do remember, and I still think it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sound idea, even though I am too far</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone now to let you put it into effect,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he assured her, half seriously. He kissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, tenderly and reverently, then studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">her carefully. "But you look as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd been on a Martian picnic. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">did you eat last?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't remember, exactly.

I thought so! Bradley and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can eat anything that's chewable, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink anything that will pour, but you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't. Ill scout around and see if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't fix up something that you'll be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to eat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rummaged through the store-rooms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerging with sundry viands from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he prepared a highly satisfactory meal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Think you can sleep now, sweet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart?" After supper, once more within</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the circle of Costigan's arms. Clio nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head against his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course I can, dear. Now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are with me, out here alone, I'm not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit afraid any more. You will get us</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the earth some way, sometime;</seg><seg type="columnLine">I just know that you will. Good-night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good-night, Clio .... little sweet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart," he whispered, and went back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bradley's side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In due time the captain recovered con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness, and slept. Then for days</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speedster flashed on toward our dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant solar system; days during which her</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide-flung detector screens remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know whether I'm afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'll hit something or afraid that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't," Costigan remarked more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, but finally those tenuous sentinels</seg><seg type="columnLine">did in fact encounter an interfering vi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bration. Along the detector line a visi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam sped, and Costigan's face hardened</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he saw the unmistakable outline of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nerado's interstellar cruiser, far behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, a stern chase always was a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">one," Costigan said finally. "He can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch us for plenty of days yet ... .</seg><seg type="columnLine">now what?" for the alarms of the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tectors had broken out anew. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still another point of interference to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigated.

While we're at it we</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to so pulverize that crowd that if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they never come near the Solarian sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem again they'll think it's twenty minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">too soon!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus it was that the "Boise," under</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a few dynes of propulsion, pursued</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Nevian ship. Apparently exerting</seg><seg type="columnLine">every effort, she never came quite within</seg><seg type="columnLine">range of the fleeing raider; yet never</seg><seg type="columnLine">was she so far behind that the Nevian</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-ship was not in clear register upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">her observation plates. Nor was Nerado</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone in strengthening his vessel. Costi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan knew well and respected highly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevian scientist-captain, and at his sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestion the entire time of the long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneventful flight was spent in reenforc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the super-ship's armament to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron-driven limit of theoretical and me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanical possibility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus, when Nevia and her hot, blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun appeared upon his plates Rodebush</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ready for any emergency, and hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his battleship upon the Nevian with every</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon aflame. But so was Nerado</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready; and, unlike her sister-ship, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel was manned by scientists well</seg><seg type="columnLine">versed in the fundamental theory of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons with which they fought. Beams,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods, and lances of energy flamed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flared; planes and pencils cut, slashed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stabbed; defensive screens glowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">redly or flashed suddenly into intensely</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant, coruscating incandescence. Crim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son opacity struggled sullenly against</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet curtain of annihilation. Material</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectiles and torpedoes were launched</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">under full beam control; only to be ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploded harmlessly in mid-space, to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">rayed into nothingness, or to disappear</seg><seg type="columnLine">innocuously against impenetrable poly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cyclic screens. Both vessels were equipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely with iron-driven mechanisms;</seg><seg type="columnLine">both were manned by scientists capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wringing the last possible watt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">power from their sources. They were ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proximately equal in size, and each now</seg><seg type="columnLine">wielded the theoretical ultimate of power</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her mass; therefore neither could</seg><seg type="columnLine">harm the other, furiously though each was</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying. And more and more nearly they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were approaching the red atmosphere of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world of the amphibians. Down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">that crimson blanket the two warring</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-ships dropped, down toward a city</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Costigan recognized as that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Nerado made his headquarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better hold off a bit," Costigan cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned. "If I know that bird at all, he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooking up something," and even as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke there shot upward from the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">a multitude of flashing balls. The Nev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ians had mastered the secret of the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosive of the fishes of the greater deeps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were launching it in a veritable storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the Terrestrial visitor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those?" asked Rodebush, calmly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The detonating balls of destruction were</seg><seg type="columnLine">literally annihilating even the atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the polycyclic screen, but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrier was scarcely affected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, that," pointing out a hemispher-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical dome which, redly translucent, sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded a group of buildings towering</seg><seg type="columnLine">high above their neighbors.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was (one sensed) fed up with wasting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his genius on unappreciative college stu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dents ; and he wanted money, much</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, a million dollars he said, to carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his experiments. But he made it</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear that he was honoring Olson Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">by allowing him to donate the money;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strangely enough--for Olson Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a plutocrat convinced of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight and importance--the magnate</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed. The personality of Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stringer--and this dried-up wizened little</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist in the middle fifties possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dynamic personality--carried all before</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Olson Smith turned over to him his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Long Island home, built workshops and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratories, and then left him to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seclusion and privacy he desired, taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his annual trip to the Bermudas. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one thing and another we did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">see Professor Stringer again until a</seg><seg type="columnLine">year later, when the yacht tied up at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">private pier of the Long Island estate</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we dined with him. Besides Olson</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith, Professor Stringer and myself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">three others were present that night, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle-aged business man named Glea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, ruddy of face from constant sham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pooing and good living, a noted sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geon who does not wish his name or</seg><seg type="columnLine">description given here, and Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bronson of the steam-yacht. Perhaps I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have failed to mention that Captain Bron-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son was a remarkably handsome man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere under forty, whose medium</seg><seg type="columnLine">height and slender figure belied the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical strength that was really his.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He certainly did not look the two-fisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighter, the dubious hero of shady ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ploits, that Olson Smith declared him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be. The multimillionaire was scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to make friends of his hired men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">be they valets or private secretaries, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">between himself and Bronson an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubted intimacy existed, based, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps, on the dual nature of the Captain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bronson was capable either of fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">or of discussing the merits of a Pulitzer</seg><seg type="columnLine">prize winner: a sort of Wolf Larsen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fellow, but more versatile and amen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able than Jack London's character.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was drink that night of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wines, liqueurs, and a very good brandy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all brought from the boat, but the Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor touched nothing. "A scientist</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have a clear head," he said, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">alcohol is not conducive to that--no--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he drank coffee, and when the ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vants had served it and left us alone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he began to talk, almost musingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Time," he said, "is the great enigma,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the phenomenon that captivates the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agination.

Nothing,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "nothing, save that it is related</seg><seg type="columnLine">to space." He paused and looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">us all half-dreamily.

He broke off and regarded us</seg><seg type="columnLine">more directly. "Really," he said, "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know as I am making this subject very</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear. But you must understand," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "that there are points, on which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am not very clear myself.

Not at first,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "My intentions were merely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">verify mathematically some further theo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ries, and to demonstrate. ..." He mused</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment. "But do you know the idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an actual Time Machine grew on</seg><seg type="columnLine">me?

Professor String-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er threw open the laboratory door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned on the lights.

With a quick movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no one anticipated he stepped for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and seated himself in the passenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat of the odd contrivance. I can see</seg><seg type="columnLine">him yet, his face flushed, his eyes bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant, his mop of dark hair disordered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All aboard for the future!" he shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">recklessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For heaven's sake, man!"

We picked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, unconscious, and for days he hov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered on the verge of death. The next</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning the business man went his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the city, ignorant of what had oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred. "Time machines," he chortled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"time machines," and smiled fatly. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of us settled down to wait for</seg><seg type="columnLine">we knew not what, and on the fifth day</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred the terrific explosion by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old stone wall, a half mile from, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">workshop, and when we hurried there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was to find Bronson entangled in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreckage of steel and other metals. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauled him forth. His clothes were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">shreds, his body terribly bruised and</seg><seg type="columnLine">battered, and it was some time before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could be made to realize where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. "Brandy!" he exclaimed; "for</seg><seg type="columnLine">God's sake give me brandy!" We gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him brandy and other things, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor patched him up, and we rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to a hospital, where in time he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered from the shock and his broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones knit. But the beauty that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been his was forever marred by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">livid scar diagonally crossing the nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and running to the bulge of the jaw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had read H. G. Wells' "The Time Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine," as who has not, deeming it fan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tastic fiction.

The room turned around</seg><seg type="columnLine">me like a pin-wheel, dissolved into mist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was conscious of the terrible vibration</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the machine, of a deathly sickness at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pit of my stomach. Blackness fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed the mist. Wells describes what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the character in his story saw as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">journeyed into the future, the procession</seg><seg type="columnLine">of days and nights ever accelerating their</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion, but I saw nothing like that, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MENTANICALS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">65</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">haps from the beginning the speed was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too great. Terrified, bewildered, I yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">retained enough presence of mind to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">press the lever into neutral and so bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine to a halt. Moments passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I lolled in my seat, blind, dazed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then my vision cleared--and I could see.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was day. Sunlight fell around me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everything was strange--and different.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How can I make you see what I saw?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The machine stood near one end of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great, open square that was surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by massive buildings. Those buildings!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had never seen their like before. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet there was a similarity of line, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mathematical precision which linked them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the architecture of New York and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago. It was as if the building con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction of to-day had been carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an extreme length. As if the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine had carried it forzuard. I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that at the moment, but later. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The walls of the massive buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">were broken by yawning doorways. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, I thought, is the future; it can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing less than that. I stepped out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine, holding on to it for sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port, still feeling terribly sick and giddy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I saw the cylinders! They came</seg><seg type="columnLine">gliding from one of the openings in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an upright fashion, and this was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">singular thing about them, that their</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of locomotion were not apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the eye. There were no wheels or</seg><seg type="columnLine">treads. They appeared to skim the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">or concrete with which the square was</seg><seg type="columnLine">paved, rather than touch it. Oddly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pellant they were, and intimidating, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I loosened the automatic in its shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster--the small one I always carry--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and prepared for emergencies, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets were useless against the cylinders</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I was to discover later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE cylinders were smooth things</seg><seg type="columnLine">about five feet tall, of a dulled metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">hue, with here and there shining spots</seg><seg type="columnLine">which constantly waxed and waned in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">color. They were machines--I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them as machines--and it was rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonable to suppose that behind them</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurked a human intelligence. The people</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the future, I thought, have invented</seg><seg type="columnLine">devices unknown to us of the Twentieth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Century; and it came over me how won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful it was going to be to meet those</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior people, talk to them, gaze upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marvels with which they had sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I went to meet the cylinders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their soft whispering meant noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to me at first. Nor at first did I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspect the source of the gentle pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure running over me from head to</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot, as the cylinders came close. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an odd thrill of apprehension I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that the curious cylinders were</seg><seg type="columnLine">handling, examining me, that from them</seg><seg type="columnLine">emanated an electrical force, a manipu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation of invisible rays which functioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">as organs of touch. Alone, bewildered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying vainly to comprehend the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation, I had to call on every ounce</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my self-control to remain calm. Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was afraid--only the fool says he</seg><seg type="columnLine">never is--but more afraid of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid, of showing fear. I still believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that behind those cylinders must lurk a</seg><seg type="columnLine">human intelligence. The genius of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">race seemed to run along the line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">making robots. There was the "metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain" at Washington, that told of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tides, the electrical eye which watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand industrial processes, a myriad</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic devices functioning with little</seg><seg type="columnLine">or no supervision from man; and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course I had read the play "R. U. R.,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">science fiction stories dealing with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future of machinery, and it was inevi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">table--strange, and yet not so strange--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I should expect an advancement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a realization of all those things in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future. Man the inventor, I thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had achieved them; and for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">this belief seemed borne out when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">66</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were in one of the buildings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the city of buildings, which I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon to know, lay on all sides of and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the square. I did not struggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the cylinders lifted and carried me</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. That is, I ceased my involuntary</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistance almost at once. It was use-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less to struggle against a force far su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perior to my own puny strength; be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides I believed the robots were carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me to their human masters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The building into which I was taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">--through an arched opening--was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast place; too vast, too overwhelming</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me to describe save in the vaguest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">most general terms. You know how it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is when you see something stupendous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">something so intricate that you are be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildered by its very complexity. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a huge room filled with almost noise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less machines rooted in their places like</seg><seg type="columnLine">shackled monsters, or going to and fro</seg><seg type="columnLine">on cables and grooves which determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">their spheres of activity. Strange lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed, weird devices toiled; but I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you no more than that; I saw them</seg><seg type="columnLine">for too short a time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men were among those machines.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At sight of them my heart leapt. Here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought, is the human intelligence back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wonders I view, the masters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylindrical robots; yet even at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment I was aware of a doubt, a mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the men shambled forward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His blond hair--long and matted--fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">o\ier the forehead and he brushed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">back with a taloned hand and stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me stupidly. "Hello!" I said, "what</seg><seg type="columnLine">place is this, what year? Tell these</seg><seg type="columnLine">robots of yours to let me go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was naked and thin, his skin of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a greenish pallor, and save for a mouth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of toothless gums, vouchsafed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">no answer. Chilled by his lack of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponse my heart fell as suddenly as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had leapt. Good God! I thought, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't be master here, this pitiful thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The cylinders seemed watching atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively, listening. I don't know how, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they gave me that impression; and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">I noticed that the shining spots on them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were glowing intensely, that their whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pering was not a steady but a modulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound. As if it were language, I thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">language! and a strange dread came over</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and I shivered as if with cold. Other</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, perhaps a dozen in number came</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, naked and shambling, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupid beast-like looks on their faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rumblings in their throats. In vain</seg><seg type="columnLine">I endeavored to communicate with them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">human intelligence seemed dead back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lack-luster eyes. Filled with rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror, I squirmed in the grip of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders and suddenly their hold on me</seg><seg type="columnLine">relaxed and I tore myself free and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fled, possessed with but one overwhelm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing desire, and that was to win to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time machine, leave this uncanny future</seg><seg type="columnLine">and return to my own day and age. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arched opening leading to the square</seg><seg type="columnLine">had vanished, blank wall rose where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been. The cylinders appeared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch me with cold impersonal watchful-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. The thought of being marooned</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them in this incredible and alien</seg><seg type="columnLine">future brought the chill sweat to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead, but I did not lose my head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps the closing of the doorway had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been a calculated thing; perhaps if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I awaited events with caution and pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tience the door would re-open; meantime</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could search for other exits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT other exits did not give on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">square I desired. I discovered but</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of them anyway, though there may</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been many more, one leading into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dark, forbidding tunnel, the other giv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing access to a second square entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded by buildings. I was afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">to venture into other buildings for fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of going astray, of losing the neighbor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood of the time machine. Filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">what feelings you can imagine, I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MEJNTANICALS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the first doorway (through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had been carried) to find it still</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed. Then I thought of the beast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like men. Perhaps they possessed knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge that might be helpful to me; per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps after all I could succeed in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">municating with them. It was hazardous</seg><seg type="columnLine">work penetrating any distance in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">maze of almost noiseless and ever-toiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanisms, but I followed in the foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps of the timidly retreating beast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and so at last came to a kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatting place in the midst of the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chinery, which locality appeared to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">their place of abode, since a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">women with children cowered there, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men showed a disposition to pause</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dispute my further progress. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the squatting place I seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, my automatic ready for ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and lit a cigarette. I know of noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that soothes the nerves like nico-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tine. Slowly the beast-men drew near</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I smiled and made peaceful ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures. Some half-grown children crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer and fingered my clothes. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were eating, I noticed, a kind of biscuit</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they took at will from a scuttle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like machine, and chewing small pellets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Water ran through a huge metal trough</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a subdued roar. After awhile I</seg><seg type="columnLine">got up and went to the trough to satisfy</seg><seg type="columnLine">a growing thirst, helping myself at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time to biscuits from the scuttle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were rather flat in flavor--lacking</seg><seg type="columnLine">salt perhaps--and possessed a peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">taste I did not like. The pellets were</seg><seg type="columnLine">better. They too were obtained from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scuttle-machine (I can call them nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">else) and were pleasant to chew. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon discovered that swallowed at regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervals one of them gave all the sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sations of having partaken of a hearty</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal. I had eaten an hour--or was it</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty centuries?--before, but ate again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling ravenously hungry. Probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pellets represented a dehydrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">method of concentrating foods, far in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">advance of that utilized in the prepara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of certain foodstuffs today. Be</seg><seg type="columnLine">that as it may, I filled my pockets with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and I dare say if you were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">search the clothes I returned in you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will find some of those pellets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I SPENT several hours at the squat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting place of the beast-men trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk to them, but without success. Seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly they were as are the animals of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field, lacking coherent language, men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had somehow lost the power to</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk, to think, the ability to grasp the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning of simple signs, such as pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed by the lowliest aborigine to-day. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">vain I speculated as to the reason for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this. That the cylinders were somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible I felt certain. Man, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, had developed the robot, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic machine, until the human</seg><seg type="columnLine">worker was ejected from the industrial</seg><seg type="columnLine">process and cast out to degenerate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perish, the beast-men being a surviving</seg><seg type="columnLine">remnant of those toilers. This reason-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing seemed plausible enough at the time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it left much to be desired, for, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the twentieth century from which I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come, wasn't the machine replacing hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man workers with a ruthlessness sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestive of what I found in the future?</seg><seg type="columnLine">How right I was in my reasoning, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">how wrong, you will shortly see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thinking thus it was natural that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should again turn my attention to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders. Never once had I been free</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their observation, or unconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. Through them, I thought, I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">contact the rulers of this realm, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">human masters whose servants they are,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pitiless ones who have doomed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion of humanity to beast-hood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">extinction. So I grimly waited--a prey</seg><seg type="columnLine">to what emotions you can imagine--</seg><seg type="columnLine">observing the beast-men, watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blank wall for the possible opening of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way to the square and the time ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine, and all the time aware of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">68</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">coming and going of those cylinders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Time passed; how much of it I had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of telling, since my wrist-watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">refused to run; but a long time; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally I grew tired of waiting for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylindrical robots to communicate my</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence to their masters, or to conduct</seg><seg type="columnLine">me there, and decided to seek their</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By way of the opening already al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luded to, I gained access to the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">square. The squares were a peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">feature of the place, as I was soon to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn. There were no streets or roads</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading from square to square; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">squares were isolated with radiating ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teries always ending against some build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing--at least those did, that I explored.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dusk was falling as I entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">square. Indescribably lonely it was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonely and weird, to look up and see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars blazing far overhead. I followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">one radiating artery to a blank wall;</seg><seg type="columnLine">another, another. Then suddenly I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too tired to proceed further and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the vicinity of the closed door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I lay down at the base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blank wall and fell asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning I filled my pockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">with pellets and again started out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Square after square I passed through,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and building after building. The cyl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inders were everywhere but did not in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terfere with my movements. A group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them constantly accompanied me, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether always composed of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders I could not tell. Their inces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sant whispering was a nerve-wracking</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, and I often felt like turning on</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and shooting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I WISH I could tell you all I saw:</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings full of toiling machinery</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now and then a score or so of beast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men; squares and radiating arteries</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a blade of grass or a tree, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">never an animal, a bird, or an insect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On that first day of exploration, despite</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">every precaution, I lost my way--hope-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly--and spent futile hours trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">retrace my steps. I have been lost in</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropical jungles. There was that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Siam. But never before had I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">so panic-stricken. Remember, I was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">alien creature in an incredible future,</seg><seg type="columnLine">separated from the only means of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning to my own place and time. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">square was like another, one building</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar to its neighbor. Soon I gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the vain effort to return to my start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing point. My sole hope now lay in</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding the rulers of this bewildering</seg><seg type="columnLine">maze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night--I knew it was night when</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness fell in the squares--I slaked my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirst with a trickle of water running</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a pipe, swallowed a pellet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost instantly sank into the sleep of</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhaustion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day I came to a part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city free of the beast-men. The squares</seg><seg type="columnLine">were larger, the radiating arteries were</seg><seg type="columnLine">spendid roads, but in the midst of many</seg><seg type="columnLine">squares stood circular buildings not met</seg><seg type="columnLine">with before. I entered one of them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was surprised to find huge rooms filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with pieces of rusted tools, shovels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spades, chisels, hammers, axe-heads, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">displayed in a kind of chronological or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der. The thought of its being a museum</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not occur to me at once. It was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a while that I exclaimed to my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, "Why this looks like a museum!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the inevitable conviction came: "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a museum!" But who could have ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged it? Certainly not the witless</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast-men, and of other men I had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. This failure to find human be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, on a par with the stupendous build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings and machines all around, filled me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with anxious forboding. I gazed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders. For the first time it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">over me that they were the only uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versal inhabitants I had seen. Bewild-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered, amazed, I wandered from building</seg><seg type="columnLine">to building, and from floor to floor (for</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MENTANICALS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the buildings had as many as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen floors accessible to myself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained not by stairways, but by gradu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally mounting run-Ways or ramps in cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cular wells), engrossed in what I saw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgetting for the nonce my terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">plight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were chambers filled with frag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of machines such as cash-registers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clock-wheels, gasoline engines, and simi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar devices. Nothing was complete; near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly everything showed the wear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tear of time. And there were others</seg><seg type="columnLine">containing various machines more or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">correctly reassembled from ancient parts :</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobiles, for instance, and locomo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives; with an arrangement of simpler</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanical forms leading to more com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plex ones. I couldn't comprehend why</seg><seg type="columnLine">all those things had been gathered to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether for preservation and display; nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">account for the age of them, their gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral condition of ruin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not on that day, nor on the next--</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was on the last day that I spent in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange future--did I come to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">library. And here I must touch on an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other phase of my adventure. You can</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no idea how horrible it became</seg><seg type="columnLine">at times to be alone among hundreds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yes, thousands of whispering cylinders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was always aware of their subtle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible touch. Have you ever felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the antennae of an insect? Like that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, like that. I recall one time on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gold Coast. . . . Only it bolstered up</seg><seg type="columnLine">my tottering sanity and control to gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and then on creatures similar in</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure to myself, even if they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the soulless beast-men of the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines. For in all that vast and intricate</seg><seg type="columnLine">city they were the only human beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could discover, and I began to suspect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dread, I scarcely knew what.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I CAME to the library, I say, on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">last day. I did not know it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">library at first--and perhaps I was mis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">taken in believing the odd metal disks</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged in piles on shelves and tables,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and consulted by the cylinders, to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">species of recording plates--but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">here I found the books. They were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxes of thin metal, the better evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">to protect them from injury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thrill of seeing those books! Old,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were, old, covers gone, pages tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">and missing; but they were books and</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazines, though few in number, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I examined them eagerly. All this time '</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinders were following me, watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me, as if weighing my actions, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the time I fought back a feeling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">weirdness, uncanniness. Unnerving it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, intimidating. I had the feeling that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some perfectly incomprehensible way</seg><seg type="columnLine">my actions were being controlled, di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rected. Experimenting, I thought, that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they're doing, experimenting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. But you mustn't get the idea that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I realized or suspected this at first. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to that moment I was still thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cylinders as automatic devices</seg><seg type="columnLine">without intelligence or reason, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be kept in mind that, if I speak of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from time to time as if understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their true nature from the begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning, I am speaking as one who looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">back upon past happenings from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage-point of later knowledge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The books and magazines were typed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in English! I was amazed of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing English print at such a time and</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. The whispering of the cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders rose louder and louder as I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amined a book. The title page was gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It dealt with a dry subject--physics evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently--which interested me little. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned from the books to the magazines.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One was dated 1960. Nineteen-sixty!</seg><seg type="columnLine">March of that year. And the place of</seg><seg type="columnLine">publication was given as New York. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not help but marvel at this, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">1960 was still twenty-six years in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future when I left that night on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time machine, and to judge by the yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">70</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing pages of the magazine it was old,</seg><seg type="columnLine">old. It was difficult to decipher the</seg><seg type="columnLine">print, many of the pages being torn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">defaced; but a portion of an article I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was able to read. "In 1933," stated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown writer, "the first mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain-cell was invented; with its use a</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine was able to learn by experience</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find its way through a maze.

What is this miracle taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">place under our eyes, what of good and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ill does it bode to its creators?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Marveling much, i turned to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">another magazine in much the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same condition, but this time lacking date</seg><seg type="columnLine">or title page, where I gleaned the fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Man is not a machine in the purely</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanical sense, though many of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">functions are demonstrably mechanical.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ability to reason, however it has</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolved, whatever it may be at bottom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether a bewildering complexity of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flex actions or not, lifts man above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignity of--a machine. Does this imply</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impossibility of creating machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">(mechanical brains) that can profit by</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience, go through the processes</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we call thought?

The roar of the discharge</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed through the huge room, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of the Mentanicals fell; their metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">exteriors were impregnable to such</seg><seg type="columnLine">things as bullets. Trembling from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaction of rage, the feeling of futility,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I lifted my hand to hurl the useless</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon at the immobile cylinders, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the very act of doing so was stiffened</seg><seg type="columnLine">into rigidity by the sound of a voice--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">human voice! Inexpressibly weird and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mournful was that voice, heard so un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectedly as it was in that place, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the moment following the explosion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pistol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Oh," cried the voice, as if talking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, "to be 'chained in this spot, never</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave it, never to know what that</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise means! Who is there?" it cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who is there?" And then in tones</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrilling with unutterable sadness, "Mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man that I am to expect an answer!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was an answer! I shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in reply. I can hardly recall now what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shouted. Hearing that human voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the infernal whispering of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentanicals was like being reprieved</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a horror too great to be borne.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as I shouted incoherently, I sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direction the voice seemed to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from, the cylinders making no effort to</seg><seg type="columnLine">oppose my doing so. The wall had ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared smooth and unbroken from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance, but a nearer view showed an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening which gave entrance to a room</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, while small in comparison to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge one it adjoined, was nevertheless</seg><seg type="columnLine">large. It was lighted, as were all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms I had seen, by a soft light of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I could never trace the source.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I entered the room, calling out, filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with excitement* and then at the sight of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">what I saw, came to an abrupt pause,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for on a low dais occupying the mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle of the room was the figure of a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">with lolling head. Only this head was</seg><seg type="columnLine">free--a massive head with towering</seg><seg type="columnLine">brow and wide-spaced eyes. The eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dark and filled with sorrow, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face--the face of a man in the seventies</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps--etched with suffering. I stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">--stared in astonishment--for the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung as if crucified on what I at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">took for a dully gleaming cross. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">can I describe it? I did not see every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in that first glance, of course, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the second, though I tell it here as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I had. But his outstretched arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">were secured to the cross-piece of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">support with metal bands, his legs held</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same fashion. So clear was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass--or crystal enveloping him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the neck down--that it was some mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments before I suspected its presence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw the gleaming, transparent tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which ran a bluish liquid, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsating mechanism at his breast, pump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, pumping, the radiating box at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet which gave forth a distinct aura;</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw, and could not restrain myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">from giving voice to an audible ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamation: "Good God!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dark eyes focused on me, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips moved. "Who are you?" breathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My name is Bronson," I replied ;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God help me," he said. "I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bane Borgson."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bane Borgson! I stared at him, wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed. Where had I heard that name</seg><seg type="columnLine">before? My mind groped. Now I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. In the articles recently read. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he said.

The world of man was growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">bored, indifferent, but we scientists--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">handful of us--lived for the gaining of</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge. This intellect of mine was</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered essential by my fellows;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so they experimented with me, and fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ioned for my use a mechanical heart--</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see it pulsing at my breast--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled my veins with radiant energy in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of blood. Radium," he said, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the basis of the miracle you see; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my body was enclosed in its crystal</seg><seg type="columnLine">casing. 'When you are tired,' they said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'and wish to die . . . ' But the Debacle</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, the accursed Mentanicals turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">against me, and I was left alone, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted. Before that my friends offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">me death. Fool that I was," cried Bane</seg><seg type="columnLine">Borgson, "I refused their gift. 'No,'</seg><seg type="columnLine">I told them, 'this is but a temporary</seg><seg type="columnLine">upheaval. Man will conquer, must con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quer; I await your return.' So they</seg><seg type="columnLine">left me, to hunt for food, and I waited,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited, but they never came back.' Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked tears flowed down the withered</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks. 'Never,' he said, 'never. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">chained in my place I could sense but</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly the tragedy that was overtaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, the rise to power of the ensouled</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines. At first they worshiped</seg><seg type="columnLine">me as a god. In some fashion they</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that I was their creator and paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">me divine honors.

Fifteen generations of Mentan-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">icals have come and gone since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Debacle, and now the Mentanicals be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve that they were not made by man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but have evolved from simpler median-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fcal forms over a long period of time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is, their scholars and scientists be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve this, though the old superstition still</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingers among thousands.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stood there, a silent group, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man on the dias spoke; now their whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pering began, softly, insistently.

How I had failed to see it on</seg><seg type="columnLine">first entering the room it is impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say. Perhaps the sight of the man on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dais had riveted my attention to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclusion of all else.

At length he turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. 'Listen,' he said tensely, 'they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">never learned to enunciate or understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">human speech, but in many ways the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentanicals are more formidable, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced than man in his prime.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I laughed at this.

Besides you failed to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">their museums with articulated bodies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and beasts.

'The Mentani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cals' system of thought, of science, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">coherent and rational to them; and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">there be contradictions, well, does that</seg><seg type="columnLine">interfere with them making scientific dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coveries transcending those of man?</seg><seg type="columnLine">They have long been discussing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">phenomenon of time and the feasibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">of traveling in it.

But you know radio--</seg><seg type="columnLine">yes, radio--they have been utilizing dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coveries in that field to send messages</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in time. Your coming here has</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been accidental--do you understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">that?--not entirely accidental.

So</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are puzzled, they don't quite under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand (that is why they have been ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perimenting with you), but soon they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will.

Later on in the evening a strange red ray emerges</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the jungle, cutting a path through the trees, destroying the flagstaff and narrowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">missing the bungalow itself. The two men, with their manager, Retallick, arrange to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">watches all night, as they begin to suspect the strange ray may be connected with the supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteorite they saw earlier. Spain and Harper leave Retallick to take first watch. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men awake in broad daylight to find Retallick has disappeared. Arming themselves, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">wives and some of their native retainers, they follow the path cut by the ray through the jungle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They come suddenly on a spaceship and are overpowered by strange beings. They are</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken on board, where they find Retallick. The space-ship immediately sets out for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet Mars. The Martians turn out to be kindly folk, and the little party grow accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their lot. They learn the Martian language and are shown many strange scientific wonders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our American friends are talking with Bo-Kar, a Martian, when a gong is heard from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths of the ship. Another space-ship has materialized and shown hostile intentions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Martian space-ship is attacked. The Earth people are taken to the observation</seg><seg type="columnLine">room to watch the battle. They group about an apparatus which is a development of televi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. It is a battle of sinister rays and for a while things look as if the Martians are going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lose their first space battle. However, the Martian ray strips a portion of the outer shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the attacking sphere and cracks the interior lining, totally disabling it. An exploring par*,</seg><seg type="columnLine">set out in space suits from the Martian ship to investigate the disabled sphere. As the party</seg><seg type="columnLine">move around in the dismantled space-ship they find the most diabolical creatures--all dead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The records cannot be deciphered, so the sphere is towed to Mars. About six weeks after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle the Martian space-ship sights Mars. A great welcome is extended to the earth people and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the returning Martians. After the celebrations are over and things are again normal, the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians set about investigating the enemy sphere, which waa brought along. It is found that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere came from Ados, a planet roughly 370.000 miles from earth's moon and approximately</seg><seg type="columnLine">620,000 miles from earth, and it looks as if the Adosians mean to give earth and Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. The earth people had been on Mars almost a year when they are summoned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear before the Council of Three. They are informed that Rocan (Martian) astronomers</seg><seg type="columnLine">have kept Ados under constant observation ever since their arrival and that for the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">month or so certain indications of activity have appeared on that satellite's surface. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Council is of the opinion that earth should be informed of what the Martians have learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ados. (The satellite Ados, by the way, is unknown to earth astronomers, as it is on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side of the moon.) Mars will help earth fight Ados, if necessary, if earth will grant</seg><seg type="columnLine">them mineral concessions on its moon.

It was quite possible that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the haze itself, which seemed to extend</seg><seg type="columnLine">some distance out into the void, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shell or perhaps an atmosphere cover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Ados, would be remarked from earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whether they would draw the right de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ductions from the phenomenon, of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could not say; for my part I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclined to fancy that it would be at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tributed to some unprecedented activity</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the further side of the moon. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetoid itself must be possessed of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very low density, otherwise its influence</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have made itself felt ages before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but on the whole I imagined that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">composed of light, spongy material, or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">else that a good deal of its interior had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been hollowed into vast empty caverns.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Martian astronomers supported the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter view.

Mars gave them of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its best, for the romance had seized on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the popular imagination, and the actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">celebrations were televisophoned all</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the planet. It would, I suppose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been a great event even in our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumultuous world; on one grown old and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sated, where life had become an orderly</seg><seg type="columnLine">procession of days, it was something of</seg><seg type="columnLine">national importance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came the day of our departure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with it, we all admitted, a sadness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had grown to like the Martians.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once their confidence was gained and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the armor of their reserve penetrated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they proved good fellows underneath--</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet, grave people, no doubt, but, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt, sincere. They were not demonstra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive, yet when it came to parting we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">showered with gifts. I particularly dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked parting from Thrang; our friend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship with him had grown as the days</seg><seg type="columnLine">went by, and to him we owed most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the understanding we possessed of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet and its ways. Yet we left each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other with the expressed hope that some</seg><seg type="columnLine">day we might meet again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fifteen ships lifted one after an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other into the thin Martian air--great</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden-bronze shapes glowing in the yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low sunlight--up and up until the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet dwindled away in space beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">us.

There was no longer any dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust between us.

Retal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lick, as a matter of course, was shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">all there was to be shown; as Bo-Kar's</seg><seg type="columnLine">son-in-law it might be necessary for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">one day to step into his commander's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes, and I should imagine that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of regard for him and the stock</seg><seg type="columnLine">from whence he sprung that Norna de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined we should not be left in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorance. Also, there was probably the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling in Bo-Kar s mind, that the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be made smoother for him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long run, if some of the ships could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">manned and captained by Earth-men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At least it would show that the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians had no desire to drive an unpal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atable bargain by means of a weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they alone possessed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So we were given our turns at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls.

A logical principle under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay each act, and once the principle was</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized the rest came easy. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">navigating that I found hardest. It in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volved intricate calculations that must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">accurate to a decimal, for space-flying is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not like sea-traveling. In the latter one</seg><seg type="columnLine">sets a course for a fixed object, but in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the void not only is the ship itself mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, but the planet that is its destination</seg><seg type="columnLine">84</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">is also traveling in space. The rates of</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of planet and space-ship must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculated, and a course plotted that al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows the ship to intersect the orbit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet at the earliest possible moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Other factors, such as delays and stop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pages, have to be taken into account as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they occur, and the calculations con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly revised to meet the new circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances as they arise.

For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first week or so there was little to see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as the Moon and Ados again swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">around from behind the earth, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a quickening of interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our first notification was to the ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect that the green haze was still shroud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the planetoid.

Our heat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">recording instruments, similar in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction to the thermocouple used on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, which is so delicately adjusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it can measure the heat of a candle</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mile away, showed us that it could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be the result of volcanic activity or</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything that involved an actual rise in</seg><seg type="columnLine">TERROR OUT OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">85</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">temperature. Accordingly we had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandon our original theory that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green haze was similar in its nature to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green heat-ray, with which the Ado-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sian sphere had tried to annihilate us on</seg><seg type="columnLine">our voyage to Mars. Puzzling and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it was, we could only await develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments and trust to luck to bring some</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution as our course took us past Ados.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently, as our conditions for ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servation grew better, those on Mars be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came worse. The red planet was swing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing around on its orbit, so that the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">now rose between it and earth. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular intervals our picture machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">recorded the movements of our planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its two satellites. I was insistent on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, for I felt that, only by presenting</seg><seg type="columnLine">a complete and incontrovertible pictorial</seg><seg type="columnLine">record, could we hope to convince the</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers that be of the truth of our story.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Martians and their space-ships they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to accept, or else deny the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence of their own senses, but the tale</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a second satellite would take some</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallowing. I am not blaming anyone in</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance, of course: I would have felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">much the same myself in a similar situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and it was the knowledge of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own deficiencies that gave me an acute</seg><seg type="columnLine">realization of those of others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MORE than two-thirds of our jour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney had been covered without any</seg><seg type="columnLine">untoward incident, and we were just be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning to hope that we would get</seg><seg type="columnLine">through unscathed, when the first dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbing event occurred. Our course had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been altered slightly to take us in be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the Moon and Ados, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably this that precipitated matters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had been subject to magnetic in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluences, obviously radiating from Ados,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some considerable time, but, as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were able to counteract them quite effi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciently, we were not alarmed, particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as there was nothing to indicate that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of a harmful nature. Neverthe-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">less the fact, that such influences were</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming over, did good, in that it kept us</seg><seg type="columnLine">constantly on the alert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I think it was somewhere in the mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle of the fifth week out that Bo-Kar</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent for Spain and me. The message</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran that he wanted us at once, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would find him in the little room he</seg><seg type="columnLine">used off the control-quarters. I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place; we had been there several</seg><seg type="columnLine">times already, and I remembered it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitted up as a sort of chart-room, plus</seg><seg type="columnLine">living quarters. It was here that as com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mander he lived, worked, slept and ate</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the greater part of the voyage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That there were others in the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides himself, I saw as soon as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the door in response to his invita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to come in. Noma and Retallick I</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-expected, but the sight of the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">person, one of the televisophonic oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ators, made me wonder what was afoot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not think of anything that could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone wrong, and that would in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volve the presence of the operator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bo-Kar, however, did not leave us</seg><seg type="columnLine">long in doubt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something queer has happened," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "and I have called you here think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that you may be able to help. Mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sages that we cannot understand have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been coming through for some time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are not in any language we know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but since our knowledge is limited to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rocan and the tongue you speak I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought . . . However, this will explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than I."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned toward the table and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time I noticed that a small ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine, not unlike a gramophone, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing on it. Beside it were half-a-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen black wax discs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We take records of all messages that</seg><seg type="columnLine">come over the televisophone," Bo-Kar</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained, as he fitted one of the discs</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the machine. "That, of course, is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary precaution in case we want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">refer to them later. These messages I</seg><seg type="columnLine">86</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">speak about have all been recorded. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall start the first one now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The machine began with an abrupt</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirr of sound, that changed instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a note that seemed vaguely familiar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A note not unmusical, yet not like</seg><seg type="columnLine">music as we know it. My thoughts flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the last night we spent on earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the queer stuff I had heard coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the radio set. Yet there was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing different in this. The other had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a smoothness, a rhythm, if you will; this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was harsher, more intense. There seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be an urgency in it, and somehow I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not help feeling that it was charged</seg><seg type="columnLine">with menace, that it threatened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The record ended. Bo-Kar stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"TT is no earth language that I know,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">X I said, waiting, wondering if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had any idea what it was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the moment we looked at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other eye to eye, then: "That is as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined it would be," he said calmly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"None the less I thought this might not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be altogether unfamiliar to you. Am I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," I told him. "I should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">told you before. That's the call I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night before we first met you, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I mistook for a call from your</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship." •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "From the Roca,:&gt; he said. "Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you spoke about that, just before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">met the sphere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's certainly curious," I commented.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Of course it looks as if they're from</seg><seg type="columnLine">another sphere, if not from Ados it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bo-Kar smiled oddly. "They come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Ados," he said. "There is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt of that. Our directional instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments can hardly be as much out as</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, despite this magnetic influence</seg><seg type="columnLine">they're radiating."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think," said Spain abruptly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"that they're trying to send us a message</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sorts?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen," said Bo-Kar. "I shall put</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other records through, and judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">for yourselves from what you hear."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were half a dozen of them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, and Bo-Kar put them through in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the order in which they had been re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived. Each one began on a tenser note</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the last, and the final one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">six rose to a menacing crescendo of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound that made the walls of the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrate. I could never have imagined</seg><seg type="columnLine">that so much terror could be conveyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by any voice in all the Universe. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">one we heard was charged with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">unearthly power that flicked the raw</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends of our nerves and seared our brains</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sounds that hurt as materially as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hot iron. It ended on a single note</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lifted horror to the heights, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to seize and shake us until our</seg><seg type="columnLine">very souls rattled in our bodies like dried</seg><seg type="columnLine">peas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The end came with a harsh abruptness</seg><seg type="columnLine">that left me quivering and unmanned. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stole a furtive glance at Spain. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiping the beads of sweat from a damp</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead. Retallick looked shocked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave, and even Norna trembled. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">operator had gritted his teeth at the start</seg><seg type="columnLine">and put his hands over his ears. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bo-Kar alone seemed unaffected. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron nerve was capable apparently of</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The odd part of the whole thing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deadly menace of the voice, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">threat of worse things it conveyed. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">does not need to know a language to</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize that. The warning growl of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfamiliar wild beast, cornered by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunter, makes its meaning plainer than</seg><seg type="columnLine">print.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There followed a little pause while,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-ashamed, we essayed to pull our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves together. Bo-Kar swept his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the little circle, as though to sum</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the effect the demonstration had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">TERROR OUT OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">87</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on us. Wc all remained in dead silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you think of it now?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked at length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, the meaning's plain enough,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Retallick burst out. "It's a warning and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's meant for us. They must be watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing us, must see how we're heading and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckon we're coming too close. I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">think they're trying to tell us of the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible things that will happen if we come</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bo-Kar did not comment on that, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared vacantly ahead, as though he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning that over in his mind.' Noma</seg><seg type="columnLine">plucked at his sleeve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I THINK that, too," she said with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shiver. "But I would go further</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my deductions. Behind all that men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ace, those threats--whatever they were--</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, I thought, a faint note of fear, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread that we might see perhaps too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much, that by coming nearer we might</seg><seg type="columnLine">interfere with whatever evil they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">planning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had not struck me before in quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fashion, but now that she put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea forward I felt the truth of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think Noma's right," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bo-Kar slanted his eyes around upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spain. "And you?" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm rather of the same opinion now,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">my partner answered, "but that perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">is merely because the others have put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea into my head. The only thing I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, though, is that if I were in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes, I wouldn't let it stop me from do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing whatever I wanted to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't intend to let it," said Bo-Kar</seg><seg type="columnLine">incisively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hadn't finished," said Spain coolly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was quite calm now and had got him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self under control again. "I was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to point out, though I dare'-say you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">already seen it for yourself, that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be threatened like that unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">they meant to keep us away by every</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible means. Now I agree with Norna</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">there, that they seem afraid, and, if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are, why, don't you see that it means</seg><seg type="columnLine">they believe that, as things are, we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">donkey-lick them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bo-Kar drew his brows together in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled frown, and turned to Retallick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What does the man mean?" he asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Some of his words seem strange to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Retallick chuckled, and grinned at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spain. "I'm not surprised at that," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Spain always gets slangy when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gets excited. But what he means is</seg><seg type="columnLine">this": And with that he put it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">words Bo-Kar would understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I agree," was Bo-Kar's comment at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end. "But even if it were not so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we should go on. It is our duty to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much as we can of our potential en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">emies, for the fate of two worlds may</seg><seg type="columnLine">hang on our knowledge. I only wish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though," he went on, "that our scientists</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been able to solve the secret of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">green ray. But the machinery for gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erating it had been irreparably injured</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the cold of space after we captured</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sphere, and its composition must re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main unknown. We, however, have had</seg><seg type="columnLine">bigger and better generators installed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and what our rays did once I should say</seg><seg type="columnLine">they can do again, if the need arises.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Which I hope it won't," he added.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned to the operator. "You may</seg><seg type="columnLine">go, Norvin," he said. "You and your</seg><seg type="columnLine">colleagues, however, must take records</seg><seg type="columnLine">of every sound that comes through,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether it seems an intelligent message</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man saluted and turned to go.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At that moment there came a sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">knock on the door.

With her lesser bulk she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could manoeuvre more easily, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar-shaped Roca, even in the fric-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionless void, took time to swing around.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For our own sakes we had to go can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nily, for an abrupt change of direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, at the speed at which we were trav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eling, might well have meant the deaths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It did occur to me as rather odd that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sphere should have made no at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt to show fight, then I recollected</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other fourteen ships following us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of them must be near enough for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Adosians to see, in which case they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">probably realized that in a straightout</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight they would almost certainly be</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamped in the end by superior num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers, no matter what initial damage</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might inflict on one or two ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rest of the fleet had been ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised of the situation and were given</seg><seg type="columnLine">their orders by televisophone, and pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently they swung out behind us in a fan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped formation with the outer ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">at each end heading out in a wide circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">at constantly increasing speed with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident intention of cutting the sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">off from her home base. Unless the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adosian machine could develop a speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would leave us cold, it looked as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though we might succeed after all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sphere looked slightly larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">now than she had a few minutes pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viously. We were gaining on her, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether she had reached the full limits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her acceleration, of course, we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not say. Bo-Kar was inclined to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she daren't stretch herself to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">utmost; she might not be able to retard</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time to save herself from crashing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mass of incandescence on the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planetoid. It was the realization</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that peril, too, that kept us from</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising to peak in our turn. Our ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the end of the formation, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now beginning to resemble a crescent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were running no such risk. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching Ados at a slant, and, unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Adosians possessed some weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which we were as yet unfamiliar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was little likelihood of them strik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing trouble in that direction. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed would carry them past the planet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oid and out of its sphere of attraction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their instruments would warn them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time, should there be any danger of</seg><seg type="columnLine">encountering an atmospheric envelope in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the friction might heat them up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT just as we were beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">plume ourselves in the hope that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sphere would be neatly headed off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">TERROR OUT OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an unexpected thing occurred. She sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly changed direction, slanting across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disc of the planetoid, and headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight for the ship on that horn of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">crescent line. At the same time that</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible infra-red ray must have leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her. We did not grasp what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was happening, until the thin green pen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cil began to climb up and reach out to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards the Martian ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As 1 hurriedly reached for the emer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gency glasses on the rack on the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">near us, I saw the others following</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit. The Martians on the pursuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, however, must have sized up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation half-a-second sooner than we</seg><seg type="columnLine">did, or perhaps her commander had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready taken the precaution of donning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ray-filtering goggles. At any rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green pencil ray had covered no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than half the distance when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep glowing crimson beam flashed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Martian ship, and hit the Ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">osians' ray squarely. Then began the</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle between two Titanic forces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Martian ship must have turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the full power of its generators, for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch by inch, it seemed, the green pen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cil swayed back on itself. Then of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden it leaped forward again, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaining more than half the ground it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost. The conflicting Martian ray deep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened in tone, glowed until it hurt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes to look at it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bo-Kar beside me, staring into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision plate, uttered an exclamation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's that?" I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's using too much power,'' he</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered, evidently referring to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian ship. "He's too close to Ados."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He swung round to the televisophone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his voice, calling up the fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, snapped out in staccato sentences.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Conserve your power," he ordered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't deplete your generators. You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">too near Ados for that. You'll need all</seg><seg type="columnLine">your lift to keep you away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ship on the other horn of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">crescent was meanwhile overhauling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere from the rear, and as it came up</seg><seg type="columnLine">it swung its beam out on the silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">hull. And from that side of the sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">in turn there sprang another green</seg><seg type="columnLine">pencil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bo-Kar swung round to the vision-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate, and in one swift glance summed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE'LL try our own ray," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I don't know whether we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the range, but it's growing less all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He gave out his orders into the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struments connecting the various de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partments, and a moment later the vi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion-plate showed our own ray reaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from our nose-port. On three sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">now the Adosian sphere was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">heated by the combined rays of the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships, and the two green pencils it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot out seemed to be growing weaker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of a sudden they both snapped out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">as abruptly as man will switch off an</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric light, and the sphere itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped. For the moment I fancied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">combined influence of the three rays had</seg><seg type="columnLine">put it out of action, then I realized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible truth. The sphere had simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped of her own accord. The full</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of the rays from the Martian ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the opposing horns of the crescent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer playing on the sphere, struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other. The next instant they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned off, but in that small fraction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time the damage had been done. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship first to engage the Adosian, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators already badly depleted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">her initial expenditure of energy, reeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the impact of the ray from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sister, staggered, turned over, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught by the attractive force of Ados</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to fall, end over end, towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the planetoid. She struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green haze surrounding Ados broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side on, broke across the middle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vomited men and machinery out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">90</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">space. The green haze seemed to sag</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the force of the collision, then re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounded like a balloon suddenly swell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up and sent the broken fragments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Martian ship hurtling out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">void.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other ship staggered, but recov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered itself in time, and as the full lift</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its gravity screens was turned on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose wearily towards us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The observation room was filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">staccato exclamations of horror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At least we know what that green</seg><seg type="columnLine">haze is now," Bo-Kar said in a voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">we scarcely recognized as his, "but we've</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid too big a price for the discovery."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A vibratory screen," said Norna,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that exerts a repelling influence on any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that comes near it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bo-Kar gave a quick jerk of his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"In effect they've armored the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ados," he said. "But, look, quick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the sphere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sphere itself, a gleaming ball of</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver, seemingly no worse for what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had undergone, was dropping town to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards the planetoid. As it came close</seg><seg type="columnLine">we expected to see it rebound like our</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost ship, from the green haze, thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">upwards, but instead the haze parted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a great rift appeared in it. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps two seconds we caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of a dark, pitted and rugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface, not unlike that of the Moon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though here and there one could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">erections of a coal-black material with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dull shimmer of their own, that looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like huge buildings. Then the sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped down gently through the open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and the green haze closed instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time we could only stare at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wavering green surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetoid as men hypnotized, but, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were frozen into inaction, others had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been nothing of the sort. The communi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cator connected with one of the forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">observation compartments suddenly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">called attention. Norna, as the near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est, answered it. She allowed the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the speaker at the other end to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward in full volume, so we heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was being said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was one of the picture recorders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">very pleased with himself to judge from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tone. He and his brother recorder</seg><seg type="columnLine">had managed to get complete pictures of</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically every phase of the battle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their machines were still working when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green haze had parted, revealing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the instant that precious glimpse of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitted surface of Ados. They felt quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain that it would come out well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bo-Kar started from his reverie. "Tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">him," he said to Norna, "to develop the</seg><seg type="columnLine">negatives straight away.

"A little more convincing</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence for your people," he said, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I fancied there was a faint under-current</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sarcasm in his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded. I did not say what was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind, that the more the better since</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might all be needed yet. I had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">intention of damping Bo-Kar's hopes at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this juncture any more than I could help.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It should be an interesting record,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all I said, and to hide my face, lest</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might see there what I was thinking,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I bent over the vision plate again. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other ship was lifting towards us, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see no outward signs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble it had been through. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked down at the green surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetoid. We did not seem to be re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceding ; it looked as though we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely keeping our distance constant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">TERROR OUT OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">91</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">yet 1 Ha.d an idea that we should be ris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and the little world growing smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smaller. Then:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. "Bo-Kar," I said sharply, "am I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreaming or are we falling?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "-We can't be falling," he answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly, and turned for confirmation to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dial recorders, duplicates of those in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the control room. I looked over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder at them. They showed us</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising to the full lift of our power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We stared at one another. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been mistaken," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He wasn't, We are falling."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We both swung round at the voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was Noma who had spoken. She and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Retallick were bending over the vision-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate. Bo-Kar and I hurried to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly yet quite definitely the planet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oid was growing. We were nearer its</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface; it looked larger than when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen it a few minutes before. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes had not tricked me in the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bo-Kar said under his breath some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that in anyone else I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken to be an oath, and flinging open</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door communicating with the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol room raced through. He left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door wide open, making no attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar us out, and since we were all by</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time competent navigators and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that point alone interested in the march</seg><seg type="columnLine">of events, we moved forward so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could see and hear what was hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The control-captain was just begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning to puzzle the matter out for him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. In the last few seconds he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become aware that something was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong, and 1 think he was a very greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">relieved man to find the work being</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken out of his hands. Whatever the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason, despite the fact that our gravity</seg><seg type="columnLine">screens were out, we were being pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly yet inexorably down to the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of Ados.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bo-Kar pushed the control aside,, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">too gently, and pressed one after another</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the huge bank of keys set in the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol table in front of him, and one after</seg><seg type="columnLine">another as the departments sprang to at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention he rattled out his orders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DLL lift of gravity screens, please,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "All sections of rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes to fire at once." He gave a glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the vision plate before him and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed an almost instantaneous calcula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in his head. We had swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">round a little, I could see by glancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his shoulder, and seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling at the nose. He had seen that</seg><seg type="columnLine">too as his next command showed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Forward tubes fire," he commanded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Maintain explosions until counter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then to us without looking up, "Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, all of you, and shut that door," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "You, Harper, check me over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision-plate. Norna, you and Retallick</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand by general communicators.

The better part of four hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand miles away, it loomed gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">above us. I swept the vision plate angle</seg><seg type="columnLine">again on the receding planetoid. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt of it now, it was growing per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptibly smaller, yet not so quickly as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have wished. The green haze had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken on an odd, shimmering quality that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I fancied might be due to distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as I looked the haze opened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a man in a hurry flings wide a door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">92</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and a host of silver spheres, like flies</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising from filth.

As they rose from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening they spread, so that my eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dazzled by the sunlight reflected</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their gleaming surfaces, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres than I could possibly count.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look out," I cried, scarcely aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what I was saying; the one thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">uppermost in my mind was to give the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm before it was too late.

Visions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the utter annihilation of the expedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion danced before my eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned to Bo-Kar to see how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was taking it. To my surprise he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not look in the least perturbed. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first sight of the second party of spheres</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had merely pressed half-a-dozen keys</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bank before him, one after anoth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er, and had then turned back to stare at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vision-plate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came an instant's flurry, in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which I was not quite sure which way</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Roca was heading, and when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked again it seemed that we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring down on the two flights of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres, with the moon and Ados re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceding beneath us. Then in a flash came</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were moving in a three dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional space, and were free, save for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the accident of a heavenly body being</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly in our path, to move in any di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection we pleased. Backwards or for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards, upwards or downwards was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to us. To any one used to mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in a two dimensional world, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">all motion other than the circumscribed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascent of an airplane or the descent</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a mine must be confined to the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, it took some time to realize that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we in the Roca were subjected to no</seg><seg type="columnLine">such limitations. We had merely risen</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the plane occupied by the spheres</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one far above them. Therefore as</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as we were concerned there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">such thing as being caught between two</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires unless they possessed such a su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perior speed that they could overhaul</seg><seg type="columnLine">and surround us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As this dawned on me I began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathe freely again.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never do to draw them after us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and have our world plunged without</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparation into all the horrors of inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetary warfare. We must have time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prepare, and if necessary to build</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships after the Martian model, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry the light back to Ados itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I found my mind actually trifling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the possibility of sending a warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of U3 to earth, but since this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the time to distract Bo-Kar's at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention I said nothing. The spheres were</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming up after us at a steep angle;</seg><seg type="columnLine">those we had first seen rounding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon had joined in the flight, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed as though it must be merely a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of seconds until the infra-red</seg><seg type="columnLine">beams with those streaks of green in</seg><seg type="columnLine">them began to stab out at us. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourteen ships were lifting in a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">line, a formation so devised that only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the rear ship presented any</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of a mark to the spheres. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship actually covered the one in front.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT as I watched I became aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the angle of flight had changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. As in a dream I heard Noma's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice over the general communicators</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing on her father's orders, heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quick clack-clack of his fingers over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank of control keys, and then some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how the surface of the moon seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">very near and very large and round.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ados and the spheres were no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible in the vision-plate. Bo-Kar</seg><seg type="columnLine">altered its angle so as to sweep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">full round of the moon, but look which</seg><seg type="columnLine">way we would we could see no sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sphere. But I did see something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent the blood pounding through my</seg><seg type="columnLine">veins, a great round misty bulk looming</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in the sky . . .earth!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had rounded the moon in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad flight, put its surface between us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and the pursuing spheres. Was earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bo-Kar turned his head slightly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke to me over his shoulder. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">can your astronomers see on the moon?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The question took me aback, and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment I did not quite grasp his</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning. He saw the blankness in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">face before I could speak, and guessing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reason of it framed the query in</seg><seg type="columnLine">another way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How large would an object there</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to be before they could see it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My ideas on that were hazy, but I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vague recollection of something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might supply him with a working basis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have heard it said," I told him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that anything the size of a church</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be visible to some of the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">observatories."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not know what a church was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I had to explain that, and give him</seg><seg type="columnLine">some idea of the average dimensions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a building. He looked a trifle dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointed at the information.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's night now in the Northern Hem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isphere," he said, "and probably some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your astronomers should have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon under observation. I have hopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they might see us and take warn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And they probably will," I cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bo-Kar seemed inclined to disagree</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that. "We're in the shadow," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "earth's shadow. Your planetary</seg><seg type="columnLine">home is hiding the sunlight from us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stared into the vision-plate. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said seemed only too true. Still I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered. There was an idea in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of my mind, if only I could sei2e</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hold it. Then in a flash it</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystallized.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're right, Bo-Kar," I said, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">then again you're wrong. We're so</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the earth's shadow that we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">in darkness, but, just stop and think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">94</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">this for the moment. If any observatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">has its telescope trained on the moon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface to-night we'll be seen, if not as</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves, at any rate as dark objects</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing swiftly across it. We'll be visi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble, if only by reason of what we ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scure in our passage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bo-Kar nodded. "That is so," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed. "I'd already thought of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a possibility. But what I doubt is</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether we will be recognizable. Will</seg><seg type="columnLine">the observer realize that we are really</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-ships? Is he not more likely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine that what he is seeing is due</seg><seg type="columnLine">either to a defect of his vision or of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescope, or even perhaps to some for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eign substance in the atmosphere through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, you remember, he is looking?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wre must appear very small, even in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">largest telescope."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could think of nothing to counter</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, and in the end agreed that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OUR upward course was still taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">us between the Moon and earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though both were now sinking away be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath us, and soon we were able to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">those two bodies and Ados itself occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pying the plane we had left. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetoid still glowed greenly; the haze</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself seemed to be pulsing, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres were nowhere to be seen. That,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, proved nothing. At this im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense distance they would appear in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credibly small anyway, and, if, following</seg><seg type="columnLine">our example with the earth, they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">got into the moon's shadow they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be invisible against the black background</seg><seg type="columnLine">of space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My own feeling, however, was that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">realizing we had the heels of them, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres had given up the pursuit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to their base. Bo-Kar was</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclined to agree with me in this, never-</seg><seg type="columnLine">theless he insisted that a strict watch be</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept from now on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Partly as a consequence of this in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">terruption and partly to conserve our</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuel and use the earth's attraction to</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw us forward, we swung into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet's orbital path. Actually it looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though we would meet head on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I knew the gravity screens wOuld</seg><seg type="columnLine">be called into operation in time to pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent any such catastrophe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A day or so later we entered the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere at an angle, and so swift was</seg><seg type="columnLine">our descent that we were hovering bare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly a thousand feet or so above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground before I quite realized where</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were. The place was unfamiliar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, but it was evident we were some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where either in the United States or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canada.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A word or two with Bo-Kar told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had happened. Recollecting what</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had told him, that the centres of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world's civilization lay in Europe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">North America, and that all other things</seg><seg type="columnLine">being equal we would prefer to land</seg><seg type="columnLine">amongst people of our own nationality</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had naturally chosen the largest con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinent available. He seemed quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud of the result and we had not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart to disabuse him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, even though we were not all</seg><seg type="columnLine">American, I could not see that it mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered much. The peril we had come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">warn the world against was {hat of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole planet, not of any one nation. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Martian, from a land where all bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riers of divergent nationalities and</seg><seg type="columnLine">languages had long been removed, any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other attitude would have seemed incom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehensible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fourteen ships, in a compact</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation now, were drifting slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">along. Our main side windows were</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, and we could see practically all</seg><seg type="columnLine">around us. Rettalick came in with Noma</seg><seg type="columnLine">just then, stared about him at the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">scape and gave an exclamation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Do you know where we are?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, and he nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've been here before," he said. "By</seg><seg type="columnLine">TERROR OUT OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">95</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the look of things we can't be far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned and said something to Bo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kar that I did not catch. Bo-Kar passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curt order or two over the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">municator, and slowly we began to rise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, as we found an upper level, headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost due east at a lively clip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Retallick had not been wrong. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">about an hour we sighted the city, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">another twenty minutes or so we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating gently above it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Martians gasped at the sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the first view any of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever had of a civilized city on earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the towering buildings and the teem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing multitudes must have stunned them</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentarily. We were close enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">now for people to see us. Traffic in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets began to tangle, and people to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stare up at us. I learnt afterwards that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were responsible for the biggest</seg><seg type="columnLine">traffic snarl and the greatest number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff necks in all history.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Retallick was making some prepara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions the sight of which made me ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he was going to do. He winked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm handling this end, Harper," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I worked on one of the papers</seg><seg type="columnLine">here once, and there may be some fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows about who still know me. We've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a story; we want it to go round the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world as quickly as possible, and I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusting to my ex-brothers of the Press</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do what they can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I noticed he did not mention the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the paper that had once claimed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">services, though, perhaps this was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well, for in the next breath he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to add certain libelous details that may</seg><seg type="columnLine">or may not be true.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how are you going to land?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">queried.

"The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Empire State building would be more</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectacular, of course, but the former's</seg><seg type="columnLine">better for our purpose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ' Can you do it--without danger, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded. "Of course. The grav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity screens will do what's necessary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anyway we've a bit of time to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it.

He held up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the finished product for me to read.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The message ran:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We, the undersigned, are Earthmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">who have been on a voyage to Mars in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Martian space-ship.

I could not rid</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind of the feeling that our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">story of Ados and its inhabitants was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite the maddest tale this world of ours</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever heard, and I expected nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than polite disbelief.

A year</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago I wouldn't have believed it myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of our doubts, however, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">set at rest when we saw Retallick shak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hands with several members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">group, and then presenting Norna to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. She was not as tall as the aver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age Martian, nevertheless in the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunic she wore after the fashion of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, she would have been a conspic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uous figure even if she hadn't been half</seg><seg type="columnLine">a head taller than the others there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently Retallick looked back to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards us and signalled the Roca to</seg><seg type="columnLine">TERROR OUT OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">97</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">descend and lower the ladder.

I counted half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen in all. Norna made them known</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us as they came on board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two of them were city officials,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose exact positions I have long since</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten; one was a newspaperman rep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">resenting a news-syndicate, the fourth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was introduced to me as Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mackin, I took to be a military man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort, but it was the other two who</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the deepest initial impression on</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Dr. Duncan and Professor Foster</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was told they were; they both seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists of some sort or other; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Foster, I could see at a glance, was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Englishman. Certainly New York must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have hustled to get six such men along</seg><seg type="columnLine">so quickly, but, actually, as I was pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently to learn, it was no mere accident</seg><seg type="columnLine">« r</seg><seg type="columnLine">that brought them together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stood in the doorway, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">interestedly about them after the intro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ductions until Retallick came on board.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, "This way, gentlemen, please," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, and led them into the observation</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. It looked more like the begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nings of a conference than the visit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspection I had anticipated, particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Retallick handed them all seats. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">communicating door was still open and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glancing back over my shoulder I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the ladder was being hauled on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board. A moment later the side-port</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed with a clang and the Roca be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to rise at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> None of the visitors seemed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least put out by that, though they must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been aware what was going on. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beginning to feel a trifle mystified</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, however, when Retallick cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air by calling across the room to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're off to Washington, Harper,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "and I'll have to take over con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">trol as our Martian friends don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">the course. Will you and Bo-Kar carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">on here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded. "All right," I said. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">what am I to do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Duncan looked up at me with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant smile. "Mr. Retallick has al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready given us a rough idea of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission here," he said easily. "May</seg><seg type="columnLine">I say at the start that it is a welcome one</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that seems likely to solve some mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious occurrences that have been per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbing us here of late?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How much," I said, "do you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">and how much don't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Putting it in a nutshell we know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you people have been to Mars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, and that in the interval you've dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered that behind that green haze</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seems to be arising in space on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible side of the moon is a malignant</seg><seg type="columnLine">entity that threatens the existence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our planet, no less than that of Mars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I tell you that several times with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the last year we have been visited by</seg><seg type="columnLine">calamities that we could only attribute</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an extra-terrestrial agency, you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand that we won't find your story</seg><seg type="columnLine">very difficult to believe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT was a good enough start for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. At least we were not going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be classed as liars or lunatics. Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duncan's mention of calamitous visita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions excited my curiosity, but I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided it was better to tell him what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know rather than waste time ask-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him questions that could very well</seg><seg type="columnLine">be dealt with later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had been more or less prepared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some such eventuality, and feeling that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would have to make my tale as com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pact as possible I had already pruned it</seg><seg type="columnLine">over in my own mind, so that when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">need arouse I was able to present the</seg><seg type="columnLine">salient facts as they affected earth, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">as little loss of time as possible. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather surprised at the reception ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">98</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">corded my story. It seemed they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite prepared to accept the possibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an inter-planetary invasion; they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">even prepared to admit the likelihood of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hitherto unsuspected form of life on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of the Moon turned away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from us; but, when I mentioned our sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond satellite for the first time, I saw ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressions of incredulity cross more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the faces opposite me. You see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for more than thirty years the possibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an intelligent and highly civilized race</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Mars had been discussed in public</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in private, and the world was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">or less used to envisaging such a thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it had never before been suggested,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as my knowledge went, that hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den behind our moon was a planetoid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any sort. I could see it would take some</seg><seg type="columnLine">work convincing my audience, but I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no intention of wasting words if I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">help it. The complete pictorial record</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had prepared against just such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">contingency was in readiness; the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights had been picked out, and the films</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves could be screened in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was only a step or two from where</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were to the projecting room, so I in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vited them along, merely stating that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could show them something that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">go further towards proving the truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my tale than any mere words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Noma, bless her heart, must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed from the beginning what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trend of things would be. She had one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Martian operators and a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jecting machine in readiness, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only a matter of selecting the rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ords that would give the most convinc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing pictures in the shortest possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Those of life on Mars, interest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as they were, I left for a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportune moment, concentrating simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">on such as had to do with Ados.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had the operator begin with those</seg><seg type="columnLine">we took early in our journey across</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, ones that showed conclusively</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the position Ados occupied in relation</seg><seg type="columnLine">to earth and the moon. As they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">screened I watched the faces of the six</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously, and gradually I saw a dawn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing conviction steal over one countenance</seg><seg type="columnLine">after another. It was when we came</seg><seg type="columnLine">within visual distance of Ados and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to show the green haze in its en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirety that I caught a simultaneous gasp</seg><seg type="columnLine">of amazement from the group. The ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect for them was no doubt heightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the fact that these Martian pictures</seg><seg type="columnLine">were taken and shown in their natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors. Not a thing was omitted. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the fleeing sphere disappear through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opening in the haze after that bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle in which one of the Martian ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become a casualty; then came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment when the haze opened again</seg><seg type="columnLine">to allow the fleet of spheres to stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in pursuit of us, and after that pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture followed a wide-angle shot show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing how nearly we were caught between</seg><seg type="columnLine">two fires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EVERY detail of that headlong flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ours was recorded there; our</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging around the moon, with shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">after shot of our cameras showing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vivid details of its surface; Ados van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishing behind the latter's silver bulk;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth gleaming roundly in space</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Foster turned to me as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirr of the projecting machine ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's convincing enough for me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Harper," he announced. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you say, Duncan?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other hesitated. He was an as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tronomer, not unknown to fame, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that such a man should find it hard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">recast the ideas of thirty years, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength of a few pictures, was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">understandable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think," he said slowly, "that Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harper has shown us enough to enable</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to verify the rest by calculation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">TERROR OUT OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">99</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment. Now we know what to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look for, no doubt we shall find it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greatest ease."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced at him sharply. I was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite sure that there wasn't an under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">current of sarcasm in his words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you're not inclined to be squeam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish," I said stiffly, "I can show you an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabitant of our second satellite, known</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its people as Ados."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What! Have you actually captured</seg><seg type="columnLine">one!" Captain Mackin asked in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise. Hitherto he had seemed more</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested in the battle of the rays than</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the new satellite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a live one," I told him. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians took this specimen from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere we fought with on our way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars. Of course he--and the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him--wrere dead before we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">get to them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Duncan turned and stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. "By your reckoning that must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost a year ago," he said. "I take</seg><seg type="columnLine">it he has--er--been preserved?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded. It was no time to go into</seg><seg type="columnLine">details, even if I knew them all. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian doctor in charge could tell the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two scientists all they wished to know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Accordingly I led the way to the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the dead Adosian had been kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">pending such an eventuality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Most of our officers could speak Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lish of a sort, they had picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from us, and those of them who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">most likely to make contact with peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple occupying similar positions on earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had devoted themselves assiduously dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the voyage to increasing their vocab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulary under Retallick's tutelage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Martian doctor spoke it in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quaint, clipped style, but, which was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main thing, he was able to make him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self understood without difficulty, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so demonstrate to the little party the</seg><seg type="columnLine">various peculiar features of the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adosian's anatomy, a task that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been altogether beyond my capacity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In addition, he had provided himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a number of photos that helped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">illustrate the matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Foster, who was something of a bi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ologist in addition to his other qual-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ifications, made some remark about</seg><seg type="columnLine">what an interesting subject for dissec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion the Adosian would make, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancy he expressed a hope that at some</seg><seg type="columnLine">future date the chance might be his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Martian doctor looked blankly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him for a second or so. Then:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You would wish to cut him up to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is inside him?" he said W'ith a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile. "But that is crude. If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish, you may see now--without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had forgotten that stethoscope thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">until I saw the Martian produce it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjusted it over Foster's face, placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eye-pieces in the right position, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "You would like to see your own</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Foster laughed uneasily. I fancy he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought some sort of a trick was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">played on him. However, he allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chest to be bared, and the Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed the other end of the instrument</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that it w'ould function. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment's strained silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God," Foster cried; "Duncan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can see inside myself just as if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrere made of glass!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">NONSENSE!" said the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You can't do that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doubting Thomas," said the Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lishman. "See for yourself." He took</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the apparatus and handed it to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">colleague.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duncan allowed it to be adjusted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he did make some remark about</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a fool of himself at his age.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A moment later came the change. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed the eye-pieces and looked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at us with a half-ashamed expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I apologize," he said contritely, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">100</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing was too incredible for words.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It still is. How do you do it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Martian doctor's black eyes twin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kled. "That," he said deliberately, "is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a secret, but one we shall have no hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation in giving to you earth peoples</seg><seg type="columnLine">should you prove worthy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But think of the revolution in diag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nosis," Foster murmured. "It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">abolish all the need of exploratory op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erations. Harper, have these Martians</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more surprises like this? This beats</seg><seg type="columnLine">the X-ray."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The planet's full of them," I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">extravagantly. "But I'd suggest you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a look at our Adosian friend first</seg><seg type="columnLine">or we'll be at Washington before we've</seg><seg type="columnLine">well begun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I left them in charge of the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tian doctor, who was far better fitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">than I to pilot them through the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amination. It was not the kind of thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could interest myself in, so I stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one side until they had finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Harper," said Duncan, coming back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me, "everything you have told us so</seg><seg type="columnLine">far has been borne out by what we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. From the build of this man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from what we have learned of his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ternal organs, we feel convinced that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has come from a planet where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull of gravity and the density of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere are nothing like as great</seg><seg type="columnLine">as those of either earth or Mars. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">how in the name of fortune they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to preserve him in this state</seg><seg type="columnLine">is more than I can say. Dead a year,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you say, and yet to all intents and pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poses he might merely be asleep. I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to know the method they employ to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get this result."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's another of their secrets that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'll probably tell you about later on,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said. "Once you've gained their con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidence, I don't think you'll find them</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all backward about sharing their</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge. But, gentlemen, you've al-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ready given me a hint that you in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn have something to tell us, and I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggest that we adjourn- to the observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion room again--the room where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the others, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," said Mackin, nodding;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you're quite in the dark as to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">locus standi in this affair. Yes, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be just as well for you to know with</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom you're dealing, and what exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">our particular powers are. You're not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the commander, I take it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shook my head. "Bo-Kar, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian to whom you were introduced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">commands the fleet, but his^interests are</seg><seg type="columnLine">ours, and he lias gone out of hi3 way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to trust us. But I think it is only due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him that whatever you have to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be said in his presence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly," Mackin agreed. "It's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer story, though. However, Foster</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Duncan know a good deal more</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the business than I do, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd better leave the telling to them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back in the observation room with</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of our party, save Retallick, united</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, we heard for the first time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story of the strange events of the past</seg><seg type="columnLine">year. As it was told to us each part</seg><seg type="columnLine">dovetailed into the other, and helped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a coherent whole to which we held</seg><seg type="columnLine">the key. But to the peoples of earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">it must have seemed no more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of isolated yet alarming inci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dents--showing no actual thread of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nection between them--that culminated</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last in that mysterious threat to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their existence, a threat that had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">them within a measurable distance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">realizing the imminence of the terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">that menaced them from out of space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TO begin with that descent of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roca, quite twelve months before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not passed unnoticed. A Sydney-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frisco liner had seen the strange light</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sky; one or two island schooners</seg><seg type="columnLine">had remarked on it on reaching port,</seg><seg type="columnLine">TERROR OUT OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">101</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and over on Florida Island some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officials had noted the sight and won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered what it was. It seems, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that among all those who saw it there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no one with any pretensions to</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific knowledge, and, when at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meagre details reached the astronom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical world, they could only conclude that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the manifestation had been due to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">extra large meteorite, and from the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no damage of any sort was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported it seemed obvious that it must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have fallen into the sea somewhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next act in the drama was a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectacular one. A section of the Brit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish fleet was at anchor off Portsmouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">one clear night, when a body resembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ball of dull light, as one observer de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribed it, suddenly made its appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sky at a height that was vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously estimated, quite probably errone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously in all instances, as from six hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred to a thousand feet. Almost cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly it was much higher. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently some doubt as to what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">object was and a searchlight from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the vessels was swung into the sky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a few seconds later the beams from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole fleet were focused on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing ball. Admitting that it was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adosian sphere, what happened next was</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly comprehensible. The Adosians,</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to the destructive power of rays, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt concluded that the harmless</seg><seg type="columnLine">searchlights were something new in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lethal line and, that being their convic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, preferred to take no chances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Observers on shore, from whose hazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">descriptions the account was subse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently compounded, agreed that a spurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">of green light seemed to come from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">object in the sky the moment the search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights picked it up, and for the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">few seconds nothing could be seen in</seg><seg type="columnLine">detail. A great portion of the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed incontinently to turn to steam;</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of explosions occurred in quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">succession, and brilliant lights flashed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and went out and flashed again through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steam cloud. When it finally cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">away there vas no sign either of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">battleships themselves or of the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sky. They had absolutely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely vanished.

Bo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kar, speaking for himself, wished to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that, rather than face out the wran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling and the petty differences between</seg><seg type="columnLine">nations that seemed the order of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, he would withdraw his people and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ships, sail away into the void and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave earth to fend for itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Retallick finished, and turned to Bo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kar as though he thought the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">might still have more to say.

"I shall see you through."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In that he showed he was a judge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, whether they came from earth or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars, but after all he was only half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second ahead of it. He had no sooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished speaking than one of the Brit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish delegates jumped to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr--er--Bo-Kar is right, gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men," he declared. "We're fiddling</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Rome is burning. What do our</seg><seg type="columnLine">petty jealousies matter in the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this larger menace? Indeed I say that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if in the end it can weld us into one</seg><seg type="columnLine">people with one heart and one aim, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">lias not been without its uses."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think," said the President smiling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that we are all agreed on that, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would suggest we should ask our Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tian friend that such of his picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">records as can be shown here, be brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">in at once for our conviction."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tide had definitely turned; there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no doubt about that, and Bo-Kar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensing something of it, stared frankly</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewildered at the change of expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the faces of those in front of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could not understand people who</seg><seg type="columnLine">refused to face facts, yet could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed so easily this way and that by</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, to make a long story short, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture records were brought in, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">given a complete screening. Before, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Roca, for the benefit of Duncan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Foster and their colleagues we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely picked out the high lights, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">now everything we could screen was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown from end to end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The screening itself took several hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but from start to finish the audience</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat enthralled, and when it came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle in the void, from more than one</seg><seg type="columnLine">came gasps of amazement, and, I im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agine, fear. It was then that Mackin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was sitting next to me, turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Harper," he said, "I think I see</seg><seg type="columnLine">now why these Adosians of yours at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked the British fleet and destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Statue of Liberty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why?" I asked. So far I had failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to trace any logical connection between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two incidents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"TT'S quite simple," he said. "Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">A chief weapon is the ray, and nat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urally they regard anything of similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature as a possible weapon of offense.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They attacked the British fleet because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its searchlights, and the beam from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lantern on the Statue of Liberty</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt seemed to their minds to pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sess lethal possibilities also. So they</seg><seg type="columnLine">got in first."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed quite a feasible solution, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said so. Also, it appeared to me it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be good policy to cut out every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in the nature of a swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam as long as there was a likelihood</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an attack by the Adosians. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean that a lot of light-houses would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to go out of business, but no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipping could be warned of what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mackin nodded at my suggestion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Much the same idea had come to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he admitted. At any rate, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">put it up to the proper authorities and</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that they carried it through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The exhibition came to a close, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a time a death-like silence fell on</seg><seg type="columnLine">us all. Again it was one of the Brit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish delegates, the same who had spoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, who forced the issue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">TERROR OUT OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">107</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think/' he said, "we have seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to convince us. The reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">why this planetoid, Ados, has not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered before I leave to one more</seg><seg type="columnLine">competent than I, but from what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been told I should imagine that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it has already manifested its presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our astronomers, though possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have drawn wrong deductions from</seg><seg type="columnLine">those manifestations. I am given to un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand, however, that its density is</seg><seg type="columnLine">very low and possibly, therefore, such</seg><seg type="columnLine">influences of an attractive nature as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">exerts on our planet have been hitherto</seg><seg type="columnLine">negligible. But it was not of that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to speak. I am taking it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">granted that we are now of one mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I cannot imagine how anyone could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seen what we have seen and heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">what we have heard, and remain uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced. That being so, I would ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">that our Martian friends advance some</seg><seg type="columnLine">formal suggestion as to a plan of cam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paign."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bo-Kar had followed the Englishman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech with close attention, and, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not understand himself, Retallick</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made plain, and now at the end he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke again, once more apologizing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his inadequate knowledge of the lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guage. What he had to say was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as simple and direct as before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw no gain, he said, in sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and waiting for the Adosians to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the initiative. They had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">given ample evidence of hostile inten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. Therefore, he suggested, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we carry the war into the enemy's coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try. One, of course, could not say</seg><seg type="columnLine">how many of the spheres were in ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istence, and the vibratory screen about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ados, too, presented a difficulty, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter was a problem that the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bined wits of the Martians and earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists could no doubt overcome. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">own men would be happy to begin</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimenting in collaboration with</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth scientists practically at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for space-ships, fifteen of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian vessels were now on earth;</seg><seg type="columnLine">others were setting out from their home</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet and should be here soon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more would be commissioned as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were built. They could be built readily</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough here on earth from the plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would supply. If the work was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed on and every effort concentrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it, there was no reason why a fleet</seg><seg type="columnLine">should not be ready to take off inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">of three months. Meanwhile some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Martian ships could be manned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">commanded by earth-men. Every mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of the earth party, who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Mars, had undergone a course of</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruction that made them capable of</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking complete charge of a space-ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth crews could be put through train-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in a week that would fit them for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their duties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Understand," he went on, "that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Roca, for so we call our planet which</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know as Mars, are giving you of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">secrets and our discoveries. We merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask that they be made common to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peoples of this world, not that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be held by one or two nations</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. And in return there is one thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">we seek. ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused and looked around before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went on, as if to feel in advance</seg><seg type="columnLine">the temper of the gathering towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposition he meant to submit. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">this moment I had dreaded all along,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I need not have worried. Retallick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he must have talked the matter over</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all its possible aspects and implica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, for:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">WHO owns the Moon?" Bo-Kar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">asked abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">For a space there was silence. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine that it was a question which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot at them in that fashion, took more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than one of the delegates aback.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why," said one of the Englishmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, "nobody does, unless there hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">108</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pen to be any inhabitants there, in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">case their right is surely incontestable."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess," said one of the American</seg><seg type="columnLine">delegates drily, "that whoever lands there</seg><seg type="columnLine">first will certainly claim it for his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. It's not so near or so valuable</seg><seg type="columnLine">that anyone will dispute that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So I thought," said Bo-Kar, catch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing: at the sense rather than at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">actual words themselves. "Well, know</seg><seg type="columnLine">you Earth-men that we of Roca have</seg><seg type="columnLine">interests in your moon. We have al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready effected a landing there, and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered minerals of which there is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortage on Mars, and which we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">work for our own benefit. So now this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is my bargain, that in return for what</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are ready to do to help you, we be</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed undisputed right to work now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hereafter all such mineral depos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">its as we may discover on that side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the moon remote from earth. Should</seg><seg type="columnLine">you earth-men wish to work similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">deposits on this face of the Moon, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not come into conflict with each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sounds fair enough," said one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Americans. "It's pretty much of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a no-man's-land anyway, I should say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if you people can find a way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting over the lack of atmosphere and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the difficulties of temperature, I, for one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would say, go to it. It looks to me,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">too, as though this meeting's going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be unanimous on the matter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I imagine," said the President su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">avely, "that what we are going to gain</seg><seg type="columnLine">from intercourse with our Martian allies</seg><seg type="columnLine">will far outweigh the value of any con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessions they desire on the moon. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, it isn't our exclusive property;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far, no nation on earth has ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempted to lay claim to it, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">we shouldn't make a virtue of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnanimous over what isn't ours to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give. If the doctrine of priority of</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupation counts for anything, I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Martians have a better right to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">than we have. At the worst we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that if they care to work any de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posits they may find on the moon within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the limits they themselves have set, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">need anticipate no interference from us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That, I think, will meet with every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's approval."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seemingly, when a vote was taken, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">did. The trouble, if any, would come</seg><seg type="columnLine">later when the full extent of the moon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mineral wealth had been ascertained be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond all possibility of doubt. Meanwhile</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had reached the stage when the rep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">resentatives of most of the powers that</seg><seg type="columnLine">counted had become convinced that</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth was facing a very real and pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing danger, that must be dealt with be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore it assumed proportions with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could not cope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">End of Part III</seg><seg type="columnLine">109</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Cfold-'Bug</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  By EDGAR ALLAN POE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  [1843]</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       What ho! what ho! this fellow is dancing mad 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       He hath been bitten by the Tarantula.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                            All in the Wrong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MANY years ago, I con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted an intimacy with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. William Legrand. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was of an ancient Hugue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">not family, and had once</seg><seg type="columnLine">been wealthy; but a series of misfor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunes had reduced him to want. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid the mortification consequent upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his disasters, he left New Orleans, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city of his forefathers, and took up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">residence at Sullivan's Island, near</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charleston, South Carolina.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This island is a very singular one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It consists of little else than the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand, and is about three miles long. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">breadth at no point exceeds a quarter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mile. It is separated from the main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land by a scarcely perceptible creek, ooz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing its way through a wilderness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeds and slime, a favorite resort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marsh-hen. The vegetation, as might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be supposed, is scant, or at least dwarf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish. No trees of any magnitude are to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seen. Near the western extremity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Fort Moultrie stands, and where</seg><seg type="columnLine">are some miserable frame buildings, ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anted, during summer, by the fugitives</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Charleston dust and fever, may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be found, indeed, the bristly palmetto;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the whole island, with the exception</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this western point, and a line of hard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white beach on the seacoast, is covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a dense undergrowth of the sweet</seg><seg type="columnLine">myrtle, so much prized by the horticul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turists of England. The shrub here</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">often attains the height of fifteen or</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty feet, and forms an almost im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrable coppice, burthening the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its fragrance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the inmost recessor of this cop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pice, not far from the eastern or more</seg><seg type="columnLine">remote end of the island, Legrand had</seg><seg type="columnLine">built himself a small hut, which he oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupied when I first, by mere accident,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his acquaintance. This soon ripened</seg><seg type="columnLine">into friendship--for there was much in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the recluse to excite interest and es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teem. I found him well educated, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual powers of mind, but infected</seg><seg type="columnLine">with misanthropy, and subject to per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse moods of alternate enthusiasm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">melancholy. He had with him many</seg><seg type="columnLine">books, but rarely employed them. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief amusements were gunning and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fishing, or sauntering along the beach</seg><seg type="columnLine">and through the myrtles, in quest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shells or entomological specimens; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">collection of the latter might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">envied by a Swammerdamm. In these</seg><seg type="columnLine">excursions he was usually accompanied</seg><seg type="columnLine">by an old negro, called Jupiter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been manumitted before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reserves of the family, but who could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be induced, neither by threats nor by</seg><seg type="columnLine">promises, to abandon what he consid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered his right of attendance upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">footsteps of his young "Massa Will."</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is not improbable that the relatives of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Legrand, conceiving him to be somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsettled in intellect, had contrived to</seg><seg type="columnLine">110</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">instill this obstinacy into Jupiter, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a view to the supervision and guardian-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship of the wanderer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The winters in the latitude of Sulli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">van's Island are seldom very severe, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the fall of the year it is a rare event</seg><seg type="columnLine">even indeed when a fire is considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary. About the middle of Octo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber, 18--, there occurred, however, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">day of remarkable chilliness. Just be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore sunset I scrambled my way through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evergreens to the hut of my friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom I had not visited for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks--my residence being, at that time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Charleston, a distance of nine miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the island, where the facilities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage and re-passage were far behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of the present day. Upon reach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the hut I rapped, as was my custom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and getting no reply, sought for the key</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I knew it was secreted, unlocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door and went in. A fine fire was</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing upon the hearth. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">novelty, and by no means an ungrateful</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. I threw off an overcoat, took an</seg><seg type="columnLine">armchair by the crackling logs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaited patiently the arrival of my hosts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon after dark they arrived, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave me a most cordial welcome. Jup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iter, grinning from ear to ear, bustled</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to prepare some marsh-hens for</seg><seg type="columnLine">supper. Legrand was in one of his fits</seg><seg type="columnLine">--how else shall I term them?--of en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thusiasm. He had found an unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">bivalve, forming a new genus, and, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than this, he had hunted down and se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cured, with Jupiter's assistance, a scar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abaus which he believed to be totally</seg><seg type="columnLine">new, but in respect to which he wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have my opinion on the morrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And why not to-night ?" I asked, rub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing my hands over the blaze and wish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the whole tribe of scarabcei at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, if I had only known you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">here!" said Legrand, "but it's so long</seg><seg type="columnLine">since I saw you; and how could I fone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that you would pay me a visit this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">very night of all others? As I was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">coming home I met Lieutenant G-,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from the fort, and, very foolishly, I lent</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the bug; So it will be impossible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to see it until morning.

He looked for some in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawer, but found none.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind," said he at length, "this</seg><seg type="columnLine">will answer;" and he drew from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">waistcoat pocket a scrap of what I took</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be very dirty foolscap, and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it a rough drawing with the pen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While he did this, I retained my seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the fire, for I was still chilly. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the design was complete, he handed it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me without rising.

When</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gambols were over, I looked at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper, and, to speak the truth, found</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself not a little puzzled at what my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend had depicted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well!" I said, after contemplating</seg><seg type="columnLine">it for some minutes, "this is a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarabceus, I must confess: new to me:</seg><seg type="columnLine">never saw any thing like it before--</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless it was a skull, or a death's-head</seg><seg type="columnLine">--which it more nearly resembles than</seg><seg type="columnLine">any thing else that has come under my</seg><seg type="columnLine">observation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A death's-head!" echoed Legrand</seg><seg type="columnLine">--"Oh--yes--well, it has something of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that appearance upon paper, no doubt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two upper black spots look like</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, eh? and the longer one at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom like a mouth--and then the shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the whole is oval."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps so," said I; "but, Legrand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I fear you are no artist.

Why, we may get up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very thrilling bit of superstition upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">this hint. I presume you will call the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bug scarabceus caput homhiis, or some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of that kind--there are many sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilar titles in the Natural Histories.

In an instant his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face grew violently red--in another as</seg><seg type="columnLine">excessively pale. For some minutes he</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to scrutinize the drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutely where he sat. At length he</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose, took a candle from the table, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded to seat himself upon a sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest in the farthest corner of the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here again he made an anxious examina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the paper; turning it in all direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions.

Presently he took from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his coat pocket a wallet, placed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper carefully in it, and deposited both</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a writing-desk, which he locked. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">now grew more composed in his de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meanour; but his original air of enthu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siasm had quite disappeared.

His demeanor was dogged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the extreme, and "dat d--d bug"</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the sole words which escaped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips during the journey. For my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">part, I had charge of a couple of dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">lanterns, while Legrand contented him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self with the scarabaus, which he car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried attached to the end of a bit of whip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord; twirling it to and fro, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air of a conjuror, as he went. When I</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed this last, plain evidence of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend's aberration of mind, I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely refrain from tears. I thought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">best, however, to humor his fancy, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least for the present, or until I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">adopt some more energetic measures</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a chance of success. In the mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I endeavored, but all in vain, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound him in regard to the object of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expedition. Having succeeded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">inducing me to accompany him, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed unwilling to hold conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon any topic of minor importance, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all my questions vouchsafed no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply than "we shall see!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We crossed the creek at the head of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island by means of a skiff, and, as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cending the high grounds on the shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the main land, proceeded in a north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">westerly direction, through a tract of</seg><seg type="columnLine">country excessively wild and desolate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where no trace of a human footstep was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be seen.

When we reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">this tree, Legrand turned to Jupiter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and asked him if he thought he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb it. The old man seemed a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered by the question, and for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments made no reply. At length he</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached the huge trunk, walked slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly around it, and examined it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute attention.

Little</seg><seg type="columnLine">was said; and our chief embarrassment</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay in the yelpings of the dog, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">took exceeding interest in our proceed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings. He, at length, became so ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">streperous that we grew fearful of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving the alarm to some stragglers in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vicinity; or, rather, this was the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehension of Legrand; for myself, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have rejoiced at any interruption</seg><seg type="columnLine">which might have enabled me to get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanderer home. The noise was, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">length, very effectively silenced by Jup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iter, who, getting out of the hole with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dogged air of deliberation, tied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute's mouth up with one of his sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">penders, and then returned, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave chuckle, to his task.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the time mentioned had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pired, we had reached a depth of five</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, and yet no signs of any treasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">became manifest. A general pause en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sued, and I began to hope that the farce</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at an end. Legrand, however, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though evidently much disconcerted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiped his brow thoughtfully and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLD-BUG</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">119</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">commenced. We had excavated the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire circle of four feet diameter, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now we slightly enlarged the limit, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the farther depth of two feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still nothing appeared. The gold-seek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er, whom I sincerely pitied, at length</seg><seg type="columnLine">clambered from the pit, with the bit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest disappointment imprinted upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">every feature, and proceeded, slowly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reluctantly, to put on his coat, which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had thrown off at the beginning of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor. In the mean time I made no re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark. Jupiter, at a signal from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">master, began to gather up his tools.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This done, and the dog having been</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmuzzled, we turned in profound</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence towards home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had taken, perhaps, a dozen steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this direction, when, with a loud oath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Legrand strode up to Jupiter, and seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">him by the collar. The astonished negro</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened his eyes and mouth to the fullest</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent, let fall the spades, and fell upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You scoundrel," said Legrand, hiss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out the syllables from between his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched teeth--"you infernal black vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lain !--speak, I tell you!--answer me</seg><seg type="columnLine">this instant, without prevarication!--</seg><seg type="columnLine">which--which is your left eye?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, my golly, Massa Will! aint dis</seg><seg type="columnLine">here my lef eye for sartain?" roared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrified Jupiter, placing his hand upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right organ of vision, and holding it</seg><seg type="columnLine">there with a desperate pertinacity, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">in immediate dread of his master's at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt at a gouge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought so!--I knew it!--hurrah!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">vociferated Legrand, letting the negro</seg><seg type="columnLine">go, and executing a series of curvets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caracols, much to the astonishment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his valet, who, arising from his knees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked, mutely, from his master to my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, and then from myself to his mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come! we must go back," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter, "the game's not up yet;" and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">again led the way to the tulip-tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jupiter," said he, when we reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">its foot, "come here! was the skull nailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the limb with the face outwards, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the face to the limb?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "De face was out, massa, so dat de</seg><seg type="columnLine">crows could get at de eyes good, witdout</seg><seg type="columnLine">any trouble."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, then, was it this eye or that</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which you let the beetle fall?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">--here Legrand touched each of Jupi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter's eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Twas dis eye, massa--de lef eye--jis</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you told me," and here it was his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye that the negro indicated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That will do--we must try again."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here my friend, about whose madness</seg><seg type="columnLine">I now saw, or fancied that I saw, cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain indications of method, removed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peg which marked the spot where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetle fell, to a spot about three inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the westward of its former position.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taking, now, the tape-measure from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest point of the trunk to the peg,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as before, and continuing the extension in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a straight line to the distance of fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, a spot was indicated, removed, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">several yards, from the point at which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been digging.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Around the new position a circle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat larger than in the former in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance, was now described, and we again</seg><seg type="columnLine">set to work with the spades. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreadfully weary, but, scarcely under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing what had occasioned the change</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my thoughts, I felt no longer any</seg><seg type="columnLine">great aversion from the labor imposed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had become most unaccountedly inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested--nay, even excited. Perhaps there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something, amid all the extravagant</seg><seg type="columnLine">demeanor of Legrand--some air of fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, or of deliberation, which im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed me. I dug eagerly, and now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then caught myself actually looking, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that very much resembled ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectation, for the fancied treasure, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision of which had demented my unfor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunate companion. At a period when</seg><seg type="columnLine">such vagaries of thought most fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">120</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed me, and when we had been at</seg><seg type="columnLine">work perhaps an hour and a half, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were again interrupted by the violent</seg><seg type="columnLine">howlings of the dog. His uneasiness, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first instance, had been, evidently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the result of playfulness or caprice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he now assumed a bitter and serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone. Upon Jupiter's again attempting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to muzzle him, he made furious resis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance, and, leaping into the hole, tore up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mould frantically with his claws. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few seconds he had uncovered a mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">human bones, forming two complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">skeletons, intermingled with several but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tons of metal, and what appeared to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dust of decayed woollen. One or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">strokes of a spade upturned the blade of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large Spanish knife, and, as we dug</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther, three or four loose pieces of gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and silver coin came to light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At sight of these the joy of Jupiter</seg><seg type="columnLine">could scarcely be restrained, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenance of his master wore an air of</seg><seg type="columnLine">extreme disappointment. He urged us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, to continue our exertions, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words were hardly uttered when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled and fell forward, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the toe of my boot in a large ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">of iron that lay half buried in the loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We now worked in earnest, and never</seg><seg type="columnLine">did I pass ten minutes of more intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement. During this interval we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly unearthed an oblong chest of wood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, from its perfect preservation, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful hardness, had plainly been</seg><seg type="columnLine">subjected to some mineralizing process</seg><seg type="columnLine">--perhaps that of the Bichloride of Mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cury. This box was three and a half feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, three feet broad, and two and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half feet deep. It was firmly secured by</seg><seg type="columnLine">bands of wrought iron, riveted, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming a kind of trellis-work over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole. On each side of the chest, near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top, were three rings of iron--six in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all--by means of which a firm hold could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be obtained by six persons. Our utmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">united endeavors served only to disturb</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the coffer very slightly in its bed. We at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once saw the impossibility of removing</seg><seg type="columnLine">so great a weight. Luckily, the sole fast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enings of the lid consisted of two sliding</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolts. These we drew back--trembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and panting with anxiety. In an instant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a treasure of incalculable value lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming before us. As the rays of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lanterns fell within the pit, there flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upwards, from a confused heap of gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of jewels, a glow and a glare that</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely dazzled our eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shall not pretend to describe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feelings with which I gazed. Amazement</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, of course, predominant. Legrand</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared exhausted with excitement, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke very few words. Jupiter's counte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nance wore, for some minutes, as deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pallor as it is possible, in the nature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things, for any negro's visage to as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sume. He seemed stupefied--thunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken. Presently he fell upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees in the pit, and, burying his naked</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms up to the elbows in gold, let them</seg><seg type="columnLine">there remain, as if enjoying the luxury of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bath. At length, with a deep sigh, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed, as if in a soliloquy,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And dis all cum ob de goole-bug! de</seg><seg type="columnLine">putty goole-bug! de poor little goole-bug,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I boosed in dat sabage kind ob</seg><seg type="columnLine">style! Aint you shamed ob yourself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nigger?--answer me dat!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It became necessary, at last, that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should arouse both master and valet to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expediency of removing the treasure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was growing late, and it behooved us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make exertion, that we might get</seg><seg type="columnLine">every thing housed before daylight. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was difficult to say what should be done;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and much time was spent in deliberation</seg><seg type="columnLine">--so confused were the ideas of all. We,</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally, lightened the box by removing</seg><seg type="columnLine">two thirds of its contents, when we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">enabled, with some trouble, to raise it</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the hole. The articles taken out</seg><seg type="columnLine">were deposited among the brambles, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dog left to guard them, with strict</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders from Jupiter neither, upon any</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLD-BUG</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">121</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pretence, to stir from the spot, nor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">open his mouth until our return. We then</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurriedly made for home with the chest;</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching the hut in safety, but after ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessive toil, at one o'clock in the morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Worn out as we were, it was not in</seg><seg type="columnLine">human nature to do more just then. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested until two, and had supper; start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for the hills immediately afterwards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed with three stout sacks, which, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">good luck, were upon the premises. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">little before four we arrived at the pit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">divided the remainder of the booty as</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally as might be, among us, and, leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the holes unfilled, again set out for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut, at which, for the second time, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">deposited our golden burthens, just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first streaks of the dawn gleamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the tree-tops in the east.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were now thoroughly broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">down; but in the intense excitement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time denied us repose. After an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unquiet slumber of some three or four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours' duration, we arose, as if by pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">concert, to make examination of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chest had been full to the brim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we spent the whole day, and, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater part of the next night, in a scru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny of its contents. There had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing like order or arrangement. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing had been heaped in promiscuously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Having assorted all with care, we found</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves possessed of even vaster wealth</seg><seg type="columnLine">than we had at first supposed. In coin</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was rather more than four hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fifty thousand dollars--estimating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">value of the pieces, as accurately at we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could, by the tables of the period. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a particle of silver. All was gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">of antique date and of great variety--</seg><seg type="columnLine">French, Spanish, and German money,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a few English guineas, and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">counters, of which we had never seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimens before. There were several</seg><seg type="columnLine">large and heavy coins, so worn that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could make nothing of their inscrip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. There was no American money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The value of the jewels we found more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty in estimating. There were dia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monds--some of them exceedingly large</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fine--a hundred and ten in all, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not one of them small; eighteen rubies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable brilliancy; three hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten emeralds, all very beautiful; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-one sapphires, with an opal. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones had all been broken from their set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tings and thrown loose in the chest. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">settings themselves, which we picked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from among the other gold, appeared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been beaten up with hammers, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prevent identification. Besides all this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a vast quantity of solid gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">ornaments; nearly two hundred massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger and ear rings; rich chains--thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these, if I remember; eighty-three very</seg><seg type="columnLine">large and heavy crucifixes; five gold cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sers of great value; a prodigious golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">punch-bowl, ornamented with richly</seg><seg type="columnLine">chased vine-leaves and Bacchanalian fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures ; with two sword-handles exquis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itely embossed, and many other smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">articles which I cannot recollect. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of these valuables exceeded three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in this estimate I have not included</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hundred and ninety-seven superb</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold watches; three of the number be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing worth five hundred dollars, if one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many of them were very old, and as time-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keepers valueless; the works having suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered, more or less, from corrosion--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but all were richly jewelled and in cases</seg><seg type="columnLine">of great worth. We estimated the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire contents of the chest, that night, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a million and a half of dollars; and, upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the subsequent disposal of the trinkets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and jewels (a few being retained for our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own use), it was found that we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly undervalued the treasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When, at length, we had concluded</seg><seg type="columnLine">our examination, and the intense ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement of the time had, in some meas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure, subsided, Legrand, who saw that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dying with impatience for a solution</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this most extraordinary riddle, entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">122</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">into a full detail of all the circumstances</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You remember," said he, "the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I handed you the rough sketch I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of the scarabceus, You recollect</seg><seg type="columnLine">also, that I became quite vexed at you</seg><seg type="columnLine">for insisting that my drawing resembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">a death's-head. When you first made this</seg><seg type="columnLine">assertion I thought you were jesting; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterwards I called to mind the peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">spots on the back of the insect, and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted to myself that your remark had</seg><seg type="columnLine">some little foundation in fact. Still, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneer at my graphic powers irritated me</seg><seg type="columnLine">--for I am considered a good artist--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, therefore, when you handed me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrap of parchment, I was about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumple it up and throw it angrily into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The scrap of paper, you mean," said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No; it had much of the appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of paper, and at first I supposed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be such, but when I came to draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it, I discovered it, at once, to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a piece of very thin parchment. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite dirty, you remember. Well, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was in the very act of crumpling it up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my glance fell upon the sketch at which</seg><seg type="columnLine">you had been looking, and you may</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine my astonishment when I per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived, in fact, the figure of a death's-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head just where, it seemed to me, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made the drawing of the beetle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a moment, I was too much amazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think with accuracy. I knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my design was very different in detail</seg><seg type="columnLine">from this--although there was a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">similarity in general outline. Presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">I took a candle, and seating myself at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other end of the room, proceeded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutinize the parchment more closely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Upon turning it over, I saw my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">sketch upon the reverse, just as I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it. My first idea, now, was mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise at the really remarkable sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilarity of outline--at the singular co-</seg><seg type="columnLine">incidence involved in the fact, that un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">known to me, there should have been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">skull upon the other side of the parch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, immediately beneath my figure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scarabceus, and that this skull, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only in outline, but in size, should so</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely resemble my drawing. I say the</seg><seg type="columnLine">singularity of this coincidence abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely stupefied me for a time. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the usual effect of such coincidences.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The mind struggles to establish a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nexion--a sequence of cause and effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and, being unable to do so, suffers a</seg><seg type="columnLine">species of temporary paralysis. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I recovered from this stupor, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawned upon me gradually a conviction</seg><seg type="columnLine">which startled me even far more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coincidence. I began distinctly, pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itively, to remember that there had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been no drawing on the parchment when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I made my sketch of the scarabceus. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">became perfectly certain of this; for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">recollected turning up first one side and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the other, in search of the clean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est spot. Had the skull been there, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course I could not have failed to notice</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Here was indeed a mystery which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt it impossible to explain; but, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that early moment, there seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimmer, faithfully, within the most re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mote and secret chambers of my intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lect, a glow-worm-like conception of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that truth which last night's adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought to so magnificent a demonstra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. I arose at once, and putting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parchment securely away, dismissed all</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther reflection until I should be alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When you had gone, and when Jupi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter was fast asleep, I betook myself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a more methodical investigation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair. In the first place I considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the manner in which the parchment had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come into my possession. The spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we discovered the scarabceus was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the coast of the main land, about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile eastward of the island, and but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short distance above high water mark.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Upon my taking hold of it, it gave me</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sharp bite, which caused me to let</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLD-BUG</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">123</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it drop. Jupiter, with his accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">caution, before seizing the insect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had flown towards him, looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him for a leaf, or something of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that nature, by which to take hold of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was at this moment that his eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mine also, fell upon the scrap of</seg><seg type="columnLine">parchment, which I then supposed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper. It was lying half buried in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand, a corner sticking up. Near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot where we found it, I observed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remnants of the hull of what appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have been a ship's long boat. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck seemed to have been there for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very great while; for the resemblance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat timbers could scarcely be traced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Jupiter picked up the parch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, wrapped the beetle in it, and gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to me. Soon afterwards we turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go home, and on the way met Lieutenant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">G-. I showed him the insect, and he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">begged me to let him take it to the fort.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On my consenting, he thrust it forthwith</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his waistcoat pocket, without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parchment in which it had been wrapped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and which I had continued to hold in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hand during his inspection. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps he dreaded my changing my mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thought it best to make sure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prize at once--you know how enthu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siastic he is on all subjects connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Natural History. At the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, without being conscious of it, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have deposited the parchment in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You remember that when I went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table, for the purpose of making a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sketch of the beetle, I found no paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it was usually kept. I looked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drawer, and found none there. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched my pockets, hoping to find an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old letter--and then my hand fell upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parchment. I thus detail the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cise mode in which it came into my</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession; for the circumstances im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed me with peculiar force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No doubt you will think me fanciful</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but I had already established a kind of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">connexion. I had put together two links</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a great chain. There was a boat ly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on a sea-coast, and not far from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat was a parchment--not a paper--</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a skull depicted on it. You will, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, ask 'where is the connexion?' I</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply that the skull, or death's head, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the well-known emblem of the pirate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The flag of the death's-head is hoisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all engagements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have said that the scrap was parch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and not paper.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflection suggested some meaning--</seg><seg type="columnLine">some relevancy--in the death's-head. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not fail to observe, also, the form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parchment. Although one of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners had been, by some accident, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed, it could be seen that the original</seg><seg type="columnLine">form was oblong.

I reasoned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for example, thus: When I drew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarabcews, there was no skull apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the parchment.

The weather was chilly</seg><seg type="columnLine">(oh rare and happy accident!), and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire was blazing on the hearth. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">heated with exercise and sat near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table. You, however, had drawn a chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the chimney. Just as I placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parchment in your hand, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were in the act of inspecting it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wolf, the Newfoundland, entered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped upon your shoulders. With your</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hand you caressed him and kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">him off, while your right, holding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parchment, was permitted to fall list-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly between your knees, and in close</seg><seg type="columnLine">proximity to the fire. At one moment I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought the blaze had caught it, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to caution you, but, before I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak, you had withdrawn it, and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">re-engaged in its examination. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">I considered all these particulars, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubted not for a moment that heat had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the agent in bringing to light, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parchment, the skull which I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">designed on it. You are well aware that</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemical preparations exist, and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">existed time out of mind, by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it is possible to write on either</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper or vellum, so that the characters</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall become visible only when subjected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the action of fire. Zaffre, digested</seg><seg type="columnLine">in aqua regia, and diluted with four</seg><seg type="columnLine">times its weight of water, is sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">employed; a green tint results. The reg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulus of cobalt, dissolved in spirit of nitre,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gives a red. These colors disappear at</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer or shorter intervals after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">material written cools, but again become</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent upon the re-application of heat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I now scrutinized the death's head</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with care.

First of all I wish to offer</seg><seg type="columnLine">my appreciation and congratulations on your</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canadian Branch of Amazing Stories. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">enables many ardent followers of your maga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zine over here to avail ourselves of this oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity to continue reading Amazing Stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, otherwise would be denied us. I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">otherwise, because, on account of the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canadian tariff wall, coupled with the depre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciation of the Canadian dollar, we were un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to purchase direct from the U.S.A., that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">from publisher to reader. I can safely state</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you, yourselves, have been quite aware of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this fact for the past two years or more when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you found Canadian sales dropping off. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">stands to reason that the average reader can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">not afford to pay thirty-five cents or more for</seg><seg type="columnLine">one copy of any magazine during such times</seg><seg type="columnLine">of depression, therefore, the dealers were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolish enough to stock them.

Of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is every person's right to have his or her</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual opinions. But, personally I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is a gross injustice to attack the authors and</seg><seg type="columnLine">artists. Some people evidently have a very poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of imagination and practicability. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">have little comprehension of the vast account</seg><seg type="columnLine">of imagination and concentration necessary for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an author to pen his ideas, situations and char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acters to paper, especially if the narration hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pens to be science fiction, which calls for alto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether different and novel constructions. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">science fiction author is a scientist, inventor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer, historian, etc., if not in fact then</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely in knowledge. So we can see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">obstacles such an author would encounter and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be human if he did not make an</seg><seg type="columnLine">error, theoretically or factually, once in a while.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is the same with artists, and I for one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indignantly resent Miss (I presume) Margaret</seg><seg type="columnLine">Young's statement: "I do not like Morey's illus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trations." It was rather a blunt and candid</seg><seg type="columnLine">statement, and to the point. But first, be it</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood that I am not criticising the Ohio</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady's view-point; far be it from me to argue</seg><seg type="columnLine">with any member of the fair sex--any man</seg><seg type="columnLine">should know better. But it is true that I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">resent her statement in regard to Mr. Morey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have no idea what other works of art Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morey is engaged in, but it is a certainty that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his illustrations in the magazine are more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthy of praise and deserve a great deal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">credit. The work of a scientific artist is even</seg><seg type="columnLine">more difficult than that of the author. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">author is fore-armed with the knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he is going to create, therefore his work</seg><seg type="columnLine">is that much simpler, whereas, on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, the artist is not, and has to create</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentally from what he reads in the story, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">often as not, is insufficient in details. He has</seg><seg type="columnLine">to transfer that mental image to reality on paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fit the author's conception of it as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as possible. He does not paint to suit himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Ae readers as much as he wants to faithfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">portray the author's original thought. If his</seg><seg type="columnLine">creations are monstrosities and impossibilities</seg><seg type="columnLine">we should not criticise him, because he is paint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing only what is required of him by the story.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If we continue to criticise the artists they might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be withdrawn, and if the illustrations are cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, the magazine would not be half as inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Regarding the stories themselves I can safely</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that seventy-five percent, of them are ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptionally good in plot, construction and scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific data. Where most of them fall down is</seg><seg type="columnLine">in scientific details; a good many leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">science factor absolutely flat and not a few of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them make the reader wonder why they are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">called science stories. Noticeably absent in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">majority of the stories is the element of</seg><seg type="columnLine">romance. Of course, essentially speaking, ro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mance is not usually associated with science,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but we must not forget that these stories are</seg><seg type="columnLine">also fiction and a romantic vein always height-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ens the interest of the reader. After all we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">still human and as such we are always suscept-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible to the pathos of that age-old figure, Cupid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another noticeable fact that might bear men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioning is the length of the stories, most of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">being too short. This type of story is usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">crammed full of scientific explanations with very</seg><seg type="columnLine">little action and space. The reader does not</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a chance to absorb all the details before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story is finished. Certainly he feels as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were precipitated into a cyclone, turned end</seg><seg type="columnLine">over end, bounced a couple of times, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">dumped on the ground and left uncomprehend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, like a man just coming out of a nightmare.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd much rather have one or two novel-length</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories than a flock of shorts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, I'd better terminate this letter be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore I utter too much, for no author or artist</seg><seg type="columnLine">can please everybody.

Then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">again, out in space a man's muscles are free</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from earth's drag and I am convinced from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">careful thought that out there, if we ever get</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there, we shall find our mental and physical</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">powers tremendously increased through this very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">freedom from earth-drag. Now add another</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">factor. It is well known that under conditions</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of desperation a man can exert man}' times his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">normal power for a short time. Here was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man in a position of the utmost deperation, a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man with a world to save, a man with the girl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of his heart in the most hideous danger. Figure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that part out for yourself, Mr. Latham, and see</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">how much effort he could put forth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I may add that before using this incident,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which I expected to be questioned, I covered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a good many sheets of foolscap with mathe-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">matics until I was finally convinced that it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">just possible, though I may have slipped up in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the length of the rod. The rod, of course,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">might be of much greater length than sixteen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feet, for it would be easy to handle out in space</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through its weightlessness (not its massless-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ness) and would no doubt be made of some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">metal alloy far more highly resistant than any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yet produced on earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The other point about the shrinkage of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vehicles, etc., is also well taken, but Mr. Latham</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">has, I'm afraid not read very carefully here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The reduction to 1/35 in size was in volume,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not in length, which is very different and also</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it must be quite obvious that the earth's dia-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">meter shrank as the earth itself shrank, other-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wise there would have been no shrinkage of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">land areas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I am fully prepared to admit that this shrink-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">age would cause almost incredible inconve-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nience, and before writing the story I made a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">list of these difficulties which numbered nearly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a hundred items. In the end, however, I de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cided that it was not necessary to drag in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">explanation of them for these reasons:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The changes took place slowly over a great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">number of years. Therefore an advanced civil-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ization would be able to meet them and adapt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their lives to them so that, despite inconvenience</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and suffering, life would still be endurable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  To include explanation of these difficul-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ties would increase the length of the story be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yond reasonable limits without adding a thing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the interest. To put it the other way, it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would kill interest through tediousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then one assumes that the reader of science-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fiction has his own imagination and, as Mr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Latham himself has obviously done, they like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to use that imagination on such problems.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The "drag on the intellect" through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shrinkage not affecting organic bodies does not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seem to me to be any greater than that due</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to trying to visualize the actual shrinkage itself,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yet that shrinkage was actually prophesized by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one of our greatest physicists. It is, of course,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">obvious that something like that must have oc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">curred. Otherwise no one would have been in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">any way conscious of the shrinkage. In fact</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">such phenomena may be in progress right now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for all we can tell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Perhaps, after reading these explanations Mr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Latham will conclude that my science is neither</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so "execrable" nor so "unpardonable" as he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">appears to think. The strength of his expres-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sions rather tempts me to retort by asking him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to remember the proverb about the dangers of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"a little knowledge."

I believe I shall be pardoned for</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking up a little of your time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I like science fiction stories very much. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquired the seeds of this affliction as a ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">year-old boy (some thirty-five years ago)</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I spent many a happy hour with my old</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend, Jules Verne, or rather, with one of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">books. I may be hard to please, or as the years</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll by, may have grown more critical--but, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot think of a single science fiction story</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would have since given me as much pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure as the works of that great writer. Ah,</seg><seg type="columnLine">them were the happy days of expectant youth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing the mysteries of life and avidly reading</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories that gave the imagination free rein.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I presume that this early experience left in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my make-up a preference for stories that make</seg><seg type="columnLine">me think and use my imagination in following</seg><seg type="columnLine">the writer and attempting to go even beyond.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore, I must confess I did not like "Chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren of the Great Magma'' in your August-</seg><seg type="columnLine">September issue. I haven't found anything in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that story which would in an interesting way</seg><seg type="columnLine">tie up present scientific knowledge with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">logical future development. However, the story</seg><seg type="columnLine">is well written and interesting as a story per</seg><seg type="columnLine">se, but, to my mind, not what I should class</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a science fiction story. In another magazine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should read it and enjoy it much more. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">science fiction magazine, it seems just a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now that I have started in finding fault, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might as well keep it up until I get it all off</seg><seg type="columnLine">my chest. I am always disappointed when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">science fiction author makes a statement which</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little ordinary care in refreshing his memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">by reference to a text book would prove to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong. I refer to the story "The Essence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Life" in the same issue. Our friend, the author</seg><seg type="columnLine">from across the pond, says that when Mendel</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed tall peas with dwarf peas, some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">offspring were tall, others dwarf and still others</seg><seg type="columnLine">intermediate. I believe that he is mistaken and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could have avoided this mistake had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked up on this. In his experiments Gregor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johann Mendel found that tallness was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominant character in the pea plants, in other</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, that when you cross a tall pea plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a short one, the offspring will be tall, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that short or dwarf plants will be produced only</seg><seg type="columnLine">140</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">April, 1934</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">by crossing short plants with short plants. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same paragraph he says that this offspring</seg><seg type="columnLine">bred "true." Such a text book as I refer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">will also confirm that the offspring cannot be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">"true" or "pure" type; it is a hybrid, for al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the recessive character (in this case</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortness) is hidden or masked and dominated</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely by the dominant character, i.e., the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tallness, the plant protoplasm contains one</seg><seg type="columnLine">unit character from each of the two parent</seg><seg type="columnLine">plants. Under certain conditions of crossing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">recessive character will again crop up. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, that would take up too much space and</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be looked up in a text book.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The story I like best in this issue is "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Silicon Empire." It gives me something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think about. It is not one of the exciting kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stories with dramatic situations and climaxes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but is a well written science fiction story. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">common with quite a few other science fiction</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories, it falls down in one particular. In speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of life developing from inorganic silicon</seg><seg type="columnLine">compounds, the author says that the conditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">under which the few silicon compounds are</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed that we know of, are different from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions under which the corresponding car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bon compounds form. Right there a paragraph</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrasting the two sets of conditions and enu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merating them would furnish a little food for</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought to those of us who like to find a</seg><seg type="columnLine">point to tie up the known with the speculative.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, I like this story best.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two short stories, i.e., "Across the Ages"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and "The Pellucid Horror" arc both well writ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten and easy to read. I do not know which one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the two I should put first with respect</seg><seg type="columnLine">to masterly construction, descriptive language</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all-around writing technique. From a stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of science fiction I prefer "The Pellucid</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horror," as there seems to be no scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">statement of any kind, nor a deduction drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">or speculation based on a known scientific fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">in "Across the Ages." All the latter story does</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that respect is to set one thinking about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vagaries of the human mind under the stress</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some strong emotion, coupled with lowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical and mental resistance due to extremely</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot weather. In "The Pellucid Horror" why</seg><seg type="columnLine">did the reporter and the scientist see the doctor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes, whereas the persons attacked by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">physician had not seen them?--Undoubtedly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">maniac doctor must have gone out on his trips</seg><seg type="columnLine">sans clothes, but why should he put them on</seg><seg type="columnLine">at home knowing that this would give him</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to anyone that might happen to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectacle of the animated clothes?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I shall have to quit, for, in this part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, it has been hot as blazes for over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">month, and the fact that I, who am neither a</seg><seg type="columnLine">writer, nor a scientist, have undertaken to</seg><seg type="columnLine">criticise the writings of science fiction writers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes me wonder whether I, myself, am not</seg><seg type="columnLine">acting under the influence of some approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">brainstorm due to the heat.

Mr. Nixon speaks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an "error" in the story, as if the writing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it had been a hasty slapping down of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill-considered plot; a plot so sketchy or absurd</seg><seg type="columnLine">that even its author could not remember it</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one page to another!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The truth is quite the contrary. The plot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this story was carefully developed as a perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">defensible method of time-travel. In the Dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussions one often sees such phrases as "Cut out</seg><seg type="columnLine">time-travel stories, everyone knows they're im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible." Now, "in the bright lexicon" of sci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence fiction, the word "impossible" is anathema,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I thought it would be a good idea to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">front these cocksure correspondents with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">story of time-travel, which, though far-fetched</seg><seg type="columnLine">(as they all must be), could resist at all points</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most diligent attempts to prove a flaw or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">contradiction of any bnoivn scientific law.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I started with the undeniable, experimentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">established fact that time moves at different</seg><seg type="columnLine">rates in different places.

We</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose further that, when the explosion or</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakdown does occur, the "timeless space" ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pears at two different times in the outside world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The "timeless space" is by definition, indepen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent of time in the outside world, you see, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this view is perfectly natural.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now put a hero into the machine, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the breakdown occurs, you have two of him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one in the present, say, and one in the future.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is my impression that Mr. Nixon thinks that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the priority of the "future form" of the hero,</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained in the last paragraph, is a careless</seg><seg type="columnLine">error upon my part. Strangely enough, he does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not voice the obvious but answerable objection,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that an event in the future, cannot, in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">subtle sense, also be in the past. Instead, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to think that this priority of the "future</seg><seg type="columnLine">form" will (in some way known only to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self), interfere with the operation of the "gravi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tational potential" machine, a notion that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly preposterous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Incidentally, that silly-sounding "pill-ball" in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Nixonian communication is really PITH-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball, meaning a spherical mass of a very light</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant-substance called pith.
