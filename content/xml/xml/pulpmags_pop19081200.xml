                    <ab>Davis Man" he has reason for it; not a mere fancy. Business men do not deal with "fancies." They know the "why" and the "wherefore" in every case they decide. They know from
                        experience and observation that Page-Davis men are qualified.</ab>
                    <ab>They know where to apply for ca- pable advertising talent, therefore they waste no time experimenting.</ab>
                    <ab>So long as the Page-Davis School is the most substantial school of its kind in the world--so long as the Page-Davis School teaches advertising as it should be taught--?o long
                        as men who graduate from the Page-Davis School produce ad- vertising matter that increases their business they say: "Yes Sir; we want a Page-Davis Man."</ab>
                    <ab>The business man who employs a Page-Davis man finds him quick, efficient, better informed than any one hr has employed before, and when the time comes that he is in need of
                        another advertising man he is sure to say: "1 want a Page-Davis Man."</ab>
                    <ab>A large advertising agency in Philadelphia calls regu- larly for a "Page-Davis Man." e are indebted to ycu for furnishing us a good man before," they write. A branch office of
                        one of the largest electrical concerns in the world found its first Page-Davis man so thoroughly trained that he was sent to the main office in New York, and made Adver- tising
                        Manager-in-chief. That the advertising man who tcck his place at the branch office was a Page-Davis man and that every other advertising man they subsequently emp!o}ed w as a
                        Page-Davis man need hardly be slated. \X e can cite a book full of such instances. We w ant to show in how w idely diversified fields the Page-Davis trained man is pre- pared
                        to w-crk. We want to show that there are opportu- nities for Page-Davis men in every line of endeavcr where salaries of $25.00 to $100.00 is paid--that it is not only the
                        retailer--not only the manufacturer w ho employs the P. ge- Davis man but the professor, the publisher and the adver- tising agent as well.</ab>
