Although, in my </p><p>opinion, Amazing Stories is one of the most interest- </p><p>ing fiction magazines published, some of the stories have </p><p>such obvious scientific mistakes in them, that they seem </p><p>more like fairy tales than scientifiction, and conse- </p><p>quently appear to be out of place in your magazine. </p><p> For example, even admitting the possibility of a</p><p> “fourth dimension’’ as set forth in Murray Leinster’s</p><p> "The Runaway Skyscraper," a little reasoning would</p><p> prove that any timepiece contained in the building at</p><p> the time of slipping into the fourth dimension would</p><p> not run backwards, but instead would continue for-</p><p> ward, as did all other machinery; also, several other</p><p> authors, in transporting their characters from one planet</p><p> to another, have never considered the difference of</p><p> bacterial life upon these worlds, which would speedily</p><p> cause the death of any visitors who arrived on a new</p><p> planet without first having acquired immunity from the</p><p> ravages of its organisms.</p><p> As an example of an excusable error, I might cite the</p><p> one in "High Tension,” by Albert B. Stuart, where the</p><p> ligaments were able to stand up under the great strain</p><p> exerted upon them by the highly stimulated muscles.</p><p> As a closing suggestion, I think that the magazine</p><p> would be greatly improved if scientific anecdotes or</p><p> paragraphs containing information which would in-</p><p> crease the plausibility of stories in past or present issues,</p><p> were set between the various stories.</p><p>Sincerely yours, </p><p> (Signed) W. F. CRIST,</p><p> 3448 Clay Street,</p><p> San Fransico, Calif.</p><p> It is a pleasure to receive letters of this kind, because they</p><p>indicate that our readers are intensely interested in the type </p><p>of fiction which wc publish, and also that the stories are </p><p>given serious consideration. This is a wholesome sign, and </p><p>we can only say that such correspondence is most welcome. </p><p>When the magazine is enlarged, which will be very soon, </p><p>there will be a special department wherein letters of this </p><p>nature will be printed and discussed. </p><p> Regarding the statement contained in the above letter,</p><p>permit us to say that a writer of scientifiction is privileged </p><p>to use poetic license, the same as is the writer of any other, </p><p>fiction story. There is rarely a story of this type so perfect </p><p>as to pass muster with all of its facts, the general theme, </p><p>and many other points. </p><p> For example, even in the best-written fiction stories you</p><p>will notice the characters converse in rather extraordinary </p><p>language. This is the so-callcd fiction language and is </p><p>not generally used in real life. Open almost any first-class </p><p>magazine and, if you stop to think for a second, you will </p><p>realize that human beings do not use the flowery language </p><p>that the characters do in fiction. The same is true of scien- </p><p>tjfiction in another respect, where authors often take poetic </p><p>license, sometimes disregarding true scientific facts, although </p><p>still retaining enough scientific accuracy to make the plot </p><p>or story seem probable and at the same time interesting. </p><p> Referring to Murray Leinster’s "The Runaway Sky-</p><p>scraper” our correspondent is probably correct as to the </p><p>timepieces. But why pick on the timepieces? If we grant </p><p>the fourth dimension, we will have to grant the rest of the </p><p>—to us—queer things supposed to exist on this higher plane, </p><p>and if we do not grant any, then wc had better not read the </p><p>story at all. Because of the assumption that a century </p><p>of time can run backwards, the author naturally must make </p><p>everything run backwards. </p><p> As to the criticism of bacterial life on other worlds, we</p><p>believe it was H. G. Wells, who first pointed out this danger </p><p>in transporting living creatures from one world or planet to </p><p>another, but at best this only is a theory. There is nothing </p><p>known about bacterial life in other worlds, but it is certain </p><p>that if explorers ever will travel from one planet to another, </p><p>this will be taken into consideration, and they will be in- </p><p>noculatcd, just as travelers now arc innoculatcd when travel-</p><p>ing from northern to tropical zones, and vice versa. </p><p> But why stop at the bacterial danger? There may be far</p><p>more deadly things experienced in travelling from one planet </p><p>to another than we know of today. Professor Millikan’s </p><p>researches recently showed, for example, that his Cosmic </p><p>Ray, wljich seems to abound in extra-terrestrial space, is far </p><p>more deadly than anything we know of. He has found that </p><p>the Cosmic Ray can pierce solid lead six feet in thickness, </p><p>whereas the ordinary X-ray, which is itself deadly enough, </p><p>is stopped by a thin sheet of lead. The harm which these </p><p>rays might do to an interplanetarian traveler, we arc loath </p><p>to think of. What they might be, for instance, on the moon, </p><p>makes one shudder, because the moon having no atmosphere, </p><p>any poor human being would probably be killed immediately </p><p>if he had not some sort of protection, which today has as </p><p>yet not been invented or even thought of. </p><p> We disagree with our correspondent as to the strength of</p><p> the ligaments in "High Tension.” Wc believe the story</p><p> of the highly-stimulated muscles to be scientifically correct.</p><p> A medical authority vouches for the general accuracy of the</p><p> statements of the.story.</p><p> n '*‘,rDI.....Kuo.imm ntu.M r..xMiWi:iimnuun&gt;iniraii^iiia/uwiuiwk/iiBuu!nunuiKauhxxmi/HiuiuiUuiinimuimiimniiau;uiukramnnnui!iinniniiuiiiiinirTmnmfTniTniiniininrniiiimimitaiifniirnnirrnriiiniiiiirnaniiniitmiiuiuiniriiuiiiiiiiniiiiciiiiHii»iitiiiiiii»iiiiiia</p><p> Mr. Hugo Gemsback speaks every Monday at 9 P.

SERVISS</p><p>CHAPTER I </p><p>Cosmo Versal </p><p>N undersized, lean, wizen-faced) man, </p><p>with an immense bald head, as round </p><p>and smooth and shining as a giant soap- </p><p>bubble, and a pair of beady black eyes, </p><p>set close together, so that he resembled </p><p>a gnome of amazing brain capacity and prodigious </p><p>power of concentration, sat bent over a writing </p><p>desk with a huge sheet of cardboard before him, </p><p>on which he was swiftly drawing geometrical </p><p>and trigonometrical figures. Compasses, T-squares, </p><p>rulers, protractors, and ellipsographs obeyed the </p><p>touch of his fingers as if inspired with life. </p><p> The room around him was a jungle of terrestrial</p><p>and celestial globes, chemists’ retorts, tubes, pipes, </p><p>and all the indescribable apparatus that modern </p><p>science has invented, and which, to the uninitiated, </p><p>seems as incomprehensible as the ancient para- </p><p>phernalia of alchemists and astrologers. The walls </p><p>were lined with book shelves, and adorned along </p><p>the upper portions with the most extraordinary </p><p>photographs and drawings. Even the ceiling was </p><p>covered with charts, some representing the sky, </p><p>while many others were </p><p>geological and topogra- </p><p>phical pictures of the face </p><p>of the earth. </p><p> Beside the drawing-</p><p>board lay a pad of paper, </p><p>and occasionally the little </p><p>man nervously turned to</p><p>this, and, grasping a long </p><p>pencil, made elaborate cal- </p><p>culations, covering the </p><p>paper with a sprinkling </p><p>of mathematical symbols </p><p>that looked like magnified </p><p>animalcules. While he </p><p>worked, under a high light </p><p>from a single window placed well up near the ceil- </p><p>ing, his forehead contracted into a hundred wrink- </p><p>les, his cheeks became feverous, his piercing eyes </p><p>glowed with inner fire, and drops of perspiration </p><p>ran down in front of his ears. One would have </p><p>thought that he was laboring to save his very soul </p><p>and had but a few seconds of respite left. </p><p> Presently he threw down the pencil, and with</p><p>astonishing agility let himself rapidly, but care- </p><p>fully, off the stool on which he had been sitting, </p><p>keeping the palms of his hands on the seat beside </p><p>his hips until he felt his feet touch the floor. Then </p><p>he darted at a book-shelf, pulled down a ponderous </p><p>tome, flapped it open in a clear space on the floor, </p><p>and dropped on his knees to consult it. </p><p> After turning a leaf or two he found what he</p><p>was after, read down the page, keeping a finger on </p><p>the lines, and, having finished his reading, jumped </p><p>to his feet and hurried back to the stool, on which </p><p>he mounted so quickly that it was impossible to </p><p>see how he managed it without an upset. Instantly </p><p>he made a new diagram, and then fell to figuring </p><p>furiously on the pad, making his pencil gyrate so </p><p>fast that its upper end vibrated like the wing of </p><p>a dragon-fly. </p><p> At last he threw down the pencil, and, encircling</p><p>his knees with his clasped arms, sank in a heap </p><p>on the stool. The lids dropped over his shining </p><p>eyes, and he became buried in thought. </p><p> When he reopened his eyes and unbent his brows,</p><p>his gaze happened to be directed toward the row </p><p>of curious big photographs which ran like a pic- </p><p>tured frieze round the upper side of the wall of the </p><p>room. A casual observer might have thought that </p><p>the little man had been amusing himself by photo- </p><p>graphing the explosions of fireworks on a Fourth </p><p>of July night; but it was evident by his expression </p><p>that these singular pic- </p><p>tures had no connection </p><p>with civic pyrotechnics, </p><p>but must represent some- </p><p>thing of a most pro- </p><p>nounced fatal and stu- </p><p>pendous import.</p><p> The little man’s face</p><p>took on a rapt look, in </p><p>which wonder and fear </p><p>seemed to be blended. </p><p>With a sweep of his hand </p><p>he included the whole ser- </p><p>ies of photographs in a </p><p>comprehensive glance, and </p><p>then, setting his gaze up- </p><p>on a particularly bizarre object in the center, he be- </p><p>gan to speak aloud, although there was nobody to </p><p>listen to him. </p><p> “My God’” he said. “That’s it! That Lick</p><p>photograph of the Lord Rosse nebula is its very </p><p>image, except that there’s no electric fire in it. </p><p>The same great whirl of outer spirals, and then </p><p>comes the awful central mass—and we’re going to </p><p>plunge straight into it. Then quintrillions of tons </p><p>of water will condense on the earth and cover it </p><p>like a universal cloudburst. And then good-by to </p><p>the human race—unless—unless—I, Cosmo Versfcl, </p><p> pROFESSSOR GARRETT P. SERVISS needs no in-</p><p> *■ troduciion to you after you have read “A Columbus</p><p> of Space/’ but here the well-known scientist-author has</p><p> hit upon the effects created upon modern humanity by a</p><p> second deluge. It is an impressive tale, and not a</p><p> whit more improbable than the first Noachian deluge of</p><p> Biblical days. Only the setting is modern, and the second</p><p> great ark is, of course, vastly different from that used</p><p> by Noah. Then, of course, there are a great many other</p><p> things in "The Second Deluge" that Noah never even</p><p> dreamt of, and that surely never happened to him. What</p><p> these things are you will find out by reading this entranc-</p><p> ing classic.</p><p>678 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>inspired by science, can save a remnant to repeople </p><p>the planet after the catastrophe.” </p><p> Again, for a moment, he closed his eyes, and</p><p>puckered his hemispherical brow, while, with drawn- </p><p>up knees, he seemed perilously balanced on the high </p><p>stool. Several times he slowly shook his head, and </p><p>when his eyes reopened their fire was gone, and a </p><p>reflective film covered them. He began to speak, </p><p>more deliberately than before, and in a musing </p><p>tone: </p><p> “What can I do? I don’t believe there is a moun-</p><p>tain on the face of the globe lofty enough to lift </p><p>its head above that flood. Hum, hum! It’s no use </p><p>thinking about mountains! The flood will be six </p><p>miles deep—six miles from the present sea-level; </p><p>my last calculation proves it beyond all question. </p><p>And that’s only a minimum—it may be miles deeper, </p><p>for no mortal man can tell exactly what’ll happen </p><p>when the earth plunges into a nebula like that. </p><p> “We’ll have to float; that’s the thing. I’ll have</p><p>to build an ark. I’ll be a second Noah. I’ll ad- </p><p>vise the whole world to build arks. </p><p> “Millions might save themselves that way, for</p><p>the flood is not going to last forever. We’ll get </p><p>through the nebula in a few months, and then </p><p>the waters will gradually recede, and the high </p><p>lands will emerge again. But it’ll be an awful long </p><p>time; I doubt if the earth will ever be just as it </p><p>was before. There won’t be much room, except for </p><p>fish—but there won’t be many inhabitants for what </p><p>dry land there is.” </p><p> Once more he fell into silent meditation, and</p><p>while he mused there came a knock at the door. </p><p>The little man started up on his seat, alert as a </p><p>squirrel, and turned his eyes over his shoulder, </p><p>listening intently. The knock was repeated—three </p><p>quick sharp raps. Evidently he at once recognized </p><p>them. </p><p> “All right,” he called out, and, letting himself</p><p>down, ran swiftly to the door and opened it. </p><p> A tall, thin man, with bushy black hair, heavy</p><p>eyebrows, a high, narrow forehead, and a wide, </p><p>clean shaven mouth, wearing a solemn kind of </p><p>smile, entered and grasped the little man by both </p><p>hands. </p><p> “Cosmo,” he said, without wasting any time on</p><p>preliminaries, “have you worked it out?”</p><p> “I have just finished.”</p><p> “And you find the worst?”</p><p> “Yes, worse than I ever dreamed it would be. The</p><p>waters will be six miles deep.” </p><p> “Phew!” exclaimed the other, his smile fading.</p><p>“That is indeed serious. And when does it begin ?” </p><p>“Inside of a year. We’re within three hundred </p><p>million miles of the watery nebula now, and you </p><p>know that the earth travels more than that distance! </p><p>in twelve months.” </p><p> “Have you seen it?”</p><p> “How could I see it—haven’t I told you it i3 in-</p><p>visible? If it could be seen all these stupid astrono- </p><p>mers would have spotted it long ago. But I’ll tell </p><p>you what I have seen.” </p><p> Cosmo Versal’s voice sank into a whisper, and</p><p>he shuddered slightly as he went on: </p><p> “Only last night I was sweeping the sky with the</p><p>telescope when I noticed, in Hercules and Lyra, and </p><p>all that part of the heavens, a dimming .of some </p><p>of the fainter stars. It was like the shadow of the </p><p>shroud of a ghost. Nobody else would have noticed </p><p>it, and I wouldn’t if I had not been looking for it. </p><p>It’s knowledge that clarifies the eyes and breeds </p><p>knowledge, Joseph Smith. It was not truly visible, </p><p>and yet I could see that it was there. I tried to </p><p>make out the shape of the thing—but it was too </p><p>indefinite. But I know very well what it is. See </p><p>here”—he suddenly broke off—“Look at the photo- </p><p>graph.” (He was pointing at the Lord Rosse </p><p>nebula on the wall). “It’s like that, only it’s com- </p><p>ing edgewise toward us. We may miss some of the </p><p>outer spirals, but we’re going to smash into the </p><p>center.” </p><p> With fallen jaw, and black brows contracted,</p><p>Joseph Smith stared at the photograph. </p><p> “It doesn’t shine like that,” he said at last.</p><p> The little man snorted contemptuously.</p><p> “What have I told you about its invisibility?”</p><p>he demanded. </p><p> “But how, then, do you know that it is of a watery</p><p>nature?” </p><p> Cosmo Vers&amp;l threw up his hands and waved</p><p>them in an agony of impatience. He climbed upon</p><p>his stool to get nearer the level of the other’s eyes, </p><p>and fixing him with his gaze, exclaimed: </p><p> “You know very well how I know it. I know</p><p>it because I have demonstrated with my new spec- </p><p>troscope, which analyses extra-visual rays, that all </p><p>those dark nebulae that were photographed in the </p><p>milky way years ago are composed of watery vapor. </p><p>They are far off, on the limits of the universe. This </p><p>one is one right at hand. It’s a little one compared </p><p>with them—but it’s enough, yes, it’s enough! You </p><p>know that more than two years ago I began to cor- </p><p>respond with astronomers all over the world about </p><p>this thing, and not one of them would listen to me. </p><p>Well, they’ll listen when it’s too late perhaps. </p><p> “They'll listen when the flood-gates are opened</p><p>and the inundation begins. It’s not the first time </p><p>that this thing has happened. I haven't a doubt </p><p>that the flood of Noah, that everybody pretends to </p><p>laugh at now, was caused by the earth passing </p><p>through a watery nebula. But this will be worse </p><p>than that; there weren’t two thousand million peo- </p><p>ple to be drowned then as there are now.” </p><p> For five minutes neither spoke. Cosmo Versal</p><p>swung on the stool, and played with an ellipsograph; </p><p>Joseph Smith dropped his chin on his breast and </p><p>nervously fingered the pockets of his long vest. At </p><p>last he raised his head and asked, in a low voice: </p><p>“What are'you going to do, Cosmo?” </p><p> “I’m going to get ready,” was the short reply,</p><p> “How?”</p><p> “Build an ark.”</p><p> “But will you give no warning to others?”</p><p> “I’ll do my best. I’ll telephone to all the officials,</p><p>scientific and otherwise, in America, Europe, Africa, </p><p>Asia, and Australia. I’ll write in every language </p><p>to all the newspapers and magazines. I’ll send out </p><p>circulars. I’ll counsel everybody to drop every other </p><p>occupation and begin to build arks—but nobody will </p><p>heed me. You’ll see. My ark will be the only one, </p><p>but I’ll save as many in it as I can. And I depend </p><p>upon you, Joseph, to help me. From all appear- </p><p>ances, it’s the only chance that the human race has </p><p>of survival. </p><p>THE SECOND DELUGE </p><p>679 </p><p> "If I hadn’t made this discovery they would all</p><p>have been wiped out like miners in a flooded pit. </p><p>We may persuade a few to be saved—but what an </p><p>awful thing it is that, when the truth is thrust </p><p>into their very faces, people won’t believe, won’t </p><p>listen, won’t see, won’t be helped, but will die like </p><p>dogs in their obstinate ignorance and blindness.” </p><p>“But they will, they must, listen to you,” said </p><p>Joseph Smith eagerly. </p><p> "They won’t, but I must make them,” replied</p><p>Cosmo Versal. “Anyhow, I must make a few of </p><p>the best of them hear me. The fate of a whole race </p><p>is at stake. If we can save a handful of the best </p><p>blood and brain of mankind, the world will have </p><p>a new chance, and perhaps a better and higher race </p><p>will be the result. Since I can’t save them all, </p><p>I'll pick and choose. I’ll have the flower of human- </p><p>ity in my ark. I’ll at least snatch that much from </p><p>the jaws of destruction.” </p><p> The little man was growing very earnest and his</p><p>eyes were aglow with the fire of enthusiastic pur- </p><p>pose. As he dropped his head on one side, it looked </p><p>too heavy for the stemlike neck, but it conveyed an </p><p>impression of immense intellectual power. Its </p><p>imposing contour lent force to his words. </p><p> “The flower of humanity,” he continued after a</p><p>slight pause. “Who composes it? I must decide </p><p>that question. Is it the billionaires? Is it the </p><p>kings and rulers? Is it the men of science? Is it </p><p>the society leaders? Bah! I’ll have to think on </p><p>that. I can’t take them all, but I’ll give them all </p><p>a chance to save themselves though I know they </p><p>won't act on the advice.” </p><p> Here he paused.</p><p> “Won’t the existing ships do—especially if</p><p>more are built?” Joseph Smith suddenly asked, in- </p><p>terrupting Cosmo’s train of thought. </p><p> “Not at all,” was the reply. “They’re not suited</p><p>to the kind of navigation that will be demanded. </p><p>They’re not buoyant enough, nor manageable </p><p>enough, and they haven't enough carrying capacity </p><p>for power and provisions. They’ll be swamped at </p><p>the wharves, or if they should get away they’d be </p><p>sent to the bottom inside a few hours. Nothing </p><p>but specially constructed arks will serve. And </p><p>there’s more trouble for me—I must devise a new </p><p>form of vessel. Heavens, how short the time is! </p><p>Why couldn’t I have found this out ten years ago? </p><p>It's only to-day that I have myself learned the full</p><p>truth, though I have worked on it so long.” </p><p> “How many will you be able to carry in your</p><p>ark?” asked Smith. </p><p> “I can’t tell yet. That’s another question to be</p><p>carefully considered. I shall build the vessel of this </p><p>new metal, levium, half as heavy as aluminum and </p><p>twice as strong as steel. I ought to find room with- </p><p>out the slightest difficulty for a round thousand in </p><p>it.” </p><p> “Surely many more than that!” exclaimed Joseph</p><p>Smith. “Why, there are ocean-liners that carry </p><p>several times as many.” </p><p> “You forget,” replied Cosmo Versal, “that we</p><p>must have provisions enough to last for a long </p><p>time, because we cannot count on the immediate </p><p>reemergence of any land, even the most mountain- </p><p>ous, and the most compressed food takes space when </p><p>a great quantity is needed. It won’t do to over- </p><p>crowd the vessel, and invite sickness. Then too, </p><p>I must take many animals along.” </p><p> “Animals,” returned Smith. “I hadn’t thought of</p><p>that. But is it necessary?” </p><p> “Absolutely. Would you have less foresight than</p><p>Noah? I shall not imitate him by taking male and </p><p>female of every species, but I must at least provide </p><p>for restocking such land as eventually appears above </p><p>the waters with the animals most useful to man. </p><p>Then, too, animals are essential to the life of the </p><p>earth. Any agricultural chemist would tell you </p><p>that. They play an indispensable part in the vital </p><p>cycle of the soil. I must also take certain species </p><p>of insects and birds. I’ll telephone Professor Herge- </p><p>schmitberger at Berlin to learn precisely what are </p><p>the capitally important species of the animal king- </p><p>dom.” </p><p> “And when will you begin the construction of the</p><p>ark?” </p><p> “Instantly. There’s not a moment to lose. And</p><p>it's equally important to send out warnings broad- </p><p>cast immediately. There you can help me. You </p><p>know what I want to say. Write it out at once; </p><p>put it as strong as you can; send it every where; </p><p>put it in the shape of posters; hurry it to the news- </p><p>paper offices. Telephone, in my name, to the Car- </p><p>negie Institution, to the Smithsonian Institution, </p><p>to the Royal Society, to the French, Russian, </p><p>Italian, German, and all the other Academies and </p><p>Associations of Science to be found anywhere on </p><p>earth.</p><p> “Don’t neglect the slightest means of publicity.</p><p>Thank Heaven, the money to pay for all this is not </p><p>lacking. If my good father, when he piled up his </p><p>fortune from the profits of the original Trans- </p><p>continental Aerian Company, could have foreseen </p><p>the use to which his son would put it for the bene- </p><p>fit—what do I say, for the benefit? nay, for the </p><p>salvation—of mankind, he would have rejoiced in </p><p>his work.” </p><p> “Ah, that reminds me,” exclaimed Joseph Smith.</p><p>“I was about to ask, a few minutes ago, why air- </p><p>ships would not do for this business. Couldn’t peo- </p><p>ple save themselves from the flood by taking refuge </p><p>in the atmosphere?” </p><p> Cosmo Versal looked at his questioner with an</p><p>ironical smile. </p><p> “Do you know,” he asked, "how long a dirigible</p><p>can be kept afloat? Do you know for how long a </p><p>voyage the best airplane types can be provisioned </p><p>with power? There’s not an airship of any kind </p><p>that can go more than two weeks at the very utter- </p><p>most without touching solid earth, and then it must </p><p>be mighty sparing of its power. If we can save </p><p>mankind now, and give it another chance, perhaps </p><p>the time will come when power can be drawn out of </p><p>the ether of space, and men can float in the air as </p><p>long as they choose. </p><p> “But as things are now, we must go back to</p><p>Noah’s plan, and trust tc the buoyant power of </p><p>water. I fully expect that when the deluge begins </p><p>people will flock to the highlands and the mountains </p><p>in airships—but alas! that won’t save them. Re- </p><p>member what I have told you—this flood is going </p><p>to be six miles deep!” </p><p> The second morning after the conversation be-</p><p>tween Cosmo Versal and Joseph Smith, New York </p><p>680 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>was startled by seeing, in huge red letters, on every </p><p>blank wall, on the bare flanks of towering sky- </p><p>scrapers, on the lofty stations of airplane lines, on </p><p>billboards, fences, advertising-boards along subur- </p><p>ban roads, in the Subway stations, and fluttering </p><p>from strings of kites over the city, the following </p><p>announcement: </p><p>THE WORLD IS TO BE DROWNED! </p><p>Save Yourselves While It Is Yet Time! </p><p>Drop Your Business: It Is of No Consequence! </p><p>Build Arks: It Is Your Only Salvation! </p><p>The Earth Is Going To Plunge into a Watery </p><p>Nebula: There Is No Escape! </p><p>Hundreds of Millions Will Be Drowned: You Have </p><p>Only a Few Months To Get Ready! </p><p>For Particulars Address: Cosmo Versal, </p><p>3000 Fifth Avenue </p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>Mocking at Fate </p><p>WHEN New York recovered from its first </p><p>astonishment over the extraordinary post- </p><p>ers, it indulged in a loud laugh. Every- </p><p>body knew who Cosmo Vers&amp;l was. His eccentrici- </p><p>ties had filled many readable columns in the news- </p><p>papers. Yet there was a certain respect for him, </p><p>too. This was due to his extraordinary intellectual </p><p>ability and unquestionable scientific knowledge. </p><p>But his imagination was as free as the winds, and </p><p>it often led him upon excursions in which nobody </p><p>could follow him, and which caused the more steady- </p><p>going scientific brethren to shake their heads. They </p><p>called him able but flighty. The public at times </p><p>called him brilliant and amusing. </p><p> His father, who had sprung from some unknown</p><p>source in southeastern Europe, and, beginning as a </p><p>newsboy in New York, had made , his way to the </p><p>front in the financial world, had left his entire </p><p>fortune to Cosmo. The latter had no taste for </p><p>finance or business, but a devouring appetite for </p><p>science, to which, in his own way, he devoted all </p><p>his powers; all his time, and all his money. He </p><p>never married, was never seen in society, and had </p><p>very few intimates—but he was known by sight,</p><p>or reputation, to everybody. There was not a </p><p>scientific body or association of any consequence </p><p>in the world of which he was not a member. Those </p><p>which looked askance at his bizarre ideas were glad </p><p>to accept pecuniary aid from him. </p><p> The notion that the world was to be drowned</p><p>had taken possession of him about three years be- </p><p>fore the opening scene of this narrative. To work </p><p>out the idea, he built an observatory, set up a labora- </p><p>tory, invented instruments, including his strange </p><p>spectroscope (which was scoffed at by the scientific </p><p>world). </p><p> Finally, submitting the results of his observations</p><p>to mathematical treatment, he proved, to his own </p><p>satisfaction, the absolute correctness of his thesis </p><p>that the well-known “proper motion of the solar </p><p>system” was about to result in an encounter be- </p><p>tween the earth and an invisible watery nebula, </p><p>which would have the effect of inundating the globe. </p><p>As this startling idea gradually took shape, he com- </p><p>municated. it to scientific men in all lands, but failed </p><p>to find a single disciple, except his friend Joseph </p><p>Smith, who, without being able to follow all his </p><p>reasonings, accepted on trust the conclusions of </p><p>Cosmo’s more powerful mind. Accordingly, at the </p><p>end of his investigation, he enlisted Smith as secre- </p><p>tary, propagandist, and publicity agent. </p><p> New York laughed a whole day and night at</p><p>the warning red letters. They were the talk of the </p><p>town. People joked about them in cafes, clubs, at </p><p>home, in the streets, in the offices, in the exchanges, </p><p>in the street-cars, on the Elevated, in the Subways. </p><p>Crowds gathered on corners to watch the flapping </p><p>posters aloft on the kite lines. The afternoon news- </p><p>papers issued specials which were all about the </p><p>coming flood, and everywhere one heard the cry </p><p>of the newsboys: “Extra-a-a! Drowning of a </p><p>Thousand Million People! Cosmo Versal predicts </p><p>the End of the World!” On their editorial pages </p><p>the papers were careful to discount the scare lines, </p><p>and terriflc pictures, that covered the front sheets, </p><p>with humorous jibes at the author of the formid- </p><p>able prediction. </p><p> The Owl, which was the only paper that put the</p><p>news in half a column of ordinary type, took a </p><p>judicial attitude, called upon the city authorities to </p><p>tear down the posters, and hinted that “this absurd </p><p>person, Cosmo Versal, who disgraces a once honored </p><p>name with his childish attempt to create a sensation </p><p>that may cause untold harm among the ignorant </p><p>masses," had laid himself open to criminal prose- </p><p>cution. </p><p> In their latest editions, several of the papers</p><p>printed an interview with Cosmo Versal, in which </p><p>he gave figures and calculations that, on their face, </p><p>seemed to offer mathematical proof of the correct- </p><p>ness of his forecast. In impassioned language, he </p><p>implored the public to believe that he would not </p><p>mislead them, spoke of the instant necessity of con- </p><p>structing arks of safety, and averred that the pres- </p><p>ence of the terrible nebula that was so soon to </p><p>drown the world was already manifest in the hea- </p><p>vens. </p><p> Some readers of these confident statements began</p><p>to waver, especially when confronted with mathe- </p><p>matics which they could not understand. But still, </p><p>in general, the laugh went on. It broke into boister- </p><p>ousness in one of the largest theaters where a </p><p>bright-witted “artist,” who always made a point of </p><p>hitting off the very latest sensation, got himself </p><p>up in a lifelike imitation of the well-known figure </p><p>of Cosmo Versal, topped with a bald head as big as </p><p>a bushel, and sailed away into the flies with a pretty </p><p>member of the ballet, whom he had gallantly snatch- </p><p>ed from a tumbling ocean of green baize, singing </p><p>at the top of his voice until they disappeared behind </p><p>the proscenium arch: </p><p> “Oh, th’ Nebula is coming</p><p> To drown the wicked earth,</p><p> With all his spirals humming</p><p> ’S he waltzes in his mirth.</p><p>Chorus. </p><p> “Don’t hesitate a second,</p><p> Get ready to embark,</p><p> And skip away to safety</p><p> With Cosmo and his ark.</p><p>THE SECOND DELUGE </p><p>681 </p><p> “Th’ Nebula’s a direful bird</p><p> ’S he skims the ether blue!</p><p>He’s angry over what he’s heard, </p><p>’N’s got his eye on you. </p><p>Chorus. </p><p>“Don’t hesitate a second, etc. </p><p> “When Nebulas begin to pipe</p><p> The bloorain ILO</p><p> Y’bet yer life the time is ripe</p><p> To think what you will do.</p><p>Chorus. </p><p>“Don’t hesitate a second, etc. </p><p>“He’ll tip th’ Atlantic o’er its brim, </p><p>And swamp the mountains tall; </p><p>He’ll let the broad Pacific in, </p><p>And leave no land at all. </p><p>Chorus. </p><p>“Don’t hesitate a second, etc. </p><p>“He’s got an option on the spheres; </p><p>He’s leased the milky way; </p><p>He’s caught the planets in arrears, </p><p>’N’s bound to make ’em pay, </p><p>Chorus. </p><p>“Don’t hesitate a second, etc. </p><p>The roars of laughter and applause with which </p><p>this effusion of vaudeville genius was greeted, show- </p><p>ed the cheerful spirit in which the public took the </p><p>affair. No harm seemed to have come to the “ignor- </p><p>ant masses” yet. </p><p>But the next morning there was a suspicious </p><p>change in the popular mind. People were surprised </p><p>to see the new posters in place of the old ones, more </p><p>lurid in letters and language than the original. The</p><p>morning papers had columns of description and </p><p>comment, and some of them seemed disposed to </p><p>treat the prophet and his prediction with a certain </p><p>degree of seriousness. </p><p>The servants who had been interviewed overnight, </p><p>did not talk very convincingly, and made the mis- </p><p>take of flinging contempt on both Cosmo and “the </p><p>gullible public.” </p><p>Naturally, the public wouldn’t stand for that, and </p><p>the pendulum of opinion began to swing the other </p><p>way. Cosmo helped his cause by sending to every </p><p>newspaper a carefully prepared statement of his </p><p>observations and calculations, in which he spoke </p><p>with such force of conviction that few could read </p><p>his words without feeling a thrill of apprehensive </p><p>uncertainty. This was strengthened by published </p><p>despatches which showed that he had forwarded his </p><p>warnings to all the well-known scientific bodies of </p><p>the world, which, while decrying them, made no </p><p>effective response. </p><p>And there was a note of positive alarm in ai </p><p>doubled-leaded bulletin from the new observatory at </p><p>Mount McKinley, which affirmed that during the </p><p>preceding night a singular obscurity had been sus- </p><p>pected in the northern sky, seeming to veil many </p><p>stars below the twelfth magnitude. It was added </p><p>that the phenomenon was unprecedented, but that </p><p>the observation was both difficult and uncertain. </p><p> Nowhere was the atmosphere of doubt and my-</p><p>stery, which now began to hang over the public, so </p><p>remarkable as in Wall Street. The sensitive cur- </p><p>rents there responded like electric waves to the new </p><p>influence, and, to the dismay of hard-headed ob- </p><p>servers, the market dropped as if it had been hit </p><p>with a sledge-hammer. Stocks went down five, ten, </p><p>in some cases twenty points in as many minutes. </p><p> The speculative issue slid down like wheat into a</p><p>bin when the chutes are opened. Nobody could </p><p>trace the exact origin of the movement, but selling- </p><p>orders came tumbling in until there was a veritable </p><p>panic.	. /</p><p> From London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Leningrad,</p><p>flashed dispatches announcing that the same unrea- </p><p>sonable slump had manifested itself there, and all </p><p>united in holding Cosmo Versal solely responsible for </p><p>the foolish break in prices. Leaders of finance rush- </p><p>ed to the exchanges trying by arguments and ex- </p><p>postulations to arrest the downfall, but in vain. </p><p> In the afternoon, however, reason partially re-</p><p>sumed its sway; then a quick recovery was felt, and</p><p>many who had rushed to sell all they had, found </p><p>cause to regret their precipitancy. The next day all </p><p>was on the mend, as far as the stock market was </p><p>concerned, but among the people at large the poison </p><p>of awakened credulity continued to spread, nourish- </p><p>ed by fresh announcements from the fountain head. </p><p> Cosmo issued another statement to the effect that</p><p>he had perfected plans for an ark of safety, which </p><p>he would begin at once to construct in the neigh- </p><p>borhood of New York, and he not only offered freely </p><p>to give his plans to any who wished to commence </p><p>construction on their owii account, but he urged </p><p>them, in the name of Heaven, to lose no time. This </p><p>produced a prodigious effect, and multitudes began </p><p>to be infected with a nameless fear. </p><p> Meanwhile an extraordinary scene occurred, be-</p><p>hind closed doors, at the headquarters of the Car- </p><p>negie Institution in Washington. Joseph Smith, </p><p>actng under Cosmo Versal’s direction, had for- </p><p>warded an elaborate precis of the latter’s argu- </p><p>ment, accompanied with full mathematical details, </p><p>to the head of the institution. The character of this </p><p>document was such that it could not be ignored. </p><p>Moreover, the savants composing the council of the </p><p>most important scientific association in the world </p><p>were aware of the state of the public mind, and </p><p>felt that it was incumbent upon them to do some- </p><p>thing to allay the alarm. Of late years a sort of </p><p>supervisory control over scientific news of all kinds </p><p>had been accorded to them, and they appreciated </p><p>the fact that a duty now rested upon their shoulders. </p><p> Accordingly, a special meeting was called to con-</p><p>sider the communication from Cosmo Versal. It </p><p>was the general belief that a little critical examin- </p><p>ation would result in complete proof of the fallacy </p><p>of all his work, proof which could be put in a form </p><p>that the most uninstructed would understand. </p><p> But the papers, diagrams, and mathematical</p><p>formulas had no sooner been spread upon the table </p><p>under the knowing eyes of the learned members of </p><p>•	the council, than a chill of conscious impuissance</p><p>ran through them. They saw that Cosmo's mathe- </p><p>682 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>zcatics were unimpeachable. His formulae were ac- </p><p>curately deduced, and his operations absolutely </p><p>correct. </p><p> They could do nothing but attack his fundamental</p><p>data, based on the alleged revelations of his -new </p><p>kind of spectroscope, and on telescopic observations </p><p>which were described in so much detail that the </p><p>only way to combat them was by the general asser- </p><p>tion that they were illusory. This was felt to be a </p><p>very unsatisfactory method of procedure, as far as </p><p>the public was concerned, because it amounted to no </p><p>more than attacking the credibility of a witness who </p><p>pretended to describe only what he himself had seen </p><p>■—and there is nothing so hard as to prove a nega- </p><p>tive. </p><p> Then, Cosmo had on his side the whole force of</p><p>that curious tendency of the human mind which </p><p>habitually gravitates toward whatever is extraor- </p><p>dinary, revolutionary, and mysterious. </p><p> But a yet greater difficulty arose. Mention has</p><p>been made of the strange bulletin from the Mount </p><p>McKinley observatory. -That had been incau- </p><p>tiously sent out to the public by a thoughtless ob- </p><p>server, who was more intent upon describing a sin- </p><p>gular phenomenon than upon considering its possible </p><p>effect on the popular imagination. He had imme- </p><p>diately received an expostulatory despatch from </p><p>headquarters which henceforth shut his mouth—but </p><p>he had told the simple truth, and how embarrassing </p><p>that was became evident when, on the very table </p><p>around which the savants were now assembled, three </p><p>despatches were laid in quick succession from the </p><p>great observatories of Mount Hekla in Iceland, the </p><p>North Cape, and Kamchatka, all corroborating the </p><p>statement of the Mount McKinley observer, that an </p><p>inexplicable veiling of faint stars had manifested </p><p>itself in the boreal quarter of the sky </p><p>When the president read the despatches—which </p><p>the senders had taken the precaution to mai'k “confi- </p><p>dential”—the members of the council looked at one </p><p>another with no little dismay. Here was the most </p><p>unprejudiced corroboration of Cosmo Versal’s as- </p><p>sertion that the great nebula was already within the </p><p>range of observation. How could they dispute such </p><p>testimony, and what were they to make of it? </p><p> Two or three of the members began to be shaken</p><p>in their convictions. </p><p> “Upon my word,” exclaimed Professor Alexander</p><p>Jones, “but this is very curious! And suppose the </p><p>fellow should be right, after all?”</p><p> “Right!” cried the president, Professor Pludder,</p><p>disdainfully. “Who ever heard of a watery nebula? </p><p>The thing’s absurd!” </p><p> “I don’t see that it’s absurd,” replied Prof. Jones.</p><p>“There’s plenty of proof of the existence of hy- </p><p>drogen in some of the nebulae.” </p><p> “So there is,” chimed in Prof. Abel Able, “and if</p><p>there’s hydrogen, there may be oxygen, and there </p><p>you have all that’s necessary. It’s not the idea that </p><p>a nebula may consist of watery vapor that’s absurd, </p><p>but it is that a watery nebula, large enough to </p><p>drown the earth by condensation upon it could have </p><p>approached so near as this one must now be without </p><p>sooner betraying its presence.” </p><p> “How so?” demanded a voice.</p><p> “By its attraction. Cosmo Vers&amp;l says it is al-</p><p>ready less than three hundred million miles away. </p><p>If it is massive enough to drown the earth, it ought </p><p>long ago to have been discovered by its disturbance </p><p>of the planetary orbits.” </p><p> “Not at all,” exclaimed Professor Jeremiah Moses.</p><p>“If you stick to that argument you’ll be drowned </p><p>sure. Just look at these facts. The earth weighs </p><p>six and a half sextillions of tons, and the ocean one </p><p>and a half quintillions. The average depth of the </p><p>oceans is two' and one-fifth miles. Now—if the level </p><p>of the ocean were raised only about 1,600 feet, prac- </p><p>tically all the inhabited parts of the world would be </p><p>flooded. To cause that increase in the level of the </p><p>oceans only about one-eighth part would have to be </p><p>added to their total mass, or, say, one-seventh part, </p><p>allowing for the greater surface to be covered. That </p><p>would be one thirty-thousandth of the weight of the </p><p>globe, and if you suppose that only one-hundredth </p><p>of the entire nebula were condensed on the earth, </p><p>the whole mass of the nebula would not need to ex- </p><p>ceed one three-hundredth of the weight of the earth, </p><p>or a quarter that of the moon—and nobody here will </p><p>be bold enough to say that the approach of a mass </p><p>no greater than that would be likely to be discov- </p><p>ered through its attraction when it was three hun- </p><p>dred million miles away.” </p><p> Several of the astronomers present shook their</p><p>heads at this, and Professor Pludder irritably de- </p><p>clared that it was absurd. </p><p> “The attraction would be noticeable when it was</p><p>a thousand millions of miles away,” he continued. </p><p> “Yes, ‘noticeable’ I admit,” replied Professor</p><p>Moses, “but all the same you wouldn’t notice it, be- </p><p>cause you wouldn’t be looking for it unless the </p><p>nebula were visible first, and even then it would re- </p><p>quire months of observation to detect the effects. </p><p>And how are you going to get around, those bulle- </p><p>tins ? The thing is beginning to be visible now, and </p><p>I’ll bet that if, from this time on, you study care- </p><p>fully the planetary motions, you will find evidence of </p><p>the disturbance becoming stronger and stronger. </p><p>Vers&amp;l has pointed out that very thing, and calcu- </p><p>lated the perturbations. This thing has come like a </p><p>thief in the night.” </p><p> You’d better hurry up and secure a place in the</p><p>ark,” said Professor Pludder sarcastically. </p><p> “I don’t know but I shall, if I can get one,” re-</p><p>turned Professor Moses. “You may not think this </p><p>is such a laughing matter a few months hence.” </p><p> “I’m surprised,” pursued the president, “that a</p><p>man of your scientific standing should stultify him- </p><p>self by taking seriously such balderdash as this. I </p><p>tell you the thing is absurd.” </p><p> “And I tell you, you are absurd to say so!” re-</p><p>torted Professor Moses, losing his temper. You’ve </p><p>got four of the biggest telescopes in the world under </p><p>your control; why don’t you order your observers </p><p>to look for this thing?” </p><p> Professor Pludder, who was a very big man, rear-</p><p>ed up his rotund form, and, bringing his fist down </p><p>upon the table with a resounding whack, exclaimed: </p><p>“I’ll do nothing so ridiculous! These bulletins </p><p>have undoubtedly been influenced by the popular </p><p>excitement. There has possibly been a little ob- </p><p>scurity in the atmosphere—cirrus clouds, or some- </p><p>thing—and the observers have imagined the rest. </p><p>I’m not going to insult science by encouraging the </p><p>proceedings of a mountebank like Cosmo Vers&amp;l. </p><p>THE SECOND DELUGE </p><p>683 </p><p>What we’ve got to do is to prepare a despatch for </p><p>the press reassuring the populace and throwing the </p><p>weight of this institution on the side of common </p><p>sense and public tranquillity. Let the secretary in- </p><p>dite such a despatch, and then we’ll edit it and send </p><p>it out.” </p><p> Professor Pludder, naturally dictatorial, was</p><p>sometimes a little overbearing, but being a man of </p><p>great ability, and universally respected for his high </p><p>rank in the scientific world, his colleagues usually </p><p>bowed to his decisions. On this occasion his force </p><p>of character sufficed to silence the doubters, and </p><p>when the statement intended for the press had re- </p><p>ceived its final touches it contained no hint of the </p><p>seeds of discord that Cosmo Versal had sown among </p><p>America’s foremost savants. The next morning it </p><p>appeared in all the newspapers as follows: </p><p> Official statement from the Carnegie Institute.</p><p> In consequence of the popular excitement</p><p> caused by the sensational utterances of a no-</p><p> torious pretender to scientific knowledge in</p><p> New York, the council of this institution au-</p><p> thorizes the statement that it has examined</p><p> the alleged grounds on which prediction of a</p><p> great flood, to be caused by a nebula encounter-</p><p> ing the earth, is based, and finds, as all real</p><p> men of science knew beforehand, that the en-</p><p> tire matter is simply a canard.</p><p> The nebulas are not composed of water; if</p><p> they were composed of water they could not</p><p> cause a flood on the earth; the report that some</p><p> strange, misty object is visible in the starry</p><p> heavens is based on a misapprehension; and</p><p> finally, the so-called calculations of the author</p><p> of this inexcusable hoax are baseless and to-</p><p> tally devoid of scientific validity.</p><p> The public is earnestly advised to pay no</p><p> further attention to the matter. If there were</p><p> any danger to the earth—and such a thing is</p><p> not to be seriously considered—astronomers</p><p> would know it long in advance, and would give</p><p> due and official warning.</p><p> Unfortunately for the popular effect of this pro-</p><p>nouncement, on the very morning when it appeared </p><p>in print, thirty thousand people were crowded </p><p>around the old aviation field at Mineola, excitedly </p><p>watching Cosmo Versal, with five hundred work- </p><p>men, laying the foundation of a huge platform, </p><p>while about the field were stretched sheets of can-</p><p>yas displaying the words: </p><p>THE ARK OF SAFETY. </p><p>Earnest Inspection Invited for All. </p><p>Attendants will Furnish Gratis Plans for Similar </p><p>Constructions. </p><p>Small Arks Can Be Built for Families. </p><p>Act While There Is Yet Time. </p><p> The multitude saw at a glance that here was a</p><p>work that would cost millions, and the spectacle of </p><p>this immense expenditure, the evidence that Cosmo </p><p>was backing his words with his money, furnished a </p><p>silent argument which was irresistible. In the </p><p>midst of all, flying about among his men, was Cosmo, </p><p>impressing every beholder with the feeling that in- </p><p>tellect was in charge. </p><p> Like the gray coat of Napoleon on a battle-field,</p><p>the sign of that mighty brow bred confidence. </p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>The First Drops of the Deluge </p><p>THE utterance of the Carnegie Institution </p><p>indeed fell flat, and Cosmo Versal’s star </p><p>reigned in the ascendent. He pushed his </p><p>preparations with amazing speed, and not only </p><p>politics, but even the war that had just broken out </p><p>in south America were swallowed up in the news- </p><p>papers by endless descriptions of the mysterious </p><p>proceedings at Mineola. Cosmo still found time </p><p>every day to write articles and to give out inter- </p><p>views; and Joseph Smith was kept constantly on </p><p>the jump, running for street-cars or trains, or leap- </p><p>ing, with his long coat flapping, into and out of </p><p>elevators on ceaseless missions to the papers, the </p><p>scientific societies, and the meetings of learned or </p><p>unlearned bodies which' had been persuaded to in- </p><p>vestigate the subject of the coming flood. Between </p><p>the work of preparation and that of proselytism it </p><p>is difficult to see how Cosmo found sleep. </p><p> Day by day the Ark of Safety rose higher upon its</p><p>great platform, its huge metallic ribs and broad, </p><p>bulging sides glinting strangely in the unbroken </p><p>sunshine—for, as if imitating the ominous quiet be- </p><p>fore an earthquake, the July sky had stripped itself </p><p>of all clouds. No thunder-storms broke the serenity </p><p>of the long days, and never had the overarching </p><p>heavens seemed so spotless and motionless in their </p><p>cerulean depths. </p><p> A1 over the world, as the news despatches showed,</p><p>the same strange calm prevailed. Cosmo did not </p><p>fail to call attention to this unparalleled repose of </p><p>nature as a sure prognostic of the awful event in </p><p>preparation. </p><p> The heat became tremendous. Hundreds were</p><p>stricken down in the blazing streets. Multitudes </p><p>fled to the seashore, and lay panting under um- </p><p>brellas on the burning sands, or vainly sought re- </p><p>lief by plunging into the heated water, which, </p><p>rolling lazily in with the tide, felt as if it had come </p><p>from over a boiler. </p><p> Still, perspiring crowds constantly watched the</p><p>workmen, who struggled with the overpowering </p><p>heat, although Cosmo had erected canvas screens </p><p>for them and installed a hundred immense electric </p><p>fans to create a breeze. </p><p> Beginning with five hundred men, he had, in less</p><p>than a month, increased his force to nearer five </p><p>thousand, many of whom, not engaged in the actual </p><p>construction, were preparing the materials and </p><p>bringing them together. The Ark was being made </p><p>of pure levium, the wonderful new metal which, </p><p>although already employed in the construction of </p><p>airplanes and the framework of dirigible balloons, </p><p>had not before been used for shipbuilding, except in </p><p>the case of a few small boats, and these only </p><p>in the navy. </p><p> For mere raw material Cosmo must have expend-</p><p>ed an enormous sum, and his expenses were quad- </p><p>rupled by the fact that he was compelled, in order </p><p>to save time, practically to lease several of the </p><p>largest steel plants in the country. Fortunately </p><p>levium was easily rolled into plates, and the supply </p><p>634 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>■was sufficient, owing to the discovery two years </p><p>before of an expeditious process of producing the </p><p>metal from its ores. </p><p> The radio, telegraph and telephone offices were</p><p>besieged by correspondents eager to send inland, </p><p>and all over Europe and Asia, the latest particulars </p><p>of the consti'uction of the great ark. Nobody fol- </p><p>lowed Cosmo's advice or example, but everybody </p><p>was intensely interested and puzzled. </p><p> At last the government officials found themselves</p><p>forced to take cognizance of the affair. They could </p><p>no longer ignore it after they discovered that it was </p><p>seriously interfering with the conduct of public </p><p>business. Cosmo Versal’s pressing orders, accom- </p><p>panied by cash, displaced or delayed orders of the </p><p>government commanding materials for the navy and </p><p>the air fleet. In consequence, about the middle of </p><p>July he received a summons to visit the President </p><p>of the United States. Cosmo hurried to Washing- </p><p>ton on the given date, and presented his card at the </p><p>White House. He was shown immediately into the </p><p>President’s reception-room, where he found the en- </p><p>tire Cabinet in presence. As he entered he was the </p><p>focus of a formidable battery of curious and not </p><p>too friendly eyes. </p><p> President Samson was a large, heavy man, more</p><p>than six feet tall. Every member of the Cabinet </p><p>was above the average in avoirdupois, and the </p><p>heavy-weight president of the Carnegie Institution, </p><p>Professor Pludder, who had been specially invited, </p><p>added by his presence to the air of ponderosity </p><p>that characterized the assemblage. All seemed </p><p>magnified by the thin white garments which they </p><p>wore on account of the oppressive heat. Many of </p><p>them had come in haste from various summer re- </p><p>sorts, and were plainly annoyed by the necessity of </p><p>attending at the President’s command. </p><p> Cosmo Vers&amp;l was the only cool man there, and</p><p>his diminutive form presented a striking contrast </p><p>to the others. But he looked as if he carried more </p><p>brains than all of them put together. </p><p> He was not in the least overawed by the hostile</p><p>glances of the statesmen. On the contrary, his lips </p><p>perceptibly curled, in a half-disdainful smile, as he </p><p>took the big hand which the President extended to </p><p>him. As soon as Cosmo Versal had sunk into the </p><p>embrace of a large easy chair, the President opened </p><p>the subject. </p><p> “I have directed you to come,” he said in a</p><p>majestic tone, “in order the sooner to dispel the </p><p>effects of your unjustifiable predictions and extra- </p><p>ordinary proceedings on the public mind—and, I </p><p>may add, on public affairs. Are you aware that you </p><p>have interfered with the measures of this govern- </p><p>ment for the defense of the country? You have </p><p>stepped in front of the government, and delayed the </p><p>beginning of four battle-ships which Congress has </p><p>authorized in urgent haste on account of the threat- </p><p>ening aspect of affairs in the East? I need hardly </p><p>say to you that we shall, if necessary, find means </p><p>to set aside the private agreements under which </p><p>you are proceeding, as inimical to public interests, </p><p>but you have already struck a serious blow at the </p><p>security of your country.” </p><p> The President pronounced the last sentence with</p><p>oratorical unction, and Cosmo was conscious of an </p><p>approving movement of big official shoulders around </p><p>him. The disdain deepened on his lips. </p><p> After a moment’s pause the President continued:</p><p>“Before proceeding to extremities I have wished </p><p>to see you personally, in order, in the first place, to </p><p>assure myself that you are mentally responsible, and </p><p>then to appeal to your patriotism, which should lead </p><p>you to withdraw at once an obstruction so dan- </p><p>gerous to the nation.' Do you know the position in </p><p>which you have placed yourself?” </p><p> Cosmo Versal got upon his feet and advanced to</p><p>the center of the room like a little David. Every </p><p>eye was fixed upon him. His voice was steady, but </p><p>intense with suppressed nervousness. </p><p> “Mr. President,” he said, “you have accused me</p><p>of obstructing the measures of the government for </p><p>the defense of the country. Sir, I am trying to save </p><p>the whole human race from a danger in comparison </p><p>with which that of war is infinitesimal—a danger </p><p>which is rushing down upon us with appalling </p><p>speed, and which will strike every land on the globe </p><p>simultaneously. Within seven months not a war- </p><p>ship or any other existing vessel will remain afloat.” </p><p>The listeners smiled, and nodded significantly to </p><p>one another, but the speaker only grew more </p><p>earnest. </p><p> “You think I am insane,” he said, “but the truth</p><p>is you are hoodwinked by official stupidity. That </p><p>man,” pointing to Professor Pludder, “who knows </p><p>me well, and who has had all my proofs laid before </p><p>him, is either too thick-headed to understand a </p><p>demonstration or too pig-headed to confess his own </p><p>error.” </p><p> “Come, come,” interrupted the President sternly,</p><p>while Professor Pludder flushed very red, “this will </p><p>not do! Indulge in no personalities here. I have </p><p>strained the point in offering to listen to you at all, </p><p>and I have invited the head of the greatest of our </p><p>scientific societies to be present, with the hope that </p><p>here, before us all, he might convince you of your </p><p>folly, and thus bring the whole unfortunate affair </p><p>promptly to an end.” </p><p> “He convince me!" cried Cosmo Versal disdain-</p><p>fully. “He is incapable of understanding the A, B, </p><p>C of my work. But let me tell you this, Mr. Presi- </p><p>dent—there are men in his own council who are not </p><p>so blind. I know what occurred at the recent meet- </p><p>ing of that council, and I know that the ridiculous </p><p>announcement put forth in its name to deceive the </p><p>public was whipped into shape by him, and does not </p><p>express the real opinion of many of the members.” </p><p>Professor Pludder’s face grew redder than ever. </p><p>“Name one!” he thundered. </p><p> “Ah,” said Cosmo sneeringly, “that hits hard,</p><p>doesn’t it? You want me to name one; well I’ll </p><p>name three.. What did Professor Alexander Jones </p><p>and Professor Abel Able say about the existence of </p><p>watery nebula?, and what was the opinion expressed </p><p>by Professor Jeremiah Moses about the actual ap- </p><p>proach of one out of the northern sky, and what it </p><p>could do if it hit the earth? What was the unani- </p><p>mous opinion of the entire council about the cor- </p><p>rectness of my mathematical work? And what,” </p><p>he continued, approaching Professor Pludder and </p><p>shaking his finger up at him—“what have you done </p><p>with those three despatches from Iceland, the </p><p>North Cape, and Kamchatka, which absolutely con* </p><p>THE SECOND DELUGE </p><p>685 </p><p>firmed my announcement that the nebula ■was al- </p><p>ready visible?” </p><p> Professor Pludder began stammeringly:</p><p> "Some spy—”</p><p> “Ah,” cried Cosmo,catching him up, “a spy, hey?</p><p>Then, you admit it! Mr. President, I beg you to </p><p>notice that he admits it. Sir, this is a conspiracy to </p><p>conceal the truth. Great Heavens, the world is on </p><p>the point of being drowned, and yet the pride of </p><p>officialism is so strong in this plodder—Pludder— </p><p>and others of his ilk that they’d sooner take the </p><p>chance of letting the human race be destroyed than </p><p>recognize the truth!” </p><p> Cosmo Versal spoke with such tremendous concen-</p><p>tration of mental energy, and with such evident </p><p>sincerity of conviction, and he had so plainly put </p><p>Professor Pludder to rout, that the President, no </p><p>less than.the other listening statesmen, was thrown </p><p>into a quandary. </p><p> There was a creaking of heavily burdened chairs,</p><p>a ponderous stir all round the circle, while a look </p><p>of perplexity became visible on every face. Pro- </p><p>fessor Pludder’s conduct helped to produce the </p><p>change of moral atmosphere. He had been so com- </p><p>pletely surprised by Cosmo’s accusation, based on </p><p>facts which he had supposed were known only to </p><p>himself and the council, that he was unable for a </p><p>minute to speak at all, and before he could align his </p><p>faculties his triumphant little opponent renewed </p><p>the attack. - </p><p> “Mr. President,” he said, laying his hand on the</p><p>arm of Mr. Samson’s big chair, which was nearly on </p><p>a level with his breast, and speaking with persua- </p><p>sive earnestness, “you are the executive head of a </p><p>mighty nation—the nation that sets the pace for the </p><p>world. It is in your power to do a vast, an in- </p><p>calculable, service to ‘humanity. One official word </p><p>from you would save millions upon millions of lives. </p><p>I implore you, instead .of interfering with my work, </p><p>to give instant order for the construction of as </p><p>many arks, based upon the plans I have perfected, </p><p>as the navy yard can possibly turn out. Issue a </p><p>proclamation to the people, warning them that this </p><p>is their only chance of escape.” </p><p> By a curious operation of the human mind, this</p><p>speech cost Cosmo nearly all the advantage that he </p><p>had previously gained. His ominous suggestion of </p><p>a great nebula rushing out of the heavens to over-</p><p>whelm the earth had immensely impressed the </p><p>imagination of his hearers, and his uncontradicted </p><p>accusation that Professor Pludder was concealing </p><p>the facts had almost convinced them that he was </p><p>right. But when he mentioned “arks,” the strain </p><p>was relieved, and a smile broke out on the broad </p><p>face of the President. He shook his head, and was </p><p>about to speak, when Cosmo, perceiving that he-had </p><p>lost ground, changed his tactics. </p><p> “Still you are incredulous!” he exclaimed. “But</p><p>the proof is before you! Look at the blazing </p><p>heavens! The annals of meteorology do not record </p><p>another such summer as this. The vanguard of the </p><p>fatal nebula is already upon us. The signs of dis- </p><p>aster are in the sky. But, note what I say—this </p><p>is only the first sign. There is another following </p><p>on its heels which may be -here at any moment. To </p><p>heat will succeed cold, and as we rush through the </p><p>tenuous outer spirals the earth will alternately be </p><p>whipped with tempests of snow and sleet, and </p><p>scorched by fierce outbursts of solar fire. For </p><p>three weeks the sun has been feeding its furnaces </p><p>with invisible vapor—but look out, I warn you, for </p><p>the change that is impending!” </p><p> These extraordinary words, pronounced with the</p><p>wild air of a prophet, completed the growing convic- </p><p>tion of the listeners that they really had a madman </p><p>to deal with, and Professor Pludder, having re- </p><p>covered his self-command, rose to his feet. </p><p> “Mr. President,” he began, “the evidence which</p><p>we have just seen of an unbalanced mind—” </p><p> He got no further. A pall of darkness suddenly</p><p>dropped upon the room. An inky curtain seemed to </p><p>have fallen from the sky. At the same time the win- </p><p>dows were shaken by tremendous blasts of wind, </p><p>and, as the electric lights were hastily turned on, </p><p>huge snowflakes, intermingled with rattling hail- </p><p>stones, were seen careering outside. In a few </p><p>seconds several large panes of glass were broken, </p><p>and the chilling wind, sweeping round the apart- </p><p>ment, made the teeth of the -thinly clad statesmen </p><p>chatter, while the noise of the storm became deaf- </p><p>ening. The sky lighted, but at the same moment </p><p>dreadful thunder-peals shook the building. Two or </p><p>three trees in the White House grounds were struck </p><p>by the bolts, and their broken branches were driven </p><p>through the air and carried high above the ground </p><p>by the whirling winds, and one of them was thrown </p><p>against the building with such force that for a </p><p>moment it seemed as if the’wall had been shattered. </p><p> After the first stunning effect of *this outbreak</p><p>of the elements had passed, everybody rushed to the</p><p>windows to look out— everybody except Cosmo </p><p>Versal, who remained standing in the center of the </p><p>room. </p><p> “I told you!” he said; but nobody listened to him.</p><p>What they saw outside absorbed every faculty. </p><p>The noise was so stunning that they could not have </p><p>heard him. </p><p> We have said that -the air lightened after the</p><p>passage of the first pall of darkness, but it w'as not </p><p>the reappearance of the sun that caused the bright- </p><p>ening. It was an awful light, which seemed to be </p><p>born out of the air itself. It had a menacing, cop- </p><p>pery hue, continually changing ’in character. The </p><p>whole 'upper atmosphere was choked with dense </p><p>clouds, which swirled and -tumbled, and twisted </p><p>themselves into great vortical rolls, .spinning like </p><p>gigantic mill-shafts. Once, one of these vortexes </p><p>shot downward, with projectile speed, rapidly as- </p><p>suming the terrible form of the trombe of a tornado, </p><p>and where it struck -the ground it tore everything to </p><p>pieces—trees, houses, the very earth itself, were </p><p>ground to powder and then whirled aloft by the </p><p>resistless suction. </p><p> Occasionally the darkness returned for a few</p><p>minutes, as if a cover had been clapped upon the </p><p>sky, and then, again, the murk would roll off, and </p><p>the reddish gleam would reappear. These swift </p><p>alternations of impenetrable gloom and unearthly </p><p>light shook the hearts of the dumfounded states- </p><p>men even more than the roar and rush of the storm. </p><p> A cry of horror broke from the onlookers when a</p><p>man and a woman suddenly appeared trying to cross </p><p>the White House grounds to reach a place of com </p><p>parative safety, and were caught up by the wind </p><p>686 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>clinging desperately to each other, and hurled </p><p>against a wall, at whose base they fell in a heap. </p><p> Then came another outburst of lightning, and a</p><p>vicious bolt descended upon the Washington Monu- </p><p>ment, and, twisting round it, seemed to envelope </p><p>the great shaft in a pulsating corkscrew of blinding </p><p>fire. The report that instantly followed made the </p><p>White House dance upon its foundations, and, as if </p><p>that had been a signal, the flood-gates of the sky </p><p>immediately opened, and rain so dense that it looked </p><p>like a solid cataract of water poured down upon the </p><p>earth. The raging water burst into the basement </p><p>of the building, and ran off in a shoreless river to- </p><p>ward the Potomac. </p><p> The streaming rain, still driven by the wind,</p><p>poured through the broken windows, driving the </p><p>President and the others to the middle of the room, </p><p>where they soon stood in rills of water soaking the </p><p>thick carpet. </p><p> They were all as pale as death. Their eyes</p><p>sought one another’s faces in dumb amazement. </p><p>Cosmo Versal alone retained perfect self-command. </p><p>In spite of his slight stature he looked their master. </p><p>Raising his voice to the highest pitch, in order to </p><p>be heard, he shouted: </p><p> “These are the first drops of the Deluge! Will</p><p>you believe now?” </p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>The World Swept With Terror </p><p>THE tempest of hail, snow, lightning, and rain, </p><p>which burst so unexpectedly over. Washing- </p><p>ton, was not a local phenomenon. It leveled </p><p>the antennae of the radio systems all over the world, </p><p>cutting off communication everywhere. Only the </p><p>submarine cables remained unaffected, and by them </p><p>was transmitted the most astonishing news of the </p><p>ravages of the storm. Rivers had careered over </p><p>their banks, low-lying towns were flooded, the </p><p>swollen sewers of cities exploded and inundated the </p><p>streets, and gradually news came in from country </p><p>districts showing that vast areas of land had been </p><p>submerged, and hundreds drowned. </p><p> The downfall of rain far exceeded everything that</p><p>the meteorological bureaus had ever recorded. </p><p> The vagaries of the lightning, and the frightful</p><p>power that it exhibited, were especially terrifying.</p><p> In London the Victoria Tower was partly dis-</p><p>mantled by a bolt. </p><p> In Moscow the ancient and beautiful Church of</p><p>St. Basil was nearly destroyed. </p><p> The celebrated Leaning Tower of Pisa, the wonder</p><p>of centuries, was flung to the ground. </p><p> The vast dome of St, Peter’s at Rome was said to</p><p>have been encased during three whole minutes with </p><p>a blinding armor of electric fire, though the only </p><p>harm done was the throwing down of a statue in </p><p>one of the chapels. </p><p> But, strangest freak of all, in New York a tre-</p><p>mendous bolt, which seems to have entered the </p><p>Pennsylvania tunnel on the Jersey side, followed </p><p>the rails under the river, throwing two trains from </p><p>the track, and, emerging in the great station in the </p><p>heart of the city, expanded into a rose-colored </p><p>sphere, which exploded with an awful report, and </p><p>blew the great roof to pieces. And yet, although the </p><p>fragments were scattered a dozen blocks away, </p><p>hundreds of persons who were in the stations suf- </p><p>fered no other injury than such as resulted from </p><p>being flung violently to the floor, or against the </p><p>walls. </p><p> Cosmo Versal’s great ark seemed charmed. Not</p><p>a single discharge of lightning occurred in its vicin- </p><p>ity, a fact which he attributed to the dielectric </p><p>properties of levium. Nevertheless, the wind car- </p><p>ried away all his screens and electric fans. </p><p> If this storm had continued the predicted deluge</p><p>would unquestionably have occurred at once, and </p><p>even its prophet would have perished through hav- </p><p>ing begun his preparations too late. But the dis- </p><p>turbed elements sank into repose as suddenly as they </p><p>had broken out with fury. The rain did not last, </p><p>in most places more than twenty-four hours, al- </p><p>though the atmosphere continued to be filled with </p><p>troubled clouds for a week. At the end of that time </p><p>the sun reappeared, as hot as before, and a spot- </p><p>less dome once more over-arched the earth; but </p><p>from this time the sky never resumed its former </p><p>brilliant azure—there was always a strange cop- </p><p>pery tinge, the sight of which was appalling, al- </p><p>though it gradually lost its first effect through </p><p>familiarity. </p><p> The indifference and derision with which Cosmo’s</p><p>predictions and elaborate preparations had hitherto </p><p>been regarded now vanished, and the world, in </p><p>spite of itself, shivered with vague apprehension.</p><p>No reassurances from those savants who still re- </p><p>fused to admit any validity in Cosmo Versal’s cal- </p><p>culations and deductions had any permanent effect </p><p>upon the public mind. </p><p> With amusing inconsequence people sold stocks</p><p>again, until all the exchanges were once more swept </p><p>with panic—and then put tlie money in their strong </p><p>boxes, as if they thought that the mere possession </p><p>of the lucre could protect them. They hugged the </p><p>money and remained deaf to Cosmo’s reiterated </p><p>advice to build arks with it. </p><p> After all, they were only terrified, not convinced,</p><p>and they felt that, somehow, everything would come </p><p>out right, now that they had their possessions well </p><p>in hand. </p><p> For, in spite of the scare, nobody really believed</p><p>that an actual deluge was coming. There might be </p><p>great floods, and great suffering and loss, but the </p><p>world was not going to be drowned! Such things </p><p>only occurred in early and dark ages. </p><p> Some nervous persons found comfort in the fact</p><p>that when the skies cleared after the sudden down- </p><p>pour brilliant rainbows were seen. Their hearts </p><p>bounded with joy. </p><p> “The ‘Bow of PromiseV ” they cried “Behold the</p><p>unvarying assurance that the world shall never </p><p>again be drowned.” </p><p> Then a great revival movement was set on foot,</p><p>starting in the Mississippi valley under the leader- </p><p>ship of an eloquent exhorter, who declared that, al- </p><p>though a false prophet had arisen, whose delusive </p><p>prediction was contrary to Scripture, yet it was true </p><p>that the world was about to be punished in unex- </p><p>pected ways for its many iniquities. </p><p> This movement rapidly spread all over the coun-</p><p>try, and was taken up in England and throughout </p><p>Protestant Europe, and soon prayers were offered </p><p>THE SECOND DELUGE </p><p>687 </p><p>in thousands of churches to avert the wrath of </p><p>Heaven. Multitudes thus found their fears turned </p><p>into a new direction, and by a strange reaction, </p><p>Cosmo Versal came to be regarded as a kind of </p><p>Antichrist who was seeking to mislead mankind. </p><p> Just at this juncture, to add to the dismay and</p><p>uncertainty, a grand and fearful comet suddenly ap- </p><p>peared. It came up unexpectedly from the south, </p><p>blazed brightly close beside the sun, even at noon- </p><p>day, and a few nights later was visible after sunset </p><p>with an immense fiery head and a broad curved tail </p><p>that seemed to pulsate from end to end. It was so </p><p>bright that it cast shadows at night, as distinct as </p><p>those made by the moon. No such cometary monster </p><p>had ever before been seen. People shuddered when </p><p>they looked at it. It moved with amazing speed, </p><p>sweeping across the firmament like a besom of </p><p>destruction. Calculation showed that it was not </p><p>more than 3,000,000 miles from the earth. </p><p> But one night the wonder and dread awakened</p><p>by the comet were magnified a hundredfold by an </p><p>occurrence so unexpected and extraordinary that </p><p>the spectators gasped in amazement. </p><p> The writer happens to have before him an entry</p><p>in a diary, which is, probably, the sole contemporary </p><p>record of this event. It was written in the city of </p><p>Washington by no less a person than Prof. Jeremiah </p><p>Moses, of the Council of the Carnegie Institution. </p><p>Let it tell its own story: </p><p> “A marvelous thing happened this night. I</p><p>walked out into the park near my house with the </p><p>intention of viewing the great comet. The park </p><p>on my side (the west), is bordered with a dense </p><p>screen of tall trees, and I advanced toward the open </p><p>place in the center in order to have an unobstructed </p><p>sight of the flaming stranger. As I passed across </p><p>the edge of the shadow of the trees—the ground </p><p>ahead being brilliantly illuminated by the light of </p><p>the comet—I suddenly noticed, with an involuntary </p><p>start, that I was being preceded by a double shadow, </p><p>which forked away from my feet. </p><p> “I cast my eyes behind me to find the cause of</p><p>the phenomenon, and saw, to my inexpressible </p><p>amazement, that the comet had divided into two. </p><p>There were two distinct heads, already widely separ- </p><p>ated, but each, it seemed to me, as brilliant as the </p><p>original one had been, and each supplied with a </p><p>vast plume of fire a hundred degrees in length, and </p><p>consequently stretching far past the zenith. The </p><p>cause of the double shadow was evident at once—</p><p>but what can have produced this sudden disruption </p><p>of the comet? It must have occurred since last </p><p>evening, and already, if the calculated distance of </p><p>the comet is correct, the parts of the severed head </p><p>are 300,000 miles asunder!” </p><p> Underneath this entry was scribbled:</p><p> “Can this have anything to do with Cosmo Ver-</p><p>sal’s flood?” </p><p> Whether it had anything to do with the flood or</p><p>not, at any rate the public believed that it had. </p><p>People went about with fear written on their faces. </p><p> The double shadoivs had a surprising effect. The</p><p>phantasm was pointed out, and stared at with super- </p><p>stitious terror by thousands every night. The fact </p><p>that there was nothing really mysterious about it </p><p>made no difference. Even those who knew well that </p><p>it was an inevitable optical result of the division </p><p>of the bright comet were thrilled with instinctive </p><p>dread when they saw that forked shadow, mimick- </p><p>ing their every movement. There is nothing that </p><p>so upsets the mind as a sudden change in the as- </p><p>pect of familiar things. </p><p> The astronomers now took their turn. Those who</p><p>were absolutely incredulous about Casmo's predic- </p><p>tion, and genuinely desirious of allaying the popular </p><p>alarm, issued statements in which, with a disin- </p><p>genuousness that may have been unintentional, they </p><p>tried to sidetrack his arguments. </p><p> Professor Pludder led the way with a pronuncia-</p><p>mento declaring that “the absurd vaporings of the </p><p>modern Nostradamus of New York” had now demon- </p><p>strated their own emptiness. </p><p> “A comet,” said Professor Pludder, with reassur-</p><p>ing seriousness, “cannot down the earth. It is </p><p>composed of rare gases, which, as the experience </p><p>of Hailey’s comet many years ago showed, are un- </p><p>able to penetrate the atmosphere even when an </p><p>actual encounter occurs. In this case there cannot </p><p>even be an encounter; the comet is now moving </p><p>away. Its division is not an unprecedented, occur- </p><p>rence, for many previous comets have met with </p><p>similar accidents. This comet happened to be of </p><p>unusual size, and the partition of the head occurred </p><p>when it was relatively near-by—whence the start- </p><p>ling phenomena observed. There is nothing to be </p><p>feared.” </p><p> It will be remarked that Professor Pludder en-</p><p>tirely avoided the real issue. Cosmo Versal had </p><p>never said that the comet would drown the earth.</p><p>In fact, he had been as much surprised by its ap- </p><p>pearance as everybody else. But when he read </p><p>Professor Pludder’s statement, followed by others </p><p>of similar import, he took up the cudgels with a </p><p>vengeance. All over the world, translated into a </p><p>dozen languages, he scattered his reply, and the </p><p>effect was startling. </p><p> “My fellow-citizens of the world in all lands, and</p><p>of every race,” he began, “you are face to face with </p><p>destruction! And yet, while its heralds are plainly </p><p>signaling from the sky, and shaking the earth with </p><p>lightning to awaken it, blind leaders of the blind </p><p>try to deceive you! </p><p> “They are defying science itself!</p><p> “They say that the comet cannot touch the earth.</p><p>That is true. It is passing away. I myself did not </p><p>foresee its coming. It arrived by accident, but </p><p>every step that it has made through the silent </p><p>depths of space has been a proclamation of the </p><p>presence of the nebtda, which is the real agent of </p><p>the perdition of the world! </p><p> “Why that ominous redness which overcasts the</p><p>heavens? You have all noticed it. Why that blind- </p><p>ing brightness which the comet has displayed, ex- </p><p>ceeding all that has ever been beheld in such visitors. </p><p>The explanation is plain: the comet has been feed~. </p><p>ing on the substance of the nebida, which is rare </p><p>yet because we have only encountered some of its </p><p>outlying spirals. </p><p> “But it is coming on with terrible speed. In a</p><p>few short months we shall be plunged into its awful </p><p>688 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>center, and then the oceans will swell to the moun- </p><p>tain-tops, and the continents will become the bottom </p><p>of angry seas. </p><p> “When the flood begins it will be too late to save</p><p>yourselves. You have already lost too much precious </p><p>time. I tell you solemnly that not one in a million </p><p>can now be saved. Throw away every other con- </p><p>sideration, and try, try desperately, to be of the </p><p>little company of those who escape! </p><p> “Remember that your only chance is in building</p><p>arks—arks of levium, the metal that floats. I have </p><p>sent broadcast plans for such arks. They can be </p><p>made of any size, but the larger the better. In my </p><p>own ark I can take only a selected number, and </p><p>when the complement is made up not another soul </p><p>will be admitted. </p><p> “I have established all my facts by mathematical</p><p>proofs. The most expert mathematicians of the </p><p>world have been unable to detect any error in my </p><p>calculations. They try to dispute the data, but the </p><p>data are already before you for your own judg- </p><p>ment. The heavens are so obscured that only the </p><p>brightest stars can now be seen.” (This was a </p><p>fact which had caused bewilderment in the observa- </p><p>tories.) “The recent outburst of storms and floods </p><p>was the second sign of the approaching end, and </p><p>the third sign will not be long delayed—and after </p><p>that the deluge!” </p><p> It is futile to try to describe the haunting fear v</p><p>and horror which seized 'upon the majority of the </p><p>millions who read these words. Business was para- </p><p>lyzed, for men found it impossible to concentrate </p><p>their minds upon ordinary affairs. Every night the </p><p>twin comets, still very bright, although they were </p><p>fast retreating, brandished their fiery scimitars in </p><p>the sky—more fearful to the imagination now, since </p><p>Cosmo Versal had declared that it was the nebula </p><p>that stimulated their energies. And by day the </p><p>sky was watched with anxious eyes striving to </p><p>detect signs of a deepening of the menacing hue, </p><p>which, to an excited fancy, suggested a tinge of </p><p>blood. </p><p> Now, at last, Cosmo’s warnings and entreaties</p><p>bore practical fruit. Men began to inquire about </p><p>places in his ark, and to make preparations for </p><p>building arks of their own. </p><p> He had not been interfered with after his memor-</p><p>able interview with the President of the United </p><p>States, and had pushed his work at Mineola with</p><p>redoubled energy, employing night gangs of work- </p><p>men so that progress was continuous throughout </p><p>the twenty-four hours. </p><p> Standing on its platform, the ark, whose hull was</p><p>approaching completion, rose a hundred feet into </p><p>the air. It was 800 feet long and 250 broad—pro- </p><p>portions which practical ship-builders ridiculed, but </p><p>Cosmo, as original in this as in everything else, </p><p>declared that, taking into account the buoyancy of </p><p>levium, no other form would answer as well. He </p><p>estimated that when its great engines were in place, </p><p>its immense stores of material for producing power, </p><p>its ballast, and its supplies of food stowed away, and </p><p>its cargo of men and animals taken aboard, it would </p><p>not draw more than twenty feet of water. </p><p> Hardly a day passed now without somebody com-</p><p>ing to Cosmo to inquire about the best method </p><p>of constructing arks. He gave the required in- </p><p>formation, in all possible detail, with the utmost </p><p>willingness. He drew plans and sketches, made all </p><p>kinds of practical suggestions, and never failed </p><p>to urge the utmost haste. He inspired every visitor </p><p>at the same time with alarm and a resolution to go </p><p>to work at once. </p><p> Some did go to work. But their progress was</p><p>slow, and as days passed, and the comets gradually </p><p>faded out of sight, and then the dome of the sky </p><p>showed a tendency to resume its natural blueness, </p><p>the enthusiasm of Cosmo’s imitators weakened, to- </p><p>gether with their confidence in his prophetic powers. </p><p> They concluded to postpone their operations until</p><p>the need of arks should become more evident. </p><p> As to those who had sent inquiries about places</p><p>in Cosmo’s ark, now that the danger seemed to </p><p>be blowing away, they did not even take the trouble </p><p>to acknowledge the very kind responses that he had </p><p>made. </p><p> It is a singular circumstance that not one of these</p><p>anxious inquirers seemed to have paid particular at- </p><p>tention to a very significant sentence in his reply. </p><p>If they had given it a little thought, it would pro- </p><p>bably have set them pondering although they </p><p>might have been more puzzled than edified. The </p><p>sentence ran as follows: </p><p> “While assuring you that my ark has been built</p><p>for the benefit of my fellow men, I am bound to tell </p><p>you that I reserve absolutely the right to determine </p><p>who are truly representative of homo sapiens ” </p><p> The fact was that Cosmo had been turning over</p><p>in his mind the. great fundamental question which </p><p>he had asked himself when the idea of trying to </p><p>save the human race from annihilation had first </p><p>occurred to him, and apparently he had fixed upon </p><p>certain principles that were to guide him. </p><p> Since, when the mind is under great strain</p><p>through fear, the slightest relaxation, caused by </p><p>an apparently favorable change, produces a rebound </p><p>of hope, as unreasoning as the preceding terror, so </p><p>on this occasion, the vanishing of the comets, and </p><p>the fading of the disquieting color of the sky, had </p><p>a wonderful effect in restoring public confidence </p><p>in the orderly procession of nature. </p><p> Cosmo Versal’s vogue as a prophet of disaster was</p><p>soon gone, and once more everybody began to laugh </p><p>at him. People turned again to their neglected </p><p>affairs with the general remark that they “guessed </p><p>the world would manage to wade through.” </p><p> Those who had begun preparations to build arks</p><p>looked very sheepish when their friends guyed </p><p>them about their childish credulity. </p><p> Then a feeling of angry resentment arose, and</p><p>one day Cosmo Versal was mobbed in the street, </p><p>and the gamins threw stones at him. </p><p> People forgot the extraordinary storm of light-</p><p>ning and rain, the split comet, and all the other cir- </p><p>cumstances which, a little time before, had filled </p><p>them with terror. </p><p> But they were making a fearful mistake!</p><p> With eyes blindfolded, they were walking straight</p><p>into the jaws of destruction. </p><p> Without warning, and as suddenly almost as an</p><p>explosion, the third sign appeared, and on its heel </p><p>came a veritable Reign of Terror! </p><p>THE SECOND DELUGE </p><p>689 </p><p>CHAPTER V </p><p>The Third Sign </p><p>IN the middle of the night, at New York, hun- </p><p>dreds of thousands simultaneously awoke with </p><p>a feeling of suffocation. </p><p> They struggled, for breath as if they had suddenly</p><p>been plunged into a steam bath. </p><p> The air was hot, heavy, and terribly oppressive.</p><p>The throwing open of windows brought no relief. </p><p>The outer air was as stifling as that within. </p><p> It was so dark that, on looking out, one could not</p><p>see his own doorsteps. The arc lamps in the street </p><p>flickered with an ineffective blue gleam which shed </p><p>no illumination round about. </p><p> House lights, when turned on, looked like tiny _</p><p>candles enclosed in thick blue globes. </p><p> Frightened men and women stumbled around in</p><p>the gloom of their chambers trying to dress them- </p><p>selves. </p><p> Cries and exclamations rang from room to room;</p><p>children wailed; hysterical mothers ran wildly </p><p>hither and thither, seeking their little ones. Many </p><p>fainted, partly through terror and partly from the </p><p>difficulty of breathing. Sick persons, seized with a </p><p>terrible oppression of the chest, gasped, and never </p><p>rose from their beds. </p><p> At every window, and in every doorway, through-</p><p>out the vast city, invisible heads and forms were </p><p>crowded, making their presence known by their </p><p>voices—distracted householders striving to peer </p><p>through the strange darkness, and to find out tfie </p><p>cause of these terrifying phenomena. </p><p> Some managed to get a faint glimpse of their</p><p>watches by holding them close against lamps, and </p><p>thus noted the time. It was two o’clock in the </p><p>morning. </p><p> Neighbors, unseen, called to one another, but got</p><p>little comfort from the replies. </p><p> “What is it? In God’s name, what has happened?”</p><p> “I don’t know. I can hardly breathe.”</p><p> “It is awful! We shall all be suffocated”</p><p> “Is it a fire?”</p><p> “No! No! It cannot be a fire.”</p><p> “The air is full of steam. The stones and the</p><p>window-panes are streaming with moisture.” </p><p> “Great Heavens, how stifling it is!”</p><p>Then, into thousands of minds at once leaped the </p><p>thought of the floodl </p><p>The memory of Cosmo Versal's reiterated warn- </p><p>ings came back with overwhelming force. It must </p><p>be the third sign that he had foretold. It had come! </p><p> Those fateful words—“the flood” and “Cosmo</p><p>Versal”—ran from lip to lip, and the hearts of those </p><p>who spoke, and those who heard, sank like lead in </p><p>their bosoms. </p><p> He would be a bold man, more confident in his</p><p>powers of description .than the present writer, who </p><p>should attempt to picture the scenes in New York </p><p>on that fearful night. </p><p> The gasping and terror-stricken millions waited</p><p>and longed for the hour of sunrise, hoping that </p><p>then the Stygian darkness would be dissipated, so </p><p>that people might, at least, see where to go and </p><p>what to do. Many, oppressed by the almost un- </p><p>breathable air, gave up in despair, and no longer </p><p>even hoped for morning to come. </p><p> In the midst of it all a collision occurred directly</p><p>over Central Park between two air-expresses, one </p><p>coming from Boston and the other from Albany. </p><p>(The use of small airplanes within the city limits </p><p>had, for sometime, been prohibited on account of </p><p>the constant danger of collisions, but the long- </p><p>distance lines were permitted to enter the metro- </p><p>politan district, making their landings and depar- </p><p>tures on specially constructed towers.) These two, </p><p>crowded with passengers, had, as it afterward ap- </p><p>peared, completely lost their bearings—the strong- </p><p>est electric lights being invisible a few hundred </p><p>feet away, while the wireless signals were confusing </p><p>—and, before the danger was apprehended, they </p><p>crashed together. </p><p> The collision occurred at a height of a thousand</p><p>feet, on the Fifth Avenue side of the park. Both </p><p>of the air-ships had their air foils smashed and </p><p>their decks crumpled up, and the unfortunate crews </p><p>and passengers were hurled through the im- </p><p>penetrable darkness to the ground. </p><p> Only four or five, who were lucky enough to be</p><p>entangled with the lighter parts of the wreckage,</p><p>escaped with their lives. But they were too much </p><p>injured to get upon their feet, and there they lay, </p><p>their sufferings made tenfold worse by the stifling </p><p>air, and the horror of their inexplicable situation, </p><p>until they were found and humanely relieved, more </p><p>than ten hours after their fall. </p><p> The noise of the collision had been heard in</p><p>Fifth Avenue, and its meaning was understood, but </p><p>amid the universal terror no one thought of trying </p><p>to aid the victims. Everybody was absorbed in </p><p>wondering what would become of himself. </p><p> When the long attended, hour of sunrise approach-</p><p>ed, the watchers were appalled by the absence of </p><p>even the slightest indication of the reappearance </p><p>of the orb of day. There was no lightening of the </p><p>dense cloak of darkness, and the great city seemed </p><p>dead. </p><p> For the first time in its history it failed to awake</p><p>after its regular period of repose, and to send </p><p>forth its myriad voices. It could not be seen; it </p><p>could not be heard; it made no sign. As far as any </p><p>outward indication of its existence was concerned </p><p>the mighty capital had ceased to be. </p><p> It was this frightful silence of the streets, and</p><p>of all the outer world, that terrified the people, </p><p>cooped up in their houses and in their rooms, by the </p><p>walls of darkness, more than almost any other </p><p>circumstance. It gave such an overwhelming sense </p><p>of the universality of the disaster, whatever that </p><p>disaster might be. Except where the voices of </p><p>neighbors could be heard, one could not be sure </p><p>that the whole population, outside his own family, </p><p>had not perished. </p><p> As the hours passed, and yet no light appeared,</p><p>another intimidating circumstance manifested itself. </p><p>From the start everybody had noticed the excessive </p><p>humidity of the dense air. Every solid object that </p><p>the hands came in contact with in the darkness was </p><p>wet, as if a thick fog had condensed upon it. This </p><p>supersaturation of the air (a principal cause of the </p><p>difficulty experienced in breathing) led to a result </p><p>which would quickly have been foreseen if people </p><p>could have had the use of their eyes, but which, </p><p>coming on invisibly, produced a- panic fear when at </p><p>690 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>last its presence was strikingly forced upon the </p><p>attention. </p><p> The moisture collected on all exposed surfaces</p><p>—on the roofs, the walls, the pavements—until </p><p>its quantity became sufficient to form little rills, </p><p>which sought the gutters, and there gathered force </p><p>and volume. Presently the streams became large </p><p>enough to create a noise of flowing water that at- </p><p>tracted the attention of the anxious watchers at the </p><p>open windows. Then cries of dismay arose. If </p><p>the water had been visible it would not have been </p><p>terrible. </p><p> But, to the overstrained imagination, the bub-</p><p>bling and splashing sound that came out of the </p><p>darkness was magnified into the rush of a torrent. </p><p>It seemed to grow louder every moment. What </p><p>was but a murmur on the ear-drum became a roar </p><p>in the excited brain-cells. </p><p> Once more were heard the ominous word, “The</p><p>flood!” </p><p> Panic spread from room to room, and from</p><p>house to house. The wild scenes that had attended </p><p>the first awakening were tame in comparison with </p><p>what now occurred. Self-control, reason—every- </p><p>thing—gave way to panic. </p><p> If they could have seen what they were about!</p><p> But then they would not have been about it. Then</p><p>their reason would not have been dethroned. </p><p> Darkness is the microscope of the imagination,</p><p>and it magnifies a million times! </p><p> Some timorously descended their doorsteps, and</p><p>feeling a current of water in the gutter, recoiled </p><p>with cries of horror, as if they had slipped down the </p><p>bank of a flooded river. As they retreated they </p><p>believed that the water was rising at their heels. </p><p> Others made their way to the roofs, persuaded</p><p>that the flood was already inundating the basements </p><p>and the lower stories of their dwellings. </p><p> Women wrung their hands and wept, and children</p><p>cried, and men pushed and stumbled about, and </p><p>shouted, and would have done something if only </p><p>they could have seen what to do. That was the </p><p>pity of it! It was as if the world had been stricken </p><p>blind, and then the trump of an archangel had </p><p>sounded, crying:</p><p> “Fly! Fly! for the Avenger is on your heels!”</p><p> How could they fly?</p><p> This awful strain could not have lasted. It would</p><p>have needed no deluge to finish New York if that </p><p>maddening pall of darkness had remained un- </p><p>broken a few hours longer. But, just when thou- </p><p>sands had given up in despair, there came a rapid </p><p>change. </p><p> At the hour of noon light suddenly broke over-</p><p>head. Beginning in a round patch enclosed in an </p><p>iridescent halo, it spread swiftly, seeming to melt </p><p>its way down through the thick, dark mass that </p><p>choked the air, and in less than fifteen minutes New </p><p>York and all its surroundings emerged into the </p><p>golden light of noonday. </p><p> People who had expected at any moment to feel</p><p>the water pitilessly rising about them looked out </p><p>of their windows, and were astonished to see only </p><p>tiny rivulets which were already shriveling out of </p><p>sight in the gutters. In a few minutes there was </p><p>no running water left, although the dampness on </p><p>the walls and walks showed how great the humidity </p><p>of the air had been. </p><p> At the same time the oppression was lifted from</p><p>the respiratory apparatus, and everybody breathed </p><p>freely once more, and felt courage returning with </p><p>each respiration. </p><p> The whole great city Seemed to utter a vast sigh</p><p>of relief. </p><p> And then its voice was heard, as it had never</p><p>been heard before, rising higher and louder every </p><p>moment. It was the first time that morning had </p><p>ever broken at midday. </p><p> The streets became filled, with magical quickness,</p><p>by hundreds of thousands, who chattered, and </p><p>shouted, and laughed, and shook hands, and asked </p><p>questions, and told their experiences, and demanded </p><p>if anybody had ever heard of such a thing before, </p><p>and wondered what it could have been, and what it </p><p>meant, and whether it would come back again. </p><p> Telephones of all kinds were kept constantly</p><p>busy. Women called up their friends, and talked </p><p>hysterically; men called up their associates and </p><p>partners, and tried to talk business. </p><p> There was a rush for the Elevated, for the Sub-</p><p>ways, for the street auto-cars. The great arteries</p><p>of traffic became jammed, and the noise rose louder </p><p>and louder. </p><p> Belated aero-expresses arrived at the towers</p><p>from East and West, and their passengers hurried </p><p>down to join the excited multitudes below. </p><p> In an incredibly brief time the newsboys were</p><p>out with extras. Then everybody read with the </p><p>utmost avidity what everybody knew already. </p><p> But before many hours passed there was real</p><p>news, come by radio, and by submarine telephone </p><p>and telegraph, telling how the whole world had </p><p>been swept by the marvelous cloak of darkness. </p><p> In Europe it had arrived ^uring the morning</p><p>hours; in Asia during the afternoon. </p><p> The phenomenon had varied in different places.</p><p>In some the darkness had not been complete, but </p><p>everywhere it was accompanied by extraordinary </p><p>humidity, and occasionally by brief but torrential </p><p>rains. The terror had been universal, and all be- </p><p>lieved that it was the Third Sign predicted by </p><p>Cosmo Versal. </p><p> Of course, the latter was interviewed, and he</p><p>gave out a characteristic manifesto. </p><p> “One of the outlying spirals of the nebula has</p><p>struck the earth,” he said. But do not be de- </p><p>ceived. It is nothing in comparison with what is </p><p>coming. And it is the last warning that will be </p><p>given! You have obstinately shut your eyes to the </p><p>truth, and you have throion away your lives!” </p><p> This, together with the recent awful experience,</p><p>produced a great effect. Those who had begun to </p><p>lay foundations for arks thought of resuming the </p><p>work. Those who had before sought places with </p><p>Cosmo called him up by telephone. But only </p><p>the voice of Joseph Smith answered, and his words </p><p>were not reassuring. </p><p> “Mr. Versal,” he said,' “directs me to say that</p><p>at present he will allot no places. He is consider- </p><p>ing whom he will take.” . </p><p> The recipients of this reply looked very blank.</p><p>But at last one of them, a well-known broker in </p><p>.Wall Street, was more angered than frightened: </p><p>flPHE SECOND DELUGE </p><p>J^'Eet'hi m'gcffo tho deuce!” he growled; “him and </p><p>his flood together!” </p><p> Then he resolutely set out to bull the market.</p><p> It seems incredible—but such is human nature—</p><p>that a few days of bright sunshine should once </p><p>more have driven off the clouds of fear that had </p><p>settled so densely over the popular mind. Of course, </p><p>not everybody forgot the terrors of the Third Sign </p><p>—they had struck too deep, but gradually the strain </p><p>was relaxed, and people in general accepted the re- </p><p>newed assurances of the savants of the Pludder </p><p>type that nothing that had occurred was inexplicable </p><p>by the ordinary laws of nature. The great dark- </p><p>ness, they averred, differed from previous occur- </p><p>rences of the kind only in degree, and it was to be </p><p>ascribed to nothing more serious than atmospheric </p><p>vagaries', such as that which produced the historic </p><p>Dark Day in New England in 1780. </p><p>' But more nervous persons noticed, with certain </p><p>misgivings, that Cosmo Vers&amp;l pushed on his opera- </p><p>tions, if possible, more energetically than before. </p><p>And there was a stir of renewed interest when the </p><p>announcement came out one day that the ark was </p><p>finished. Then thousands hurried to Mineola to </p><p>look upon the completed work. </p><p> The extraordinary massiveness of the ark was</p><p>imposing. Towering ominously on its platform, </p><p>which was so arranged that when the waters came </p><p>they should lift the structure from its cradle and </p><p>set it afloat without any other launching, it seemed </p><p>in itself a prophecy of impending disaster. </p><p> Overhead it was roofed with an oblong dome of</p><p>levium, through which rose four great metallic </p><p>chimneys, placed above the mighty engines. The </p><p>roof sloped down to the vertical sides, to afford </p><p>protection from in-bursting waves. Rows of port- </p><p>holes, closed with thick glass, indicated the location </p><p>of the superposed decks; On each side four gang- </p><p>ways gave access to the interior, and long, sloping </p><p>approaches offered means of entry from the ground. </p><p> Cosmo had a force of trained guards on hand,</p><p>but everybody who wished was permitted to enter </p><p>and inspect the ark. Curious multitudes constantly </p><p>mounted and descended the long approaches, being </p><p>kept moving by the guards. </p><p> Inside they wandered about astonished at what</p><p>they saw. </p><p> The three lower decks were devoted to the storage</p><p>of food and of fuel for the electric generators, all</p><p>of which Cosmo Vers&amp;l had been accumulating for </p><p>months. </p><p> Above these were two decks, which the visitors</p><p>were informed would be occupied by animals, and </p><p>by boxes of seeds, and prepared roots of plants, with </p><p>which it was intended to restore the vegetable life </p><p>of the planet after the water should have sufficiently </p><p>receded. </p><p> The five remaining decks were for human beings.</p><p>There were roomy quarters for the commander and </p><p>his officers, others for the crew, several large </p><p>saloons, and five hundred sets of apartments of vari- </p><p>ous sizes to be occupied by the passengers whom </p><p>Cosmo should choose to accompany him. They </p><p>had all the convenience of the most luxurious state- </p><p>rooms of the transoceanic liners. Many joking re- </p><p>marks were exchanged by the visitors as they in- </p><p>pected these rooms. </p><p> Cosmo ran about among his guests, explaining</p><p>everything, showing great pride in his work, point- </p><p>ing out a thousand particulars in which his fore- </p><p>sight had been displayed—but, to everybody’s </p><p>astonishment, he uttered no more warnings, and </p><p>made no appeals. On the contrary, as some ob- </p><p>servant persons noticed, he seemed to avoid any </p><p>reference to the fate of those who should not be </p><p>included in his ship’s company. </p><p> Some sensitive souls were disturbed by detecting</p><p>in his eyes a look that seemed to express deep pity </p><p>and regret. Occasionally he would draw apart, and </p><p>gaze at the passing crowds with a compassionate </p><p>expression, and then, slowly turning his back, while </p><p>his fingers worked nervously, would disappear, with </p><p>downcast head, into his private room. </p><p> The comparatively few who particularly noticed</p><p>this conduct of Cosmo’s were deeply moved—more </p><p>than they had been by all the enigmatic events of </p><p>the past months. One man, Amos Blank, a rich </p><p>manufacturer, who was notorious for the merciless </p><p>methods that he had pursued in eliminating his </p><p>weaker competitors, was so much disturbed by </p><p>Cosmo Vers&amp;Fs change of manner that he sought an </p><p>opportunity to speak to him privately. Cosmo re- </p><p>ceived him with a reluctance that he could not but </p><p>notice, and which, somehow, increased his anxiety. </p><p> “—I—thought,” said the billionaire hesitatingly,</p><p>“that I ought—that is to say, that I might, perhaps, </p><p>inquire—might inform myself—under what condi- </p><p>tions one could, supposing the necessity to arise, </p><p>obtain a passage in your—in your ark. Of course </p><p>the question of cost does not enter in the matter— </p><p>not with me"</p><p> Cosmo gazed at the man coldly, and all the com-</p><p>passion that had recently softened his steely eyes </p><p>disappeared. For a moment he did not speak. Then </p><p>he said, measuring his words and speaking with an </p><p>emphasis that chilled the heart of his listener: </p><p> “Mr. Blank, the necessity has arisen”</p><p> “So you say—so you say—” began Mr. Blank.</p><p> “So I say,” interrupted Cosmo sternly, “and I</p><p>say further that this ark has been constructed to </p><p>save those who are worthy of salvation, in order </p><p>that all that is good and admirable in humanity may </p><p>not perish from the earth.” </p><p> “Exactly, exactly,” responded the other smiling,</p><p>and rubbing his hands. “You are quite right to </p><p>make a proper choice. If your flood is going to </p><p>cause a general destruction of mankind of course </p><p>you are bound to select the best, the most advanced, </p><p>those who have pushed to the front, those who have </p><p>means, those with the strongest resources. The </p><p>masses, who possess none of these qualifications and </p><p>claim—” </p><p> Again Cosmo Vers&amp;l interrupted him, more coldly</p><p>than before: </p><p> “It costs nothing to be a passenger in this ark.</p><p>Ten million dollars, a hundred millions, would not </p><p>purchase a place in it! Did you ever hear the </p><p>parable of the camel and the needle’s eye? The </p><p>price of a ticket here is an irreproachable record!" </p><p> With these astonishing words Cosmo turned his</p><p>back upon his visitor and shut the door in his face. </p><p> The billionaire staggered back, rubbed his head,</p><p>and then went off muttering: </p><p> “An idiot! A plain idiot! There will be no flood!”</p><p>692 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>CHAPTER VI </p><p>Selecting the Flower of Mankind </p><p>AFTER a day or two, during which the ark </p><p>was left open for inspection, and was .visited </p><p>by many thousands, Cosmo Versal announced </p><p>that no more visitors would be admitted. He placed </p><p>sentinels at all entrances, and began the construc- </p><p>tion of a shallow ditch, entirely enclosing the </p><p>grounds. Public curiosity was intensely excited by </p><p>this singular proceeding, especially when it became </p><p>known that the workmen were stringing copper </p><p>wires the w'hole length of the ditch. </p><p> “What the deuce is he up to now?” was the ques-</p><p>tion on everybody’s lips. </p><p> But Cosmo and his employees gave evasive replies</p><p>to all inquiries. A great change had come about in </p><p>Como’s treatment of the public. No one was any </p><p>longer encouraged to watch the operations. </p><p> When the wires were all placed and the ditch was</p><p>finished, it was covered up so that it made a broad </p><p>flat-topped dyke encircling the field. </p><p> Speculation was rife for several days concerning</p><p>the purpose of the mysterious ditch and its wires, </p><p>but no universally satisfactory explanation was </p><p>found. </p><p> One enterprising reporter worked out an elab-</p><p>orate scheme, which he ascribed to Cosmo Vers&amp;l, </p><p>according to which the wired ditch was to serve as </p><p>a cumulator of electricity, which would, at the pro- </p><p>per moment, launch the ark upon the waters, thus </p><p>avoiding all danger of a fatal detention in case </p><p>the flood should rise too rapidly. </p><p> This seemed so absurd on its face that it went far</p><p>to quiet apprehension by reawakening doubts of </p><p>Cosmo’s sanity—the more especially since he made </p><p>no attempt to contradict the assertion that the </p><p>scheme was his. </p><p> Nobody guessed what his real intention was; if</p><p>people had guessed, it might have been bad for their </p><p>peace of mind. </p><p> The next move of Cosmo Versal was taken with-</p><p>out any knowledge or suspicion on the part of the </p><p>public. He had now established himself in his apart- </p><p>ments in the ark, and was never seen in the city. </p><p> One evening, when all was quiet about the ark,</p><p>night work being now unnecessary, Cosmo and </p><p>Joseph Smith sat facing one another at a square </p><p>table lighted by a shaded lamp. Smith had a pile </p><p>of writing paper before him, and was evidently pre- </p><p>pared to take notes. </p><p> Cosmo’s great brow was contracted with thought,</p><p>and he leaned his cheek upon his hand. It was clear </p><p>that his meditations were troublesome. For at </p><p>least ten minutes he did not open his lips, and Smith </p><p>watched him anxiously. At last he said, speaking </p><p>slowly: </p><p> “Joseph, this is the most trying problem that I</p><p>have had to solve. The success of all my work de- </p><p>pends upon my not making a mistake now. </p><p> “The burden of responsibility that rests on ray</p><p>shoulders is such as no mortal has ever borne. It </p><p>is too great for human capacity—and yet how can I </p><p>cast it off? </p><p> “I am to decide who shall be saved! I, I alone, I</p><p>Cosmo Versal, hold in my hands the fate of a race </p><p>numbering two thousand million souls the fate </p><p>of a planet which, without my intervention, would </p><p>become simply a vast tomb. It is for vie to say </p><p>whether the genus homo shall be perpetuated, and </p><p>in what form it shall bo perpetuated. Joseph, this </p><p>is terrible! These are the functions of deity, not of </p><p>man.” </p><p> Joseph Smith seemed no longer to breathe, so</p><p>intense was his attention. His eyes glowed under </p><p>the dark brows, and his pencil trembled in his fin- </p><p>gers. After a slight pause Cosmo Versal went on: </p><p>“If I felt any doubt that Providence has fore- </p><p>ordained me to do this work, and given me extra- </p><p>ordinary facilities, and extraordinary knowledge, </p><p>to enable me to perform it, I would, this instant, </p><p>blow out my brains.” </p><p>Again he was silent, the secretary, after fidgeting </p><p>about, bending and unbending his brows, and tap- </p><p>ping nervously upon the table, at last said, solemnly: </p><p>“Cosmo, you are ordained; you must do the </p><p>work.” </p><p> “I must,” returned Cosmo Versal, ‘I know that;</p><p>and yet the sense of my responsibility sometimes </p><p>covers me with a cloud of despair. The other day, </p><p>when the ark was crowded with curiosity seekers, </p><p>the thought that not one of all those tens of thous- </p><p>ands could escape, and that hundreds of millions of </p><p>others must also be lost, overwhelmed me. Then I </p><p>began to reproach myself for not having been a </p><p>more effective agent in warning my fellows of</p><p>their peril. Joseph, I have miserably failed. I </p><p>ought to have produced universal conviction, and I </p><p>have not done it.” </p><p> “It is not your fault, Cosmo,” said Joseph Smith,</p><p>reaching out his long arm to touch his leader’s </p><p>hand. “It is an unbelieving generation. They have </p><p>rejected even the signs in the heavens. Tho voice </p><p>of an archangel would not have convinced them.” </p><p>“It is true,” replied Cosmo. “And the truth is </p><p>the more bitter to me because I spoke in the name </p><p>of science, and the very men who represent science </p><p>have been my most determined opponents, blinding </p><p>the people’s eyes—after wilfully shutting their </p><p>own.” </p><p> “You say you have been weak,” interposed Smith,</p><p>“which you have not been; but you would be weak </p><p>if you now shrank from your plain duty.” </p><p> “True!” cried Cosmo, in a changed voice. “Let</p><p>us then proceed. I had a lesson the other day. </p><p>Amos Blank came to me, puffed with his pillaged </p><p>millions. I saw then what I had to do. I told him </p><p>plainly that he was not among the chosen. Hand </p><p>me that book.” </p><p> The secretary pushed a large volume within</p><p>Cosmo’s reach. He opened it. It was a ‘Tear- </p><p>Book of Science, Politics, Sociology, History, and </p><p>Government.” </p><p> Cosmo ran over its pages, stopping to read a few</p><p>lines here and there, seeming to make mental notes. </p><p>After a while he pushed the book aside, looked at </p><p>his companion thoughtfully, and began: </p><p> “The trouble with the world is that morally and</p><p>physically it has for thousands of years grown more </p><p>and more corrupt. The flower of civilization, about </p><p>which people boast so much, nods over the stagnant </p><p>waters of a moral swamp and draws its perilous </p><p>beauty from the poisons of the miasma. </p><p> “The nebula, in drowning the earth, brings op-</p><p>THE SECOND DELUGE </p><p>693 </p><p>portunity for a new birth of mankind. You will </p><p>remember, Joseph, that the same conditions are said </p><p>to have prevailed in the time of Noah. There was </p><p>no science then, and we do not know exactly on what </p><p>principles the choice was made of those who should </p><p>escape; but the simple history of Noah shows that </p><p>he and his friends represented the best manhood of </p><p>that age. </p><p> “But the seeds of corruption were not eliminated,</p><p>and the same problem recurs today. </p><p> “I have to determine whom I will save. I attack</p><p>the question by inquiring who represent the best </p><p>elements of humanity? Let us first consider men </p><p>by classes.” </p><p> “And why not by races?” asked Smith.</p><p> “I shall not look to see whether a man is black,</p><p>white or yellow; whether his skull is brachycephalic </p><p>or dolichocephalic,” replied Cosmo. “I shall look </p><p>inside. No race has ever shown itself permanently </p><p>the best.” </p><p> “Then by classes you mean occupations?”</p><p> "Well, yes, for the occupation shows the tendency,</p><p>the quintessence of character. Some men are born </p><p>rulers and leaders; others are born followers. Both </p><p>are necessary, and I must have both kinds.” </p><p> “You will begin perhaps with'the kings, the presi-</p><p>dents ?” </p><p> “Not at all. I shall begin with men of science.</p><p>They are the true leaders.” </p><p> “But they have betrayed you—they have shut</p><p>their eyes and blindfolded others,” objected Joseph </p><p>Smith. </p><p> “You do not understand me,” said Cosmo, with a</p><p>commiserating smile. “If my scientific brethren </p><p>have not seen as clearly as I have, the fault lies not </p><p>in science, but in lack of comprehension. Never- </p><p>theless, they are on the right track; they have the </p><p>gist of the matter in them; they are trained in the </p><p>right method. If I should leave them out, the re- </p><p>generated world would start-a thousand years be- </p><p>hind time. Besides, many of them are not so blind; </p><p>some of them have got a glimpse of the truth.” </p><p> “Not such men as Pludder,” said Smith.</p><p> “All the same, I am going to save Pludder,” said</p><p>Cosmo Versal. </p><p> Joseph Smith fairly jumped with astonishment.</p><p>"You—are—going—to—save—Pludder,” he fal- </p><p>tered. “But he is the worst of all.” </p><p> "Not from my present view-point. Pludder has</p><p>a good brain; he can handle the tools; he is intel- </p><p>lectually honest; he has done great things for sci- </p><p>ence in the past. And, besides, I do not conceal from </p><p>you the fact that I should like to see him convicted </p><p>out of his own mouth.” </p><p> “But,” persisted Smith, “I have heard you say</p><p>that he was—” </p><p> “No matter what you have heard me say,” inter-</p><p>rupted Cosmo impatiently. “I say now that he shall </p><p>go with us. Put down his name at the head of the </p><p>list” </p><p> Dumfounded and muttering under his breath,</p><p>Smith obeyed. </p><p> “I can take exactly one thousand individuals, ex-</p><p>clusive of the crew,” continued Versal, paying no </p><p>attention to his confidant’s repeated shaking of his </p><p>head. “Good Heavens, think of that! One thou- </p><p>Band put of two thousand millions! But so be it. </p><p>Nobody would listen to me, and now it is too late.- </p><p>I must fix the number for each class.” </p><p> “There is one thing—one curious question—that</p><p>occurs to me,” put in Smith hesitatingly. “What </p><p>about families?” </p><p> “There you’ve hit it,” cried Cosmo. “That’s ex-</p><p>actly what bothers me. There must be as many </p><p>women as men—that goes without saying. Then, </p><p>too, the strongest moral element is in the women, </p><p>although they don’t weigh heavily for science. But </p><p>the aged people and the children—there’s the dif- </p><p>ficulty. If I invite a man who possesses unquestion- </p><p>able qualifications, but has a large family, what am </p><p>I	to do? I can’t crowd out others as desirable as he</p><p>for the sake of carrying all of his stripes. The </p><p>principles of eugenics demand a wide field of selec- </p><p>tion.” </p><p> Cosmo Versal covered his eyes, rested his big</p><p>head on his hands, and his elbows on the table. </p><p>Presently he looked up with an air of decision. </p><p> “I see what I must do,” he said. “I can take only</p><p>four persons belonging to any one family. Two of</p><p>them may be children—a man, his wife, and two </p><p>children—no more.” </p><p> “But that will be very hard lines for them-=” be-</p><p>gan Joseph Smith. </p><p> “Hard lines!” Cosmo broke in. “Do you think it</p><p>is easy lines for me? Good Heavens, man! I am </p><p>forced to this decision. It rends my heart to think </p><p>of it, but I can’t avoid the responsibility.” </p><p> Smith dropped his eyes, and Cosmo resumed his</p><p>reflections. In a little while he .spoke again: </p><p>“Another thing that I must fix is an age limit. </p><p>But that will have to be subject to certain excep- </p><p>tions. Very aged persons in general will not do— </p><p>they could not survive the long voyage, and only in </p><p>the rare instances where their experience of life </p><p>might be valuable would they serve any good pur- </p><p>pose in reestablishing the race. Children are in- </p><p>dispensable—but they must not be too young—-in- </p><p>fants in arms would not do at all. Oh, this is sorry </p><p>work! But I must harden ihy heart.” </p><p> Joseph Smith looked at his chief, and felt a</p><p>twinge of sympathy, tempered by admiration, for </p><p>he saw clearly the terrible contest in his friend’s </p><p>mind and appreciated the heroic nature of the de- </p><p>cision to which the inexorable logic of facts had </p><p>driven it. </p><p> Cosmo Versal was again silent for a long time.</p><p>Finally he appeared to throw off the incubus, and, </p><p>with a return of his ordinary decisiveness, ex- </p><p>claimed : </p><p> “Enough. I have settled the general principle.</p><p>Now to the choice.” </p><p> Then, closing his eyes, as if to assist his memory,</p><p>he ran over a list of names well known in the world </p><p>of science, and Smith set them down in a long row </p><p>under the name of “Abiel Pludder,” with which he </p><p>had begun. </p><p> At last Cosmo Vers&amp;l ceased his dictation.</p><p>“There,” he said, “that is the end of that cate- </p><p>gory. I may add to or subtract from it later. Ac- </p><p>cording to probability, making allowance for bach- </p><p>elors, each name will represent three persons; there </p><p>are seventy-five names, which means two hundred </p><p>and twenty-five places reserved for science. I will </p><p>694 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> now make a series of other categories and assign the</p><p> number of places for each.”</p><p> He seized a sheet of paper and fell to work, while</p><p> Smith looked on, drumming with his fingers and</p><p> contorting his huge black eyebrows. For half an</p><p> hour complete silence reigned, broken only by the</p><p> scratching of Cosmo VersaPs pencil. At the end of</p><p> that time he threw down the pencil and held out the</p><p> paper to his companion.</p><p> "Of course,” he said, “this is not a complete list</p><p> of human occupations. I have set down the prin-</p><p> cipal ones as they occurred to me. There will be</p><p> time to correct any oversight. Read it.”</p><p> Smith, by force of habit, read it aloud:</p><p> No. of Probable No.</p><p> Names. of Places.</p><p>75 ...... 225 </p><p>15 ...... 45 </p><p>10 ...... 30 </p><p>10 ...... 30 </p><p>5	...... 15</p><p>15 ...... 45 </p><p>20 ...... 60 </p><p>20 ...... 60 </p><p>30 ...... 90 </p><p>1	...... 3</p><p>6	...... 18</p><p>2	...... 6</p><p>14 k...... 42 </p><p>1 ............3 </p><p>12 ............36 </p><p>3 ............9 </p><p>0	............0</p><p>90 ............270 </p><p>Totals ...................... 329 ...... 987 </p><p>Special reservations ........................... 13 </p><p>Grand total, places .........................1,000 </p><p> Several times while Joseph Smith was reading</p><p> he raised his eyebrows, as if in surprise or mental</p><p> protest, but made no remark.</p><p> “Now,” resumed Cosmo when the secretary had</p><p> finished, “let us begin with the rulers. I do not</p><p> know them as intimately as I know the men of</p><p> science, but I am sure I have given them places</p><p> enough. Suppose you take this book and call them</p><p> over to me.”</p><p> Smith opened the “year-book,” and began:</p><p> “George Washington Samson, President of the</p><p> United States.”</p><p> “He goes. He is not intellectually brilliant, but</p><p> he has strong sense and good moral fiber. I’ll save</p><p> him if for no other reason than his veto of the Ant-</p><p> arctic Continent grab bill.”</p><p> “Shcn Su, Son of Heaven, Emperor of China.”</p><p> “Put him down. I like him. He is. a true Con-</p><p> fucian.”</p><p> Joseph Smith read off several other names at</p><p> which Cosmo shook his head. Then he came to:</p><p> “Richard Edward, by the grace of God, King of</p><p> Great—”</p><p> “Enough,” broke in Cosmo; “we all know him—</p><p> the man who has done more for peace by putting</p><p> half the British navy out of commission than any</p><p> other ruler in history. I can’t leave him out.”</p><p> “Achille Dumont, President of the French repub-</p><p> lic.</p><p> “Will you take him?”</p><p> “Admitted, for he has at last done his part td feet</p><p> the war microbe out of the human system,”</p><p> Then followed a number of rulers who were not</p><p>lucky enough to meet with Cosmo Versal’s approval. </p><p> The selection was continued until fifteen names</p><p>had been obtained, including that of the new, dark- </p><p>skinned President of Liberia, and Cosmo declared </p><p>that he would not add another one. </p><p> Then came the ten statesmen who were chosen</p><p>with utter disregard to racial and national lines. </p><p> In selecting his ten business magnates, Cosmo</p><p>stated his rule: </p><p> “I exclude no man simply because he is a billion-</p><p>aire. I consider the way he made his money. The </p><p>world must always have rich men. How could I </p><p>have built the ark if I had been poor ?” </p><p>“Philanthropists,” read Smith. </p><p> “I should have taken a hundred if I could have</p><p>found them,” said Cosmo. “There are plenty of </p><p>candidates, but these five—naming them—are the </p><p>only genuine ones, and I am doubtful about several </p><p>of them. But I must run some chances, philan- </p><p>thropy being indispensable.” </p><p> For the fifteen representatives of art Cosmo con-</p><p>fined his selection largely to architecture. </p><p> “The building instinct must be preserved,” he</p><p>explained. “One of the first things we shall need </p><p>after the flood recedes is a variety of all kinds of </p><p>structures. But it's a pretty bad lot at the best. I </p><p>shall try to reform their ideas during the voyage. </p><p>As to the other artists, they, too, will need some </p><p>hints that I can give them, and that they can trans- </p><p>mit to their children.” </p><p> Under the head of religious teachers, Cosmo re-</p><p>marked that he had tried to be fair to all forms of </p><p>genuine faith that had a large following. The </p><p>school-teachers represented the principal languages, </p><p>and Cosmo selected the names from a volume on </p><p>“The Educational Systems of the World,” remark- </p><p>ing that he ran some risk here, but it could not be </p><p>avoided. </p><p> “Doctors—they get a rather liberal allowance,</p><p>don’t they?” asked Smith. </p><p> “Not half as large as I’d like to have it,” was the</p><p>response. “The doctors are the salt of the earth. </p><p>It breaks my heart to have to leave out so many </p><p>whose worth I know.” </p><p> “And only one lawyer!” pursued Joseph. That’s</p><p>curious.” </p><p> “Not in the least curious. Do you think I want</p><p>to scatter broadcast the seeds of litigation in a re- </p><p>generated world? Put down the name of Chief Jus- </p><p>tice Good of the United States Supreme Court. He’ll </p><p>see that equity prevails.” </p><p> “And only six writers,” continued Smith.</p><p> “And that’s probably too many,” said Cosmo.</p><p>“Set down under that head Peter Inkson, whom I </p><p>will engage to record the last scenes on the drown- </p><p>ing earth; James Henry Blackwitt, who will tell tho </p><p>story of the voyage; Jules Bourgeois, who can de- </p><p>scribe the personnel of the passengers; Sergius </p><p>Narishkoff, who will make a study of their psy- </p><p>chology; and Nicolao Ludolfo, whose description of </p><p>the ark will be an invaluable historic document a </p><p>thousand years hence.” </p><p> “But you have included n,o poets,” remarked</p><p>•Smith. </p><p> “Not necessary,” responded Cosmo. “Every hu-</p><p>jrnan being is a poet at bottom,” </p><p> Occupation.</p><p>Science (already assigned) </p><p>Rulers ................. </p><p>Statesmen .............. </p><p>Business magnates ...... </p><p>Philanthropists .......... </p><p>Artists ................. </p><p>Religious teachers ....... </p><p>School-teachers ......... </p><p>Doctors ................ </p><p>Lawyers ................ </p><p>Writers ................ </p><p>Editors ................. </p><p>Players ................. </p><p>Philosophers ............. </p><p>Musicians .............. </p><p>Speculative geniuses ..... </p><p>“Society” ............... </p><p>Agriculture and mechanics </p><p>THE SECOND DELUGE </p><p>695 </p><p> “And no novelists,” persisted the secretary.</p><p>“They will spring up thicker than weeds before </p><p>the waters are half gone—at least, they would if I </p><p>let one aboard the ark.” </p><p> “Editors—two?”</p><p> “That’s right. And two too many perhaps. I’ll</p><p>take Jinks of the Thunderer, and Bullock of the </p><p>Owl” </p><p> “But both of them have persistently called you</p><p>an idiot.” </p><p> “For that reason I want them. No world could</p><p>get along without some real idiots.” </p><p> “I am rather surprised at the next entry, if you</p><p>will permit me to speak of it,” said Joseph Smith. </p><p>“Here are forty-two places reserved for players.” </p><p>“That means twenty-eight adults, and probably </p><p>some youngsters who will be able to take parts,” </p><p>returned Cosmo, rubbing his hands with a satis- </p><p>fied smile. “I have taken as many players as I </p><p>conscientiously could, not only because of their </p><p>future value, but because they will do more than </p><p>anything else to keep up the spirits of everybody </p><p>in the ark. I shall have a stage set in the largest </p><p>saloon.” </p><p> Joseph Smith scowled, but held his peace. Then</p><p>glancing again at the paper, he remarked that </p><p>there was but one philosopher to be provided for. </p><p> “It is easy to name him,” said Cosmo. “Kant</p><p>Jacobi Leergeschwatz.” </p><p> “Why he?”</p><p> “Because he will harmlessly represent the meta-</p><p>physical genus, for nobody will ever understand </p><p>him.” </p><p> “Musicians twelve?”</p><p> “Chosen for the same reason as the players,”</p><p>said Cosmo, rapidly writing down twelve names </p><p>because they were not ea,sy to pronounce, and </p><p>handing them to Smith, who duly copied them off. </p><p> When this was done Cosmo himself called out</p><p>the next category—“ ‘speculative geniuses.’ ” </p><p> “I mean by that,” he continued, “not Wall Street</p><p>speculators, but foreseeing men who possess the</p><p>gift of comprehending the ‘seeds of time,’ but who </p><p>never get a hearing in their own day, and are hardly </p><p>ever remembered by future ages which enjoy the </p><p>fruits whose buds they recognized.” </p><p> Cosmo mentioned two names which Joseph</p><p>Smith had never heard, and told him they ought </p><p>to be written in golden ink. </p><p> “They are sui generis, and alone in the world.</p><p>They are the most precious cargo I shall have </p><p>aboard,” he added. </p><p> Smith shrugged his shoulders and stared blank-</p><p>ly at the paper, while Cosmo sank into a reverie. </p><p>Finally the secretary said, smiling with evident </p><p>approval this time: </p><p> “ ‘Society’ zero.”</p><p> “Precisely, for what does ‘society’ represent ex-</p><p>cept its own vanity?” </p><p> “And then comes agriculture and mechanics.”</p><p>For this category Cosmo seemed to be quite as </p><p>well prepared as for that of science. He took from </p><p>his pocket a list already made out and handed it to </p><p>Joseph Smith. It contained forty names marked </p><p>“cultivators, farmers, gardeners,” and fifty “me- </p><p>chanics.”	I</p><p>“At the beginning of the twentieth century,” he&gt; </p><p>said, “I should have had to reverse that propor- </p><p>tion—in fact, my entire list would then have been </p><p>top-heavy, and I should have been forced to give </p><p>half of all the places to agriculture. But thanks to </p><p>our scientific farming, the personnel employed in </p><p>cultivation is now reduced to a minimum while </p><p>showing ihaximum results. I have already stored </p><p>the ark with seeds of the latest scientifically de- </p><p>veloped plants, and with all the needed implements </p><p>and machinery.” </p><p> “There yet remain thirteen places ‘specially re-</p><p>served,’ ” said Smith, referring to the paper. </p><p> “I shall fill those later,” responded Cosmo, and</p><p>then added with a thoughtful look, “I have some </p><p>humble friends. </p><p> “The next thing,” he continued, after a pause,</p><p>“is to prepare the letters of invitation. But we </p><p>have done enough for tonight. ' I will give you the </p><p>form to-morrow.” </p><p> And all this while half the world had been peace-</p><p>fully sleeping, and the other half going about its </p><p>business, more and more forgetful of recent events,</p><p>and if it had known what those two men were </p><p>about it would probably have exploded in a gust </p><p>of laughter. </p><p>CHAPTER VII </p><p>The Waters Begin to Rise </p><p>COSMO VERSAL had begun the construction </p><p>of his ark in the latter part of June. It </p><p>was now the end of November. The </p><p>terrors of the Third Sign had occurred in Septem- </p><p>ber. Since then the sky had nearly resumed its </p><p>normal color, there had been no storms, but the </p><p>heat of summer had not relaxed. People were puz- </p><p>zled by the absence of the usual indications of </p><p>autumn, although vegetation had shriveled on ac- </p><p>count of the persistent high temperature and con- </p><p>stant sunshine. </p><p> “An extraordinary year,” admitted the meteor-</p><p>ologists,” but there have been warm autumns be- </p><p>fore, and it is simply a question of degree. Nature </p><p>will restore the balance and in good time, and prob- </p><p>ably we shall have a severe winter.” </p><p> On the 30th of November, the brassy sky at</p><p>New York showed no signs of change, when the </p><p>following despatch, which most of the newspapers </p><p>triple-leaded and capped with stunning head-Iines, </p><p>quivered down from Churchill, Keewatin: </p><p> During last night the level of the water in</p><p> Hudson Bay rose fully nine feet. Consterna-</p><p> tion reigned this morning when ship-owners</p><p> found their wharves inundated, and vessels</p><p> straining at short cables. The ice-breaker</p><p> “Victoria” was lifted on the back of a sandy</p><p> bar, having apparently been driven by a heavy</p><p> wave, which must have come from the East.</p><p> There are other indications that the mysterious</p><p> rise began with a “bore” from the eastward.</p><p> It is thought that the vast mass of icebergs</p><p> set afloat on Davis’s Strait by the long con-</p><p> tinued hot weather melting the shore glaciers,</p><p> has caused a jam off the mouth of Hudson</p><p> Strait, and turned the Polar current suddenly,</p><p> into the bay. But this is only a theory.. A</p><p> further rise is anticipated,</p><p>696 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> Startling as was this news, it might not by itself,</p><p>have greatly disturbed the public mind if it had not </p><p>been followed, in a few hours, by intelligence of </p><p>immense floods in Alaska and in the basin of the </p><p>Mackenzie River. </p><p> And the next day an etherogram from Obdorsk</p><p>bordered on the grotesque, and filled many sen- </p><p>sitive readers with horror. </p><p> It was said that in the vast tundra regions of</p><p>Northern Siberia the frozen soil had dissolved into </p><p>a bottomless slough, from whose depths uprose </p><p>prehistoric mammoths, their long hair matted with </p><p>mud, and their curved tusks of ivory gleaming like </p><p>trumpets over the field of their resurrection. The </p><p>despatch concluded with a heart-rending account of </p><p>the loss of a large party of ivory hunters, who, hav- </p><p>ing ventured too far from the more solid land, sud- </p><p>denly found the ground turning to black ooze be- </p><p>neath their feet, and, despite their struggles, were </p><p>all engulfed within sight of their friends, who dared </p><p>not try to approach them. </p><p> Cosmo Versal, when interviewed, calmly remark-</p><p>ed that the flood was beginning in the north, be- </p><p>cause it was the northern part of the globe that </p><p>was nearest the heart of the nebula. The motion </p><p>of the earth being northward, that end of its axis </p><p>resembled the prow of a ship. </p><p> “But this,” he added, “is hot the true deluge.</p><p>The Arctic ice-cap is melting, and the frozen soil </p><p>is turning into a sponge in consequence of the heat </p><p>of friction developed in the air by the inrush* of </p><p>nebulous matter. The aqueous vapor, however, has </p><p>not yet touched the earth. It will begin to mani- </p><p>fest its presence within a few days, and then the </p><p>globe will drink water at every pore. The vapor </p><p>will finally condense into falling oceans.” </p><p> “What would you advise people to do?” asked one</p><p>of the reporters. </p><p> The reply was given in a perfectly even voice,</p><p>without change of countenance: </p><p> “Co-mmit suicide! They have practically done</p><p>that already:” </p><p> It was nearly two weeks later when the first</p><p>signs of a change of weather were manifested in </p><p>middle latitudes. It came on with a rapid veiling </p><p>of the sky, followed by a thin, misty, persistent rain. </p><p>The heat grew more oppressive, but the rain did</p><p>not become heavier, and after a few days there </p><p>would be, for several consecutive hours, a clear </p><p>spell, during which the sun would shine, though </p><p>with a sickly, pallid light. </p><p> There was a great deal of mystification abroad,</p><p>and nobody felt at ease. Still, the ebullitions of </p><p>terror that had accompanied the earlier caprices of </p><p>the elements were not renewed. People were get- </p><p>ting used to these freaks. </p><p> In the middle of one of the clear spells a remark-</p><p>able scene occurred at Mineola. </p><p> It was like a panorama of the seventh chapter of</p><p>Genesis. </p><p> It was the procession of the beasts.</p><p> Cosmo Versal had concluded that the time was</p><p>come for housing his animals in the ark. He wished </p><p>to accustom them to their quarters before the </p><p>voyage began. The resulting spectacle filled the </p><p>juvenile world with irrespressible joy, and im- </p><p>mensely interested their elders. </p><p> No march of a menagerie had ever come within</p><p>sight of equaling this display. Many of the beasts </p><p>were such as no one there had ever seen before. </p><p>Cosmo had consulted experts, but, in the end, he </p><p>had been guided in his choice by his own judgment. </p><p>Nobody knew as well as he exactly what was wanted. </p><p>He had developed in his mind a scheme for making </p><p>the new world that was to emerge from the waters </p><p>better in every respect than the old one. </p><p> Mingled with such familiar creatures as sheep,</p><p>cows, dogs, and barn-yard fowls, were animals of </p><p>the past, which the majority of the onlookers had </p><p>only read about or seen pictures of, or perhaps, in a </p><p>few cases, had been told of in childhood, by grand- </p><p>fathers long since sleeping in their graves. </p><p> Cosmo had rapidly collected them from all parts</p><p>of the world, but as they arrived in small con- </p><p>signments, and were carried in closed vans, very </p><p>few persons had any idea of what he was doing. </p><p> The greatest sensation was produced by four</p><p>beautiful horses, which had been purchased at an </p><p>enormous price from an English duke, who never </p><p>would have parted with them—for they were al- </p><p>most the last living representatives of the equine </p><p>race left on the earth—if financial stress had not </p><p>compelled the sacrifice. </p><p> These splendid animals were dapple gray, with</p><p>long white tails, and flowing manes borne proudly</p><p>on their arching necks, and as they were led at the </p><p>head of the procession, snorting at the unwonted </p><p>scene about them, their eyes bright with excitement, </p><p>prancing and curvetting, cries of admiration and </p><p>rounds of applause broke from the constantly grow- </p><p>ing throngs of spectators. </p><p> Those who had only known the horse from pic-</p><p>tures and sculptures were filled with astonishment </p><p>by its living beauty. People could not help saying </p><p>to themselves: </p><p> “What a pity that the honking auto, in its hun-</p><p>dred forms of mechanical ugliness, should have </p><p>driven these beautiful and powerful creatures out </p><p>of the world! What could our forefathers have </p><p>been thinking of?” </p><p> A few elephants, collected from African zoological</p><p>gardens, and some giraffes, also attracted a great </p><p>deal of attention, but the horses were the favorites </p><p>with the crowd. </p><p> Cosmo might have had lions and tigers, and simi-</p><p>lar beasts, which had been preserved in larger num- </p><p>bers than the useful horses, but when Joseph Smith </p><p>suggested their inclusion he shook his head, de- </p><p>claring that it was better that they should perish. </p><p>As far as possible, he averred, he would eliminate </p><p>all carnivores. </p><p> In some respects, even more interesting to the</p><p>onlookers than the animals of the past, were the </p><p>animals of the future that marched in the proces- </p><p>sion. Few of them had even been seen outside the </p><p>experimental stations where they had been under- </p><p>going the process of artificial evolution. </p><p> There were the stately white Californian cattle,</p><p>without horns, but of gigantic stature, the cows, </p><p>it was said, being capable of producing twenty </p><p>times more milk than their ancestral species, and a </p><p>vastly superior quality. </p><p> There were the Australian rabbits, as large as</p><p>Newfoundland dogs, though short-legged, and fur- </p><p>THE SECOND DELUGE </p><p>697 </p><p>nishing food of the most exquisite flavor, and the </p><p>Argentine sheep, great balls of snowy wool, moving </p><p>smartly along on legs three feet in length. </p><p> The greatest astonishment was excited by the</p><p>“grand Astoria terrapin,” a developed species of </p><p>diamond-back tortoise, whose exquisitely sculptured </p><p>convex back, lurching awkwardly as it crawled, rose </p><p>almost three feet above the ground; and the “new </p><p>century turkey,” which carried its beacon head and </p><p>staring eyes as high as a tall man's hat. </p><p> The end of the procession was formed of animals</p><p>familiar to everybody, and among them were cages </p><p>of monkeys (concerning whose educational develop- </p><p>ment-Cosmo Versal had theories of his own) and a </p><p>large variety of birds, together with boxes of in- </p><p>sect eggs and chrysalises. </p><p> The delight of the boys who had chased after the</p><p>procession culminated when the animals began to </p><p>ascend the sloping ways into the ark. </p><p> The horses shied and danced, making the metallic</p><p>flooring resound like a rattle of thunder; the ele- </p><p>phants trumpeted; the sheep baaed and crowded </p><p>themselves into inextricable masses against the </p><p>guard-rails; the huge new cattle moved lumberingly </p><p>up the slope, turning their big white heads inquir- </p><p>ingly about; the tall turkeys stretched their red </p><p>coral necks and gobbled with Brobdingnagian </p><p>voices; and the great terrapins were ignominiously </p><p>attached to cables and drawn up the side of the ark, </p><p>helplessly waving their immense flappers in the air. </p><p> And when the sensational entry was finished, the</p><p>satisfied crowd turned away, laughing, joking, chat- </p><p>tering, with never a thought that it was anything </p><p>more than the most amusing exhibition they had </p><p>ever seen I </p><p> But when they got back in the city streets they</p><p>met a flying squadron of yelling newsboys, and </p><p>seizing the papers from their hands read, in big </p><p>black letters: </p><p> “AWFUL FLOOD IN THE MISSISSIPPI!</p><p>Thousands of People Drowned! </p><p>THE STORM COMING THIS WAY!”1 </p><p> It was a startling commentary on the recent scene</p><p>at the ark, and many turned pale as they read. </p><p> But the storm did not come in the way expected.</p><p>The deluging rains appeared to be confined to the </p><p>Middle West and the Northwest, while at New York </p><p>the sky simply grew thicker and seemed to squeeze </p><p>out moisture in the form of watery dust. This con- </p><p>dition lasted for some time, and then came what </p><p>everybody, even the most skeptical, had been secret- </p><p>ly dreading. </p><p> The ocean began to rise!</p><p> The first perception of this startling fact, accord-</p><p>ing to a newspaper account, came in a very strange </p><p>roundabout way to a man living on the outskirts </p><p>of the vast area of made ground where the great </p><p>city had spread over what was formerly the Newark </p><p>meadows and Newark Bay. </p><p> About three o’clock in the morning, this man, who</p><p>it appears was a policeman off duty, was awakened </p><p>by scurrying sounds in the house. He struck a </p><p>light, and seeing dark forms issuing from the cel- </p><p>lar, went down to investigate. The ominous gleam </p><p>of water, reflecting the light of his lamp, told him </p><p>that the cellar was inundated almost to the top of </p><p>the walls. </p><p> “Come down here, Annie!” he shouted to his wife.</p><p>“Sure ’tis Coshrno Versal-al is invadin’ the cellar </p><p>with his flood. The rats are lavin’ us.” </p><p> Seeing that the slight foundation walls were</p><p>crumbling, he hurried his family into the street, </p><p>and not too soon, for within ten minutes the house </p><p>was in ruins. </p><p> Neighbors, living in equally frail structures, were</p><p>awakened, and soon other undermined houses fell. </p><p>Terror spread through the quarter, and gradually </p><p>half the city was aroused. </p><p> When day broke, residents along the water-front</p><p>in Manhattan found their cellars flooded, and South </p><p>and West Streets swimming with water, which was </p><p>continually rising. It was noted that the hour was </p><p>that of flood tide, but nobody had ever heard of a </p><p>tide so high as this. </p><p> Alarm deepened into terror when the time for the</p><p>tide to ebb arrived and there was no ebbing. On </p><p>the contrary, the water continued to rise. The </p><p>government observer at the Highlands telephoned </p><p>that Sandy Hook was submerged. Soon it was </p><p>known that Coney Island, Rockaway, and all the </p><p>seaside places along the south shore of Long Island </p><p>were under water. The mighty current poured in </p><p>through the Narrows with the velocity of a mill-</p><p>race. The Hudson, set backward on its course, </p><p>rushed northward with a raging bore at its head </p><p>that swelled higher until it licked the feet of the </p><p>rock chimneys of the Palisades. </p><p> But when the terror inspired by this sudden in-</p><p>vasion from the sea was at its height there came </p><p>unexpected relief. The water began to fall more </p><p>rapidly than it had risen. It rushed out through </p><p>the Narrows faster than it had rushed in, and ships, </p><p>dragged from their anchorage in the upper harbor, </p><p>were carried out seaward, some being stranded on </p><p>the sand-banks and shoals in the lower bay. </p><p> Now again houses standing on made ground,</p><p>whose foundations had been undermined, fell with a </p><p>crash, and many were buried in the ruins. </p><p> Notwithstanding the immense damage and loss</p><p>of life, the recession of the waters immediately had </p><p>a reassuring effect, and the public, in general, was </p><p>disposed to be comforted by the explanation of the </p><p>weather officials, who declared that what had oc- </p><p>curred was nothing more than an unprecedentedly </p><p>high tide, probably respiting from some unfore- </p><p>seen, disturbance out at sea. </p><p> The phenomenon had been noted all along the</p><p>Atlantic coast. The chief forecaster ventured the </p><p>assertion that a volcanic eruption had occurred </p><p>somewhere on the line from Halifax to Bermuda. </p><p>He thought that the probable location of the up- </p><p>heaval had been at Munn’s Reef, about half-way be- </p><p>tween those points, and the more he discussed his </p><p>theory the readier he became to stake his reputation </p><p>on its correctness, for, he said, it was impossible </p><p>that any combination of the effects of high and low </p><p>pressures could have created such a surge of the </p><p>ocean, while a volcanic wave, combining with the </p><p>regular oscillation of the tide, could have done it </p><p>easily. </p><p>698 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> But Cosmo Vers&amp;l smiled at this explanation, and</p><p>said in reply: </p><p> “The whole Arctic ice-cap is dissolved, and the</p><p>condensation of the nebula is at hand. But there </p><p>is worse behind. When the waves come back it will </p><p>rise higher.” </p><p> As the time for the next flood-tide grew near,</p><p>anxious eyes were on the watch to see how high </p><p>the water would go. There was something in the </p><p>mere manner of its approach that made the nerves </p><p>tingle. </p><p> It speeded toward the beaches, combing into</p><p>rollers at an unwonted distance from shore; plunged </p><p>with savage violence upon the sands of the shallows, </p><p>as if it would annihilate them; and then, spreading </p><p>swiftly, ran with terrific speed up the strand, seem- </p><p>ing to devour everything it touched. After each </p><p>recoil it sprang higher and roared louder and grew </p><p>blacker with the mud that it had ground up from </p><p>the bottom. Miles inland the ground trembled with </p><p>the fast-repeated shocks. </p><p> Again the Hudson was hurled backward until a</p><p>huge bore of water burst over the wharves at Al- </p><p>bany. Every foot of ground in New York less than </p><p>twenty feet above the mean high tide level was </p><p>inundated. The destruction was enormous, incalcul- </p><p>able. Ocean liners, moored along the wharves were, </p><p>in some cases, lifted above the level of the neighbor- </p><p>ing streets, and sent crashing into the buildings </p><p>along the water-front. </p><p> Etherograms told, in broken sentences, of similar</p><p>experiences on the western coasts of Europe, and </p><p>from the Pacific came the news of the flooding of </p><p>San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland, Tacoma, </p><p>Seattle, and every coast-lying town. On the western </p><p>coast of South America the incoming waves broke </p><p>among the foot-hills of the Andes. </p><p> It was as if the mighty basins of the world’s</p><p>two greatest oceans w-ere being rocked to and fro, </p><p>sending the waters spinning from side to side. </p><p> And to add to the horror of the situation, every</p><p>volcano on the globe seemed to burst simultaneously </p><p>into activity, probably through the effects of the </p><p>invasion of sea-water into the subterranean incan- </p><p>descence, while the strain of the unwonted weight </p><p>thrown upon the coasts broke open the tectonic </p><p>lines of weakness in the earth’s crust, causing the </p><p>most terrible earthquakes, which destroyed much</p><p>that the water could not reach. </p><p> From Alaska to Patagonia, from Kamchatka</p><p>through Japan to the East Indies, fi-om Mount </p><p>Hekla to Vesuvius, Etna, and Teneriffe, the raging </p><p>oceans were bordered with pouring clouds of vol- </p><p>canic smoke, hurled upward in swift succeeding </p><p>puffs, as if every crater had become the stack of </p><p>a stupendous steam-engine driven at its mad- </p><p>dest speed; while immense rivers of lava flamed </p><p>down the mountain flanks and plunged into the </p><p>invading waters with reverberated roarings, hiss- </p><p>ings and explosions that seemed to shake the frame- </p><p>work of the globe. </p><p> During the second awful shoreward heave of</p><p>the Atlantic a scene occurred off New York Bay </p><p>.that made the stoutest nerves quiver. A great </p><p>crowd had collected on the Highlands of the Nave- </p><p>sink to watch the ingress of the tidal wave. </p><p> Suddenly, afar off, the smoke of an approaching</p><p>ocean liner was seen. It needed but a glance to </p><p>show that she was struggling with tremendous </p><p>surges. Sometimes she sank completely out of sight; </p><p>then she reappeared, riding high on the waves. </p><p>Those who had glasses recognized her. Word ran </p><p>from mouth to mouth that it was the great Atlantis, </p><p>the mightiest of the ocean monarchs, of a hundred </p><p>thousand tons register, coming from Europe, and </p><p>bearing, without question, many thousands of souls. </p><p>She was flying signals of distress, and filling the </p><p>ether with her inarticulate calls for help, which </p><p>quavered into every radiograph station within a </p><p>radius of hundreds of miles. </p><p> But, at the same time, she was battling nobly for</p><p>herself and for the lives of her passengers and crew. </p><p>From her main peak the Stars and Stripes streamed </p><p>in the tearing wind. There were many in the watch- </p><p>ing throngs who personally knew her commander, </p><p>Captain Basil Brown, and who felt that if any hu- </p><p>man being could bring the laboring ship through </p><p>safely, he could. Aid from land was not to be </p><p>thought of. </p><p> As she swiftly drew nearer, hurled onward by the</p><p>resistless surges with the speed of an express-train, </p><p>the captain was recognized on his bridge, balancing </p><p>himself amid the lurches of the vessel; and even at </p><p>that distance, and in those terrible circumstances </p><p>there was something in his bearing perceptible to </p><p>those who breathlessly watched him, through power- </p><p>ful glasses, which spoke of perfect self-command, </p><p>entire absence of fear, and iron determination to </p><p>save his ship or die with her under his feet. </p><p> It could be seen that he was issuing orders and</p><p>watching their execution, but precisely what their </p><p>nature was, of course, could only be guessed. His </p><p>sole hope must be to keep the vessel from being </p><p>cast ashore. There was no danger from the shoals, </p><p>for they were by this time deeply covered by the </p><p>swelling of the sea. </p><p> Slowly, slowly, with a terrific straining of me-</p><p>chanic energies, which pressed the jaws of the </p><p>watchers together with spasmodic sympathy, as if </p><p>their own nervous power were cooperating in the </p><p>struggle, the gallant ship bore her head round to </p><p>face the driving waves. From the ten huge, red </p><p>stacks columns of inky black smoke poured out as </p><p>the stokers crammed the furnaces beneath. It was </p><p>man against nature, human nerve and mechanical </p><p>science against blind force. </p><p> It began to look as if the Atlantis would win the</p><p>battle. She was now fearfully close to the shore, but </p><p>her bow had been turned into the very eye of the </p><p>sea, and one could almost feel the tension of her </p><p>steel muscles as she seemed to spring to the en- </p><p>counter. The billows that split themselves in quick </p><p>succession on her sharp stem burst into shooting </p><p>geysers three hundred feet high. </p><p> The hearts of the spectators almost ceased to</p><p>beat. Their souls were wrapped up with the fate </p><p>of the brave ship. They forgot the terrors of their </p><p>own situation, the peril of the coming flood, and saw </p><p>nothing but the agonized struggle before their eyes. </p><p>With all their inward strength they prayed against </p><p>the ocean. </p><p> Such a contest could not last long. Suddenly, as</p><p>the Atlantis swerved a little aside, a surge that </p><p>towered above her loftiest deck rushed upon her. </p><p>THE SECOND DELUGE </p><p>699 </p><p>She was lifted like a cockleshell upon its crest, her </p><p>huge hull spun around, and the next minute, with </p><p>a crash that resounded above the roar of the mad- </p><p>dened sea, she was dashed in pieces. </p><p> At the very last moment before the vessel dis-</p><p>appeared in the whirling breakers, to be strewed </p><p>in broken and twisted bits of battered metal upon </p><p>the pounding sands, Captain Basil Brown was seen </p><p>on the commander’s bridge. </p><p> No sooner had this tragedy passed than the pent-</p><p>up terror broke forth, and men ran for their lives, </p><p>ran for their homes, ran to do something—some- </p><p>thing, but what?—to save themselves and their </p><p>dear ones. </p><p> For now, at last, they believed!</p><p> CHAPTER VIII</p><p> Storming the Ark</p><p>THERE was to be no more respite now. The </p><p>time of warnings was past. The “signs” </p><p>had all been shown to a skeptical and vacillat- </p><p>ing world, and at last the fulfilment was at hand. </p><p> There was no crying of “extras” in the streets,</p><p>for men had something more pressing to think of </p><p>than sending and reading news about their dis- </p><p>tresses and those of their fellow men. Every news- </p><p>paper ceased publication; every business place was </p><p>abandoned; there was no thought but of the means </p><p>of escape. </p><p> But how should they escape? And whither should</p><p>they fly? </p><p> The lower lying streets were under water. The</p><p>Atlantic still surged back and forth as if the ocean </p><p>itself were in agony. And every time the waves </p><p>poured in'they rose higher. The new shores of the </p><p>bay, and the new coasts of Long Island and New </p><p>Jersey, receding inward hour by hour, were strewn </p><p>with the wrecks of hundreds of vessels of all kinds </p><p>which had been caught by the surges and pitilessly </p><p>hurled to destruction. </p><p> Even if men did not yet fully believe in Cosmo</p><p>Versal's theory of a whelming nebula, they were </p><p>terrified to the bottom of their souls by the con- </p><p>viction, which nobody could resist, that the vast </p><p>ice-fields of the north, the glaciers of Greenland, </p><p>the icy mountains of Alaska, had melted away </p><p>under the terrible downpour of heat, and were swell-</p><p>ing the oceans over their brims. And then a greater </p><p>fear dropped like a blanket upon them. Some one </p><p>thought of the antarctic ice. </p><p> The latest despatches that had come, before the</p><p>cessation of all communication to the newspapers, </p><p>had told of the prevalence of stifling heat through- </p><p>out the southern hemisphere, and of the vast fleets </p><p>of antarctic icebergs that filled the south sea. The </p><p>mighty deposits of ice, towering to mountain </p><p>heights, that stretched a thousand miles in every </p><p>direction around the south pole, were melting as the </p><p>arctic ice had melted, and, when the water thus </p><p>formed was added to the already overflowing seas, </p><p>to what elevation might not the flood attain! </p><p> The antarctic ice was known to be the principal</p><p>mass of frozen water on the globe. The frigid cap </p><p>of the north was nothing in comparison with it. </p><p>It had long been believed that the weight of that </p><p>tremendous accumulation unbalanced the globe and </p><p>was the chief cause of the unsteadiness of the </p><p>earth’s axis of rotation. </p><p> Every fresh exploration had only Served to</p><p>magnify the conception of the incredible vastness </p><p>of that deposit. The skirts of the Antarctic Con- </p><p>tinent had proved to be rich in minerals wherever </p><p>the rocks could find a place to penetrate through </p><p>the gigantic burden of ice, and the principal nations </p><p>had quarreled over the possession or control of these </p><p>protruding bits of wealth-crammed strata. But be- </p><p>hind the bordering cliffs of ice, rising in places a </p><p>thousand feet above the level of the sea, and tower- </p><p>ing farther inland so high that this region became, </p><p>in mean elevation, the loftiest on the planet, nothing </p><p>but ice could be seen. </p><p> And now that ice was dissolving and flowing into</p><p>the swollen oceans, adding billions of tons of water </p><p>every minute! </p><p> Men did not stop to calculate, as Cosmo Versal</p><p>had done, just how much the dissolution of all the </p><p>ice and permanent snow of the globe would add to </p><p>the volume of the seas. He knew that it would be </p><p>but a drop in the bucket—although sufficient to </p><p>start the flood—and that the great thing to be </p><p>feared was the condensation of the aqueous nebula, </p><p>already beginning to enwrap the planet in its stifl- </p><p>ing folds. </p><p> The public could understand the melting ice, al-</p><p>though it could not fully understand the nebula; it </p><p>could understand the swelling sea, and the raging </p><p>rivers, and the lakes breaking over their banks—*s </p><p>and the terror and despair became universal.</p><p> But what should they do?</p><p> Those who had thought of building arks hur-</p><p>ried to see if the work might not yet be completed, </p><p>but most of them had begun their foundations on </p><p>low land, which was already submerged. </p><p> Then a cry arose, terrible in its significance and</p><p>in its consequences—one of those cries that the van- </p><p>ished but unconquerable god Pan occasionally sets </p><p>ring, nobody can tell how: </p><p> “Cosmo’s ark! Get aboard! Storm it!”</p><p> And thereupon there was a mighty rush for</p><p>Mineola. Nobody who caught the infection stopped </p><p>to reason. Some of them had to wade through </p><p>water, which in places was knee-deep. They came </p><p>from various directions, and united in a yelling </p><p>mob. They meant to carry the ark with a rush, </p><p>They would not be denied. As the excited throngs </p><p>neared the great vessel they saw its huge form ris- </p><p>ing like a mount of safety, with an American flag </p><p>flapping about it, and they broke into a mighty </p><p>cheer. On they sped, seized with the unreason of a </p><p>crowd, shouting, falling over one another, strug- </p><p>gling, fighting for places, men dragging their </p><p>wives and children through the awful crush, many </p><p>trampled helpless under the myriads of struggling </p><p>feet—driving the last traces of sanity from one an- </p><p>other’s minds. </p><p> The foremost ranks presently spied Cosmo Vers&amp;l,</p><p>watching them from an open gangway sixty feet </p><p>above their heads. They were dismayed at finding </p><p>the approaches gone. How should they get into the </p><p>ark? How could they climb up its vertical sides? </p><p> But they would find means. They Would re-erect</p><p>the approaches. They would get in somehow. </p><p> Cosmo waved them off with frantic gesticula-</p><p>\ </p><p>700 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>tions; then, through a trumpet, he shouted in a </p><p>voice audible above the din: </p><p> "Keep back, for your lives!”</p><p> But they paid no attention to him; they rushed</p><p>upon the raised wall, surrounding the field where </p><p>Cosmo had buried his mysterious lines of wire. </p><p>Then the meaning of that enigmatical work was </p><p>flashed upon them. </p><p> As the first arrivals laid their hands upon the</p><p>top of the low wall they fell as if shot through the </p><p>brain, tumbling backward on those behind. Others </p><p>pushed wildly on, but the instant they touched the </p><p>wall they too collapsed. Wicked blue-green sparks </p><p>occasionally flashed above the struggling mass. </p><p> The explanation was clear. Cosmo, foreseeing</p><p>the probability of a despairing attack, had sur- </p><p>rounded the ark with an impassable electric barrier. </p><p>The sound of a whirring dynamo could be heard. A </p><p>tremendous current was flowing through the hidden </p><p>wires and transmitting its paralyzing energy to the </p><p>metallic crest of the wall. </p><p> Still those behind pushed on, until rank after</p><p>rank had sunk helpless at the impregnable line of </p><p>defense. They were not killed—at least, not many </p><p>—but the shock was so paralyzing that those who </p><p>had experienced its effect made no further at- </p><p>tempts to cross the barrier. Many lay for a time </p><p>helpless upon the sodden ground. </p><p> Cosmo and Joseph Smith, who had now appeared</p><p>at his side, continued to shout warnings, which </p><p>began to be heeded when the nature of the obstacle </p><p>became known. The rush was stopped, and the </p><p>multitude stood at bay, dazed, and uncertain what </p><p>to do. Then a murmur arose, growing louder and </p><p>more angry and threatening, until suddenly a shot </p><p>was heard in the midst of the crowd, and Cosmo </p><p>was seen to start backward, while Joseph Smith </p><p>instantly dodged out of sight. </p><p> A cry arose:</p><p> "Shoot him! That’s right! Shoot the devil!</p><p>He’s a witch! He’s drowning the world!” </p><p> They meant it—at least, half of them did. It</p><p>was the logic of terror. </p><p> Hundreds of shots were now fired from all</p><p>quarters, and heads that had been seen flitting be-</p><p>hind the various portholes instantly disappeared. </p><p>The bullets rattled on the huge sides of the ark, </p><p>but they came from small pistols and had not force </p><p>enough to penetrate. </p><p> Cosmo Versal alone remained in sight. Occasion-</p><p>ally a quick motion showed that even his nerves </p><p>were not steady enough to defy the whistling of the </p><p>bullets passing close; but he held his ground, and </p><p>stretched out his hand to implore attention. </p><p> When the fusillade ceased for a moment he put</p><p>his trumpet again to his lips and shouted: </p><p> “I have done my best to save you, but you would</p><p>not listen. Although I know that you must perish, </p><p>I would not myself harm a hair of your heads. </p><p>Go back, I implore you. You may prolong your </p><p>lives if you will fly to the highlands and the moun- </p><p>tains—but here you cannot enter. The ark is full” </p><p> Another volley of shots was the only answer.</p><p>One broad-shouldered man forced his way to the </p><p>front, took his stand close to the wall, and yelled </p><p>in stentorian tones: </p><p> “Cosmo Versal, listen to me! You are the curse</p><p>of the world! You have brought this flood upon </p><p>us with your damnable incantations. Your in- </p><p>fernal nebula is. the seal of Satan! Here, beast and </p><p>devil, here at my feet, lies my only son, slaih by </p><p>your hellish device. By the Eternal I swear you </p><p>shall go back to the pit!” </p><p> Instantly a pistol flashed in the speaker’s hand,</p><p>and five shots rang in quick succession. One after </p><p>another they whistled by Cosmo's head and flatten- </p><p>ed themselves upon the metal-work behind. Cosmo </p><p>Versal, untouched, folded his arms and looked </p><p>straight at his foe. The man, staring a moment </p><p>confusedly, as if he could not comprehend his </p><p>failure, threw up his arms with a despairing ges- </p><p>ture, and fell prone upon the ground. </p><p> Then yells and shots once more broke out. Cos-</p><p>mo stepped back, and a great metallic door swung </p><p>to, closing the gang-way. </p><p>But three minutes later the door opened, and </p><p>the mob saw two machine-guns trained upon them. </p><p>Once more Cosmo appeared, with the trumpet. </p><p>“If you fire again,” he cried, “I shall spray you </p><p>with bullets. I have told you how you can pro- </p><p>long your lives. Now go!” </p><p> Not another shot was fired. In the face of the</p><p>guns, whose terrible power all comprehended, no </p><p>one dared to make a hostile movement.</p><p> But, perhaps, if Cosmo Versal had not set new</p><p>thoughts running in the minds of the assailants by </p><p>telling them there was temporary safety to be </p><p>found by seeking high ground, even the terror of </p><p>the guns would not have daunted them. Now their </p><p>hopefulness was reawakened, and many began to </p><p>ponder upon his words. </p><p> "He says we must perish, and yet that we can</p><p>find safety in the hills and mountains,” said one </p><p>man. "I believe half of that is a lie. We are not </p><p>going to be drowned. The water won’t rise much </p><p>higher. The flood from the south pole that they </p><p>talk about must be here by this time, and then </p><p>what’s left to come?” </p><p> "The nebula,” suggested one.</p><p> “Aw, the nebula be hanged! There’s no such</p><p>thing! I live on high ground; I'm going to keep </p><p>a sharp outlook, and if the water begins to shut </p><p>off Manhattan I’ll take my family up the Hudson </p><p>to the Highlands. I guess old Storm King’ll keep </p><p>his head above. That’s where I come from—up </p><p>that way. I used to hear people say when I Vas </p><p>a boy that New York was bound to sink some day. </p><p>I used to laugh at that then, but it looks mighty </p><p>like it now, don’t it?” </p><p> “Say,”~put in another, "what did the fellow</p><p>mean by saying the ark was full? That’s funny, </p><p>ain’t it? Who’s he got inside, anyway?” </p><p> “Oh, he ain’t got nobody,” said another.</p><p> “Yes, he has. I seen a goodish lot through the</p><p>port-holes. He’s got somebody, sure.” </p><p> "A lot of fools like himself, most likely.”</p><p> “Well, if he’s a fool, and they’s fools, what are</p><p>we, I’d like to know? What did you come here </p><p>for, hey?” </p><p> It was a puzzling question, followed by the re-</p><p>mark: </p><p> "I guess' we fooled ourselves considerable. We</p><p>got scared too easy.” </p><p>THE SECOND DELUGE </p><p>701 </p><p> “Maybe you’ll feel scared again when you see</p><p>the water climbing up the streets in New York. </p><p>I don’t half like this thing. I’m going to follow </p><p>his advice and light out for higher ground.” </p><p> Soon conversation of this sort was heard on all</p><p>sides, and the crowd began to disperse, only those </p><p>lingering behind who had friends or relatives that </p><p>had been struck down at the fatal wall. It turned </p><p>out that not more than one or two had been mor- </p><p>tally shocked. The rest were able to limp away, and </p><p>many had fully recovered within five minutes after </p><p>suffering the shock. In half an hour not a dozen </p><p>persons were in sight from the ark. </p><p> But when the retreating throngs drew near the</p><p>shores of the Sound, and the East River, which </p><p>had expanded into a true arm of the sea, and </p><p>found that there had been a perceptible rise since </p><p>they set out to capture the ark, they began to shake </p><p>their heads and fear once more entered their </p><p>hearts. </p><p> Thousands then and there resolved that they</p><p>would not lose another instant in setting out for </p><p>high land, up the Hudson, in Connecticut, among </p><p>the hills of New Jersey. In fact, many had al- </p><p>ready fled thither, some escaping on aeros; and </p><p>hosts would now have followed but for a marvelous </p><p>change that came just before nightfall and pre- </p><p>vented them. </p><p> For some days the heavens had alternately dark-</p><p>ened and lightened, as gushes of mist came and </p><p>went, but there had been no actual rain. Now, </p><p>without warning, a steady downpour began. Even </p><p>at the beginning it would have been called, in or- </p><p>dinary times, a veritable cloudburst; but it rapid- </p><p>ly grew worse and worse, until there was no word </p><p>in the vernacular or in the terminology of science </p><p>to describe it. </p><p> It seemed, in truth, that “all the fountains of</p><p>the great deep were broken up, and the windows of </p><p>heaven were opened.” The water thundered upon </p><p>the roofs, and poured off them in torrents. In five </p><p>minutes every sloping street had become an angry </p><p>riVer, and every level place a swelling lake. People </p><p>caught out of doors were almost beaten to the </p><p>ground by the force of the water falling upon them </p><p>as if they had been standing under a cataract. </p><p>*	In a short time every cellar and every base-</p><p>ment was filled to overflowing, and in the avenues </p><p>the flood, lapping every instant higher upon the</p><p>door-steps and the walls, rushed by with frightful </p><p>roarings, bearing in its awful embrace pieces of </p><p>furniture, clothing, bedding, washed out of </p><p>ground-floor rooms—and, alas! human beings; </p><p>some motionless, already mercifully deprived of </p><p>life, but others struggling and shouting for aid </p><p>which could not be given. </p><p> So terrible a spectacle no one had ever.looked</p><p>tipon, no one had ever imagined. Those who be- </p><p>held it were too stunned to cry out, too overwhelmed </p><p>with terror and horror to utter a word. They </p><p>stood, or* fell into chairs or upon the floor, trem- </p><p>bling in every limb, with staring eyes and droop- </p><p>ing jaws, passively awaiting their fate. </p><p> As night came on there was no light. The</p><p>awful darkness of the Third Sign once more set- </p><p>tled upon the great city, but now it was not the </p><p>terror of indefinite expectation that crushed down </p><p>the souls of men and women—it was the weight </p><p>of doom accomplished! </p><p> There was no longer any room for self-deception;</p><p>every quaking heart felt now that the nebula, had </p><p>come. Cosmo Versal had been right! </p><p> After the water had attained a certain height</p><p>in the street and yards, depending upon the ratio </p><p>■between the amount descending from the sky and </p><p>that 'which could find its way to the rivers, the </p><p>flood for the time being rose no higher. The </p><p>actual drowning of New York could not happen </p><p>until the Hudson and the East River should be- </p><p>come so swollen that the water would stand above </p><p>the level of the highest buildings, and turn the </p><p>whole region round about, as far as the Orange </p><p>hills, the Ramapo Mountains, the Highland, and </p><p>the Housatonic hills, into an inland sea. </p><p> But before we tell that story we must return to</p><p>see what was going on at Mineola. Cosmo Versal </p><p>on that awful night when New York first knew </p><p>beyond the shadow of a doubt, or the gleam of a; </p><p>hope, that it was doomed, presided over a remark- </p><p>able assembly in the grand saloon of his ark. </p><p>CHAPTER IX </p><p>The Company of the Reprieved </p><p>HOW did it happen that Cosmo Versal wai </p><p>able to inform the mob, when it assailed </p><p>the ark that he had no room left? </p><p> Who composed his ship’s company, whence had</p><p>they come, and how had they managed to embark </p><p>without the knowledge of the public?</p><p> The explanation is quite simple. It was all due</p><p>to the tremendous excitement that had prevailed </p><p>ever since the sea began to overflow. In the univer- </p><p>sal confusion people had to think of other things </p><p>nearer their dogrs than the operations of Cosmo </p><p>Versal. Sincethe embarkation of the animals the </p><p>crowds had ceased to visit the field at Mineola, and </p><p>it was only occasionally that even a reporter was </p><p>sent there. Accordingly, there were many hours </p><p>every day when no curiosity-seekers were in sight </p><p>of the ark, and at night the neighborhood was de- </p><p>serted ; and this state of affairs continued until the </p><p>sudden panic which led to the attack that has been </p><p>described. </p><p> Cosmo Versal, of course, had every reason to</p><p>conceal the fact that he was carefully selecting </p><p>his company. It was a dangerous game to play, </p><p>and he knew it. The consequence was that he en- </p><p>joined secrecy upon his invited guests, and con- </p><p>ducted them, a few at a time, into the ark, assuring </p><p>them that their lives might be in peril if they were </p><p>recognized. And once under the domain of the </p><p>fear which led them to. accept his invitation, they </p><p>were no less anxious than he to avoid publicity. </p><p>Some of them probably desired to avoid recogni- </p><p>tion through dread of ridicule; for, after all, the </p><p>flood might not turn out to be so bad as Cosmo </p><p>had predicted. </p><p> So it happened that the ark was filled, little by</p><p>little, and the public knew nothing about it. </p><p>And who composed the throng which, while the </p><p>awful downpour roared on the ellipsoidal cover of- </p><p>(Continued on Page 767) </p><p>9he ISMSB 0/BrMOREAU </p><p>v 3tf MG Mils •* </p><p>Author of “The War of the Worlds”, “The Abyss”, ctc. </p><p>I faccd these people, facing my fate in them, single-handed now,—literally single-handed, for I had a broken arm.

I warn you that this is</p><p> the last I shall do to oblige you. The next thing</p><p> you threaten to commit suicide about, I sha’n’t do,</p><p> —even at some personal inconvenience.”</p><p> He sat in my deck chair, a cigar half consumed in</p><p> his white, dexterous-Iooking fingers. The light of</p><p> the swinging lamp fell on his white hair; he stared</p><p> through the little window out at the starlight. I</p><p> sat as far away from him as possible, the table be-</p><p> tween us and the revolvers to hand. Montgomery</p><p> was not present. I did not care to be with the two</p><p> of them in such a little room.</p><p> “You admit that the</p><p> vivisected human being,</p><p> as you called it, is, after</p><p> all, only the puma?” said</p><p> Moreau.

It is of such quality as zvill leave</p><p> a lasting impression, which in these days is true of few</p><p> stories. We have aft idea that Mr. Wells, when he wrote</p><p> this story, did it as a travesty on humans and their thin</p><p> coat of civilisation veneer, thereby exposing the human</p><p> race and its foibles. If that was his intention, he certainly</p><p> succeeded.</p><p> Montgomery used to</p><p> You admit that it is the puma.</p><p> Now be quiet, while I reel off my physiological lec-</p><p> ture to you.”</p><p> And forthwith, beginning in the tone of a man</p><p> supremely bored, but presently warming a little, he</p><p> explained his work to me. He was very simple</p><p> and convincing. Now and then there was a touch</p><p> of sarcasm in his voice. Presently I found myself</p><p> hot with shame at our mutual positions.</p><p> The creatures I had seen were not men, had never</p><p> been men. They were animals, humanised animals,</p><p> —triumphs of vivisection.</p><p> “You forget all that a skilled vivisector can do</p><p> with living things,” said Moreau. “For my own</p><p> part, I’m puzzled why the things I have done here</p><p> have not been done before. Small efforts, of course,</p><p> have been made,—amputation, tongue-cutting, ex-</p><p> cisions. Of course you know squint may be in-</p><p> duced or cured by surgery? Then in the case of</p><p> excisions you have'all kinds of secondary changes,</p><p> pigmentary disturbances, modifications of the pas-</p><p> sions, alterations in the secretion of fatty tissue.</p><p> I have no doubt you have heard of these thing?”</p><p> “Of course,” said I. “But these foul creatures</p><p> of yours—”</p><p> “All in good time,” said he, waving his hand at</p><p> me; “I am only beginning. Those are trivial cases</p><p> of alteration. Surgery can do better things than</p><p> that. There is building up as well as breaking</p><p> down and changing. You have heard, perhaps, of</p><p> a common surgical opera-</p><p> tion resorted to in cases</p><p> where the nose has been</p><p> destroyed: a flap of skin</p><p> is cut from the forehead,</p><p> turned down on the nose,</p><p> and heals in the new posi-</p><p> tion. This is a kind of</p><p> grafting in a new position</p><p> of part of an animal ap-</p><p> on itself. Grafting of</p><p> freshly obtained material</p><p> from another animal is al-</p><p> so possible,—the case of</p><p> teeth, for example. The</p><p> grafting of skin and bone</p><p> is done to facilitate healing: the surgeon places in</p><p> the middle of the wound pieces of skin snipped</p><p> from another animal, or fragments of bone from a</p><p> victim freshly killed. Hunter’s cockspur—possibly</p><p> you have heard of that—flourished on the bull’s</p><p> neck; and the rhinoceros rats of the Algerian</p><p> zouaves are also to be thought of,—monsters manu-</p><p> factured by transferring a slip from the tail of an</p><p> ordinary rat to its snout, and allowing it to heal</p><p> in that position.”</p><p> “Monsters manufactured!’</p><p> mean to tell me—”</p><p> said I. “Then you</p><p>703 </p><p>704 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> “Yes. These creatures you have seen are animals</p><p>carven and 'wrought into new shapes. To that, to </p><p>the study of the plasticity of living forms, my life </p><p>has been devoted. I have studied for years, gain- </p><p>ing in knowledge as I go. I see you look horrified, </p><p>and yet I am telling you nothing new. It all lay </p><p>in the surface of practical anatomy years ago, but </p><p>no one had the temerity to touch it. It’s </p><p>not simply the outward form of an animal which </p><p>I can change. The physiology, the chemical rhythm </p><p>of the creature, may also be made to undergo an </p><p>enduring modification,—of which vaccination and </p><p>other methods of inoculation with living or dead </p><p>matter are examples that will, no doubt, be familiar </p><p>to you. A similar operation is the transfusion of </p><p>blood,—with which subjeot, indeed, I began. These </p><p>are all familiar cases. Less so, and probably far </p><p>more extensive, were the operations of those mediae- </p><p>val practitioners who made dwarfs and beggar-crip- </p><p>ples, show-monsters,—some vestiges of whose art </p><p>still remain in the preliminary manipulation of the </p><p>young mountebank or contortionist. Victor Hugo </p><p>gives an account of them in ‘L’Homme qui Hit.’— </p><p>But perhaps ray meaning grows plain now. You </p><p>begin to see that it is a possible thing to transplant </p><p>tissue from one part of an animal to another, or </p><p>from one animal to another; to alter its chemical </p><p>reactions and methods of growth; to modify the </p><p>articulations of its limbs; and, indeed, to change </p><p>it in its most intimate structure. </p><p> “And yet this extraordinary branch of knowledge</p><p>has never been sought as an end, and systematically, </p><p>by modern investigators until I took it up! Some </p><p>of such things have been hit upon in the last re- </p><p>sort of surgery; most of the kindred evidence that </p><p>will recur to your mind has been demonstrated as </p><p>it were by accident,—by tyrants, by criminals, by </p><p>the breeders of horses and dogs, by all kinds of un- </p><p>trained, clumsy-handed men working for their own </p><p>immediate ends. I was the first man to take up this </p><p>question armed with antiseptic surgery, and with a </p><p>really scientific knowledge of the laws of growth. </p><p>Yet one would imagine it must have been practised </p><p>in secret before. Such creatures as the Siamese </p><p>Twins—And in the vaults of the Inquisition. No </p><p>doubt their chief aim was artistic torture, but some </p><p>at least of the inquisitors must have had a touch of </p><p>scientific curiosity." </p><p> “But,” said I, “these things—these animals talk!"</p><p> He said that was so, and proceeded to point out</p><p>that the possibility of vivisection does not stop at </p><p>a mere physical metamorphosis. A pig may be</p><p>educated. The mental structure is even less deter- </p><p>minate than the bodily. In our growing science of </p><p>hypnotism we find the promise of a possibility of </p><p>superseding old inherent instincts by new sugges- </p><p>tions, grafting upon or replacing the inherited fixed </p><p>ideas. Very much indeed of what we call moral </p><p>education, ho said, is such an artificial modification </p><p>and perversion of instinct; pugnacity is trained in- </p><p>to courageous self-sacrifice, and suppressed sexual- </p><p>ity into religious emotion. And the great differ- </p><p>ence between man and monkey is in the larynx, </p><p>he continued,—'in the incapacity to frame deli- </p><p>cately different sound-symbols by which thought </p><p>could be sustained. In this I failed to agree with </p><p>him, but with a certafh incivility he declined to </p><p>notice my objection. He repeated that the thing </p><p>was so, and continued his account of his work. </p><p> I asked him why he had taken the human form</p><p>as a model. There seemed to me then, and there </p><p>still seems to me now, a strange wickedness for that </p><p>choice. </p><p> He confessed that he had chosen that form by</p><p>chance. “I might just as well have worked to form </p><p>sheep into llamas and llamas into sheep. I suppose </p><p>there is something in the human form that appeals </p><p>to the artistic turn more powerfully than any </p><p>animal shape can. But I’ve not confined myself to </p><p>man-making. Once or twice—” He was silent, for </p><p>a minute perhaps. “These years! How they have </p><p>slipped by! And here I have wasted a day saving </p><p>your life, and am now wasting an hour explaining </p><p>myself.” </p><p> “But,” said I, “I still do not understand. Where</p><p>is your justification for inflicting all this pain? </p><p>The only thing that could excuse vivisection to </p><p>me would be some application—” </p><p> “Precisely,” said he. “But, you see, I am differ-</p><p>ently constituted. We are on different platforms. </p><p>You are a materialist.” </p><p> “I am not a materialist,” I began hotly.</p><p> “In my view—in my view. For it is just this</p><p>question of pain that parts us. So long as visible </p><p>or audible pain turns you sick; so long as your own </p><p>pains drive you; so long as pain underlies your pro- # </p><p>positions about sin,— so long, I tell you, you are an * </p><p>animal, thinking a little less obscurely what an </p><p>animal feels. This pain—” </p><p> I gave an impatient shrug at such sophistry.</p><p> “Oh, but it is such a little thing! A mind truly</p><p>opened to what science has to teach must see that </p><p>it is a little thing. It may be that save in this little </p><p>planet, this speck of cosmic dust, invisible long be- </p><p>fore the nearest star could be attained,—it may be, </p><p>I say, that nowhere else does this thing called pain </p><p>occur. But the laws we feel our way towards— </p><p>Why, even on this earth, even among living things, </p><p>what pain is there?” </p><p> As he spoke he drew a little penknife from his</p><p>pocket, opened the smaller blade, and moved his </p><p>chair so that I could see his thigh. Then, choosing </p><p>the place deliberately, he drove the blade into his </p><p>leg and withdrew it. </p><p> “No doubt,” he said, “you have seen that before.</p><p>It does not hurt a pin-prick. But what does it </p><p>show? The capacity for pain is not needed in the </p><p>muscle, and it is not placed there,—is but little </p><p>needed in the skin, and only here and there over the </p><p>thigh is a spot capable of feeling pain. Pain is </p><p>simply our intrinsic medical adviser to warn us </p><p>and stimulate us. Not all living flesh is painful; </p><p>nor is all nerve, not even all sensory nerve. There’s </p><p>no tint of pain, real pain, in the sensations of the </p><p>optic nerve. If you wound the optic nerve, you </p><p>merely see flashes of light,—just as disease of the </p><p>auditory nerve merely means a humming in our </p><p>ears. Plants do not feel pain, nor the lower ani- </p><p>mals ; it’s possible that such animals as the starfish </p><p>and crayfish do not feel pain at all. Then with </p><p>men, the more intelligent they become, the more in- </p><p>telligently they will see after their own welfare, </p><p>and the less they will need the goad to keep them </p><p>out of danger. I never yet heard of a useless </p><p>THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU </p><p>705 </p><p>thing' that was not ground out of existence by evo- </p><p>lution sooner or later. Did you? And pain gets </p><p>needless. </p><p> “Then I am a religious man, Prendick, as every</p><p>sane man must be. It may be, I fancy, that I have </p><p>seen more of the ways of this world’s Maker than </p><p>you,—for I have sought His laws, in my way, all my </p><p>life, while you, I understand, have been collecting </p><p>butterflies. And I tell you, pleasure and pain have </p><p>nothing to do with heaven or hell. Pleasure and </p><p>pain—bah! What is your theologian’s ecstasy but </p><p>Mahomet’s houri in the dark? This store which men </p><p>and women set on pleasure and pain, Prendick, is </p><p>the mark of the beast upon them,—the mark of </p><p>the beast from which they came! Pain, pain and </p><p>pleasure, they are for us only so long as we wriggle </p><p>in the dust. </p><p> “You see, I went on with this research just the</p><p>way it led me. That is the only way I ever heard of </p><p>true research going. I asked a question, devised </p><p>some method of obtaining an answer, and got a </p><p>fresh question. Was this possible or that possible? </p><p>You cannot imagine what this means to an in- </p><p>vestigator, what an intellectual passion grows up- </p><p>on him! You cannot imagine the strange, colourless </p><p>delight of these intellectual desires! The thing be- </p><p>fore you is no longer an animal, a fellow-creature, </p><p>but a problem! Sympathetic pain,—all I know of it </p><p>I remember as a thing I used to suffer from years </p><p>ago. I wanted—it was the one thing I wanted—to </p><p>find out the extreme limit of plasticity in a living </p><p>shape.” </p><p> “But,” said I, “the thing is an abomination—”</p><p> “To this day I have never troubled about the</p><p>ethics of the matter,” he continued. “The study </p><p>of Nature makes a man at last as remorseless as </p><p>Nature. I have gone on, not heeding anything but </p><p>the question I was pursuing; and the material has </p><p>—dripped into the huts yonder. It is really eleven </p><p>years since we came here, I and Montgomery and </p><p>six Kanakas. I remember the green stillness of the </p><p>island and the empty ocean about us, as though it </p><p>was yesterday. The place seemed waiting for me. </p><p> “The stores were landed and the house was</p><p>built. The Kanakas founded some huts near the </p><p>ravine. I went to work here upon what I had </p><p>brought with me. There were some disagreeable </p><p>things happened at first. I began with a sheep, and </p><p>killed it after a day and a half by a slip of the</p><p>scalpel. I took another sheep, and made a thing </p><p>of pain and fear and left it bound up to heal. It </p><p>looked quite human to me when I had finished it; </p><p>but when I went to it I was discontented with it. </p><p>It remembered me, and was terrified beyond </p><p>imagination; and it had no more than the wits </p><p>of a sheep. The more I looked at it the clumsier </p><p>it seemed, until at last I put the monster out of its </p><p>misery. These animals without courage, these fear- </p><p>haunted, pain-driven things, without a spark of </p><p>pugnacious energy to face torment,—they are no </p><p>good for man-making. </p><p> “Then I took a gorilla I had; and upon that, work-</p><p>ing with infinite care and mastering difficulty after </p><p>difficulty, I made my first man. All the week, night </p><p>and day, I moulded him. With him it was chiefly </p><p>the brain that needed moulding; much had to be </p><p>added, much changed. I thought him a fair speci- </p><p>men of the negroid type when I had finished him, </p><p>and he lay bandaged, bound, and motionless before </p><p>me. It was only when his life was assured that I </p><p>left him and came into this room again, and found </p><p>Montgomery much as you are. He had heard some </p><p>of the cries as the thing grew human,—cries like </p><p>those that disturbed you so. I didn’t take him </p><p>completely into my. confidence at first. And the </p><p>Kanakas too, had realised something of it. They </p><p>were scared out of their wits by the sight of me. </p><p>I got Montgomery over to me—in a way; but I </p><p>and he had the hardest job to prevent the Kanakas </p><p>deserting. Finally they did; and so we lost the </p><p>yacht. I spent many days educating the brute,— </p><p>altogether I had him for three or four months. </p><p>I taught him the rudiments of English; gave him </p><p>ideas of counting; even made the thing read the </p><p>alphabet. But at that he was slow, though I’ve </p><p>met with idiots slower. He began with a clean </p><p>sheet, mentally; had no memories left in his mind </p><p>of what he had been. When his scars were quite </p><p>healed, and he was no longer anything but painful </p><p>and stiff, and able to converse a little, I took him </p><p>yonder and introduced him to the Kanakas as an </p><p>interesting stowaway. </p><p> “They were horribly afraid of him at first, some-</p><p>how,—which offended me rather, for I was con- </p><p>ceited about him; but his ways seemed so mild, and </p><p>he was so abject, that after a time they received </p><p>him and took his education in hand. He was quick </p><p>to learn, very imitative and adaptive, and built him- </p><p>self a hovel rather better, it seemed to me, than </p><p>their own shanties. There was one among the boys </p><p>a bit of a missionary, and he taught the thing to </p><p>read, or at least to pick out letters, and gave him </p><p>some rudimentary ideas of morality; but it seems </p><p>the beast’s habits were not all that is desirable.</p><p> “I rested from work for some days after this, and</p><p>was in a mind to write an account of the whole </p><p>affair to wake up English physiology. Then I came </p><p>upon the creature squatting up in a tree and gibber- </p><p>ing at two of the Kanakas who had been teasing </p><p>him. I threatened him, told him the inhumanity of </p><p>such a proceeding, aroused his sense of shame, and </p><p>came home resolved to do better before I took my </p><p>work back to England. I have been doing better. </p><p>But somehow the things drift back again: the stub- </p><p>born beast-flesh grows day by day back again. But </p><p>I mean to do better things still. I mean to conquer </p><p>that. This puma— </p><p> “But that’s the story. All the Kanaka boys are</p><p>dead now; one fell overboard off the launch, and one </p><p>died of a wounded heel that he poisoned in some </p><p>way with plant-juice. Three went away in the </p><p>yacht, and I suppose and hope were drowned. The </p><p>other one—was killed. Well, I have replaced them. </p><p>Montgomery went on much as you are disposed to </p><p>do at first, and then—” </p><p> “What became of the other one?” said I, sharply,</p><p>—“the other Kanaka who was killed?” </p><p> “The fact is, after I had made a number of hu-</p><p>man creatures I made a Thing.” He hesitated. </p><p> “Yes,” said I.</p><p> “It was killed.”</p><p> “I don’t understand,” said I; “do you mean to</p><p>say—” </p><p> “It killed the Kanakas—yes. It killed several</p><p>706 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>other things it caught. We chased it for a couple </p><p>of days. It only got loose by accident—I never </p><p>meant it to get away. It wasn't finished. It was </p><p>purely an experiment. It was a limbless thing, with </p><p>a horrible face, that writhed along the ground in </p><p>a serpentine fashion. It was immensely strong, and </p><p>in infuriating pain. It lurked in the woods for some </p><p>days, until we hunted it; and then it wriggled into </p><p>the northern part of the island, and we divided </p><p>the party to close in upon it. Montgomery insisted </p><p>upon coming with me. The man had a rifle; and </p><p>when his body was found, one of the barrels was </p><p>curved into the shape of an S and very nearly bit- </p><p>ten through. Montgomery shot the thing. After </p><p>that I stuck to the ideal of humanity—except for </p><p>little things.” </p><p> He became silent. I sat in silence watching his</p><p>face. </p><p> “So for twenty years altogether—counting nine</p><p>years in England—I have been going on; and there </p><p>is still something in everything I do that defeats </p><p>me, makes me dissatisfied, challenges me to further </p><p>effort. Sometimes I rise above my level, sometimes </p><p>I fall below it; but always I fall short of the things </p><p>I dream. The human shape I can get now, almost </p><p>with ease, so that it is lithe and graceful, or thick </p><p>and strong; but often there is trouble with the </p><p>hands and the claws,—painful things, that I dare </p><p>not shape too freely. But it is in the subtle graft- </p><p>ing and reshaping one must needs do to the brain </p><p>that my trouble lies. The intelligence is often odd- </p><p>ly low, with unaccountable blank ends, unexpected </p><p>gaps. And least satisfactory of all is something </p><p>that I cannot touch, somewhere—I cannot deter- </p><p>mine where—in the seat of the emotions. Cravings, </p><p>instincts, desires that harm humanity, a strange </p><p>hidden reservoir to burst forth suddenly and inun- </p><p>date the whole being of the creature with anger, </p><p>hate, or fear. These creatures of mine seemed </p><p>strange and uncanny to you so soon as you began </p><p>to observe them; but to me, just after I make them, </p><p>they seem to be indisputably human beings. It’s </p><p>afterwards, as I observe them, that the persuasion </p><p>fades. First one animal trait, then another, creeps </p><p>to the surface and stares out at me. But I will </p><p>conquer yet! Each time I dip a living creature into </p><p>the bath of burning pain, I say, ‘This time I will </p><p>burn out all the animal; this time I will make a </p><p>rational creature of my own!’ After all, what is </p><p>ten years? Men have been a hundred thousand in </p><p>the making.” He thought darkly. “But I am draw- </p><p>ing near the fastness. This puma of mine—” After </p><p>a silence, “And they revert. As soon as my hand</p><p>is taken from them the beast begins to creep back, </p><p>begins to assert itself again.” Another long silence,, </p><p> “Then you take the things you make into those</p><p>dens?” said I. </p><p> “They go. I turn them out when I begin to feel</p><p>the beast in them, and presently they wander there. </p><p>They all dread this house and me. There is a kind </p><p>of travesty of humanity over there. Montgomery </p><p>knows about it, for he interferes in their affairs. </p><p>He has trained one or two of them to our service. </p><p>He’s ashamed of it, but I believe he half likes some </p><p>of those beasts. It’s his business, not mine. They </p><p>only sicken me with a sense of failure. I take no </p><p>iotcrodt in there. I fancy they follow in the lines </p><p>the Kanaka missionary marked out, and have a kind </p><p>of mockery of a rational life, poor beasts! There’s </p><p>something they call the Law. Sing hymns about </p><p>‘all thine.’ They build themselves their dens, </p><p>gathor fruit, and pull herbs—-marry even. But I </p><p>can see through it all, see into their very souls, and </p><p>see there nothing but the souls of beasts, beasts </p><p>that perish, anger and the lusts to live and gratify </p><p>themselves.—Yet they’re odd; complex, like every- </p><p>thing else alive. There is a kind of upward striving </p><p>in them, part vanity, part waste sexual emotion, </p><p>part waste curiosity. It only mocks me. I have </p><p>some hope of that puma. I have worked hard at </p><p>her head and brain— </p><p> “And now,” said he, standing up after a long</p><p>gap of silence, during which we had each pursued </p><p>our own thoughts, “what do you think? Are you </p><p>in fear of me still?” </p><p> I looked at him, and saw but a white-faced, white-</p><p>haired man, with calm eyes. Save for his serenity, </p><p>the touch almost of beauty that resulted from his </p><p>set tranquillity and his magnificent build, he might </p><p>have passed muster among a hundred other com- </p><p>fortable old gentlemen. Then I shivered. By way </p><p>of answer to his second question, I handed him a </p><p>revolver with either hand. </p><p> “Keep them,” he said, and snatched at a yawn.</p><p>He stood up, stared at me for a moment, and smiled. </p><p>“You have had two eventful days,” said he. “I </p><p>should advise some sleep. I’m glad it’s all clear. </p><p>Good-night.” He thought me over for a moment, </p><p>then went out by the inner door. </p><p> I immediately turned the key in the outer one.</p><p>I sat down again; sat for a time in a kind of </p><p>stagnant mood, so weary, emotionally, mentally, </p><p>and physically, that I could not think beyond the </p><p>point at which he had left me. The black window</p><p>stared at me like an eye. At last with an effort I </p><p>put out the light and got into the hammock. Very </p><p>soon I was asleep. </p><p>CHAPTER XV </p><p>Concerning the Beast Folk </p><p>I WOKE early. Moreau’s explanation stood be- </p><p>fore my mind, clear and definite, from the </p><p>moment of my awakening. I got out of the» </p><p>hammock and went to the door to assure myself </p><p>that the key was turned. Then I tried the window- </p><p>bar, and found it firmly fixed. That these man-liko </p><p>creatures were in truth only bestial monsters, mere </p><p>grotesque travesties of men, filled me with a vague </p><p>uncertainty of their possibilities which was far </p><p>worse than any definite fear. </p><p> A tapping came at the door, and I heard the</p><p>glutinous accents of M’ling speaking. I pocketed </p><p>one of the revolvers (keeping one hand upon it), </p><p>and opened to him. </p><p> “Good-morning, sair,” he said, bringing in, in</p><p>addition to the customary herb-breakfast, an ill- </p><p>cooked rabbit. Montgomery followed him. His </p><p>roving eye caught the position of my arm and he </p><p>smiled askew. </p><p> The puma was resting to heal that day; but</p><p>Moreau, who was singularly solitary in his habits, </p><p>did not join us. I talked with Montgomery to clear </p><p>my ideas of the way in which the Beast Folk </p><p>THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU </p><p>lived. In particular, I was urgent to know how </p><p>these inhuman monsters were kept from falling up- </p><p>on Moreau and Montgomery and from rending ono </p><p>another. He explained to me that the comparative </p><p>safety of Moreau and himself was due to the limited </p><p>mental scope of these monsters. In spite of their </p><p>increased intelligence and the tendency of their </p><p>animal instincts to reawaken, they had certain </p><p>fixed ideas implanted by Moreau in their minds, </p><p>which absolutely bounded their imaginations. They </p><p>were really hypnotised; had been told that certain </p><p>things were impossible, and that certain things </p><p>were not to be done, and these prohibitions were </p><p>woven into the texture of their minds beyond any </p><p>possibility of disobedience or dispute. </p><p> Certain matters, however, in which old instinct</p><p>was at war with Moreau's convenience, were in a </p><p>less stable condition. A series of propositions called </p><p>the Law (I had already heard them recited) battled </p><p>in their minds with the deep-seated, ever-rebellious </p><p>cravings of their animal natures. This Law they </p><p>were ever repeating, I found, and ever breaking. </p><p>Both Montgomery and Moreau displayed particular </p><p>solicitude to keep them ignorant of the taste of </p><p>blood; they feared the inevitable suggestion's of </p><p>that flavour. Montgomery told me that the Law, </p><p>especially among the feline Beast People, became </p><p>oddly weakened about nightfall; that then the ani- </p><p>mal was at its strongest; that a spirit of adventure </p><p>sprang up in them at the dusk, when they would </p><p>dare things they never seemed to dream about by </p><p>day. To that I owed my stalking by the Leopard- </p><p>man, on the night of my arrival. But during these </p><p>earlier days of my stay they broke the Law only </p><p>furtively and after dark; in the daylight there was </p><p>a general atmosphere of respect for its multifarious </p><p>prohibitions. </p><p> And here perhaps I may give a few general facts</p><p>about the island and the Beast People. The island, </p><p>which was of irregular outline and lay low upon the </p><p>wide sea, had a total area, I suppose, of seven or </p><p>eight square miles.1 It was volcanic in origin, and </p><p>was now fringed on three sides by coral reefs; some </p><p>fumaroles to the northward, and a hot spring, </p><p>were the only vestiges of the forces that had long </p><p>since originated it. Now and then a faint quiver </p><p>of earthquake would be sensible, and sometimes the </p><p>ascent of the spire of smoke would be rendered </p><p>tumultuous by gusts of steam; but that was all. </p><p>The population of the island, Montgomery informed </p><p>me, now numbered rather more than sixty of these </p><p>strange creations of Moreau’s art, not counting </p><p>the smaller monstrosities which lived in the under- </p><p>growth and were without human form. Altogether </p><p>he had made nearly a hundred and twenty; but</p><p>many had died, and others—like the writhing </p><p>Footless Thing of which he had told me—had come </p><p>by violent ends. In answer to my question, Mont- </p><p>gomery said that they actually bore offspring, but </p><p>that these generally died. When they lived, Moreau </p><p>took them and stamped the human form upon </p><p>them. There was no evidence of the inheritance of </p><p>their acquired human characteristics. The females </p><p>were less numerous than the males, and liable to </p><p>much furtive persecution in spite of the monogamy </p><p>the Law enjoined. </p><p> It would be impossible for me to describe these</p><p> 'This description corresponds in every respect to Noble’s Isle—</p><p>Beast People in detail; my eye has had no training </p><p>in details, and unhappily I cannot sketch. Most </p><p>striking, perhaps, in their general appearance was </p><p>the disproportion between the legs of these crea- </p><p>tures and the length of their bodies; and yet— </p><p>so relative is our idea of grace—my eye became </p><p>habituated to their forms, and at last I even fell </p><p>in with their persuasion that my own long thighs </p><p>were ungainly. Another point was the forward </p><p>carriage of the head, and the clumsy and inhuman </p><p>curvature of the spine. Even the Ape-man lacked </p><p>that inward sinuous curve of the back which makes </p><p>the human figure so graceful. Most had their </p><p>shoulders hunched clumsily, and their short fore- </p><p>arms hung weakly at their sides. Few of them </p><p>were conspicuously hairy, at least until the end </p><p>of my time upon the island. </p><p> The next most obvious deformity was in their</p><p>faces, almost all of which were prognathous, mal- </p><p>formed about the ears, with large and protuberant </p><p>noses, very furry or very bristly hair, and often </p><p>strangely-coloured or strangely-placed eyes. None </p><p>could laugh, though the Ape-man had a chattering </p><p>titter. Beyond these general characters their heads </p><p>had little in common; each preserved the quality of </p><p>its particular species: the human mark distorted </p><p>but did not hide the leopard, the ox, or the sow, or </p><p>other animal or animals, from which the creature </p><p>had been moulded. The voices, too, varied exceed- </p><p>ingly. The hands were always malformed; and </p><p>though some surprised me by their unexpected </p><p>human appearance, almost all were deficient in the </p><p>number of the digits, clumsy about the finger-nails, </p><p>and lacking any tactile sensibility. </p><p> The two most formidable Animal Men were my</p><p>Leopard-man and a creature made of hyena and </p><p>swine. Larger than these were the three bull- </p><p>creatures who rowed in the boat. Then came the </p><p>silvery-hairy-man, who was also the Sayer of the </p><p>Law, M’ling, and a satyr-like creature of ape and</p><p>goat. There were three Swine-men and a Swine- </p><p>woman, a mare-rhinoceros-creature, and several </p><p>other females whose sources I did not ascertain. </p><p>There were several wolf-creatures, a bear-bull, and </p><p>a Saint-Bernard-man. I have already described </p><p>the Ape-man, and there was a particularly hateful </p><p>(and evil-smelling) old woman made of vixen and </p><p>bear, whom I hated from the beginning. She was </p><p>said to be a passionate votary of the Law. Smaller </p><p>creatures were certain dappled youths and my little </p><p>sloth-creature. But enough of this catalogue. </p><p> At first I had a shivering horror of the brutes,</p><p>felt all too keenly that they were still brutes; but </p><p>insensibly I became a little habituated to the idea </p><p>of them, and moreover I was affected by Mont- </p><p>gomery’s attitude towards them. He had been </p><p>with them so long that he had come to regard them </p><p>as almost normal human beings. His London days </p><p>seemed a glorious, impossible past to him. Only </p><p>once in a year 01* so did he go to Africa to deal with </p><p>Moreau’s agent, a trader in animals there. He </p><p>hardly met the finest type of mankind in that sea- </p><p>faring village of Spanish mongrels. The men </p><p>aboard-ship, he told me, seemed at first as strange </p><p>to him as the Beast Men seemed to me,—unnaturally </p><p>long in the leg, fiat in the face, prominent in the </p><p>forehead, suspicious, dangerous, and coldhearted. </p><p>708 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>In fact, he did not like men; his heart had warmed </p><p>to me, he thought, because he had saved my life. </p><p>I fancied even then that he had a sneaking kindness </p><p>for some of these metamorphosed brutes, a vicious </p><p>sympathy with some of their ways, but that he at- </p><p>tempted to veil it from me at first. </p><p> M’ling, the black-face man, Montgomery’s at-</p><p>tendant, the first of the Beast Folk I had encount- </p><p>ered, did not live with the others across the island, </p><p>but in a small kennel at the back of the enclosure, </p><p>The creature was scarcely so intelligent as the Ape- </p><p>man, but far more docile, and the most human- </p><p>looking of all the Beast Folk; and Montgomery had </p><p>trained it to prepare food, and indeed to discharge </p><p>all the trivial domestic offices that were required. </p><p>It was a complex trophy of Moreau’s horrible skill, v </p><p>—a bear, tainted with dog and ox, and one of the </p><p>most elaborately made of all his creatures. It treat- </p><p>ed Montgomery with a strange tenderness and de- </p><p>votion. Sometimes he would notice it, pat it, call </p><p>it half-mocking, half-jocular names, and so make it </p><p>caper with extraordinary delight ^sometimes hewould </p><p>ill-treat it, especially after he had been at the </p><p>whisky, kicking it, beating it, pelting it with stones </p><p>or lighted fusees. But whether he treated it well or </p><p>ill, it loved nothing so much as to be near him. </p><p> I say I became habituated to the Beast People,</p><p>that a thousand things which had seemed unnatural </p><p>and repulsive speedily became natural and ordinary </p><p>to me. I suppose everything in existence takes its; </p><p>colour from the average hue of its surroundings. </p><p>Montgomery and Moreau were too peculiar and in-^ </p><p>dividual to keep my general impressions of human- </p><p>ity well defined. I would see one of the clumsy </p><p>bovine-creatures who worked the launch, treading </p><p>heavily through the undergrowth, and find myself </p><p>asking, trying hard to recall, how he differed from) </p><p>some really human yokel trudging home from his </p><p>mechanical labours; or I would meet the Fox-bear </p><p>woman’s vulpine, shifty face, strangely human in </p><p>its speculative cunning, and even imagine I had </p><p>met it before in some city byway. </p><p> Yet every now and then the beast would flash</p><p>out upon me beyond doubt or denial. An ugly- </p><p>looking man, a hunch-baclced human savage to all ap-v </p><p>pearance, squatting in the aperture of one of the*' </p><p>dens, would stretch his arms and yawn, showing with </p><p>startling suddenness scissor-edged incisors anc] </p><p>sabre-like canines, keen and brilliant as knives. Or </p><p>in some narrow pathway, glancing with a transitory</p><p>daring into the eyes of some lithe, white-swathed </p><p>female figure, I would suddenly see (with a spasmo- </p><p>dic revulsion) that she had slit-like pupils, or glanc- </p><p>ing down ^iote the curving nail with which she held </p><p>her shapeless wrap about her. It is a curious thing, </p><p>by the bye, for which I am quite unable to account, </p><p>that these weird creatures—the females, I mean- </p><p>had in the earlier days of my stay an instinctive </p><p>sense of their own repulsive clumsiness, and dis- </p><p>played in consequence a more than human regard </p><p>for the decency and decorum of extensive costume. </p><p>CHAPTER XVI </p><p>How the Beast Folk Taste Blood </p><p>Y inexperience as a writer betrays mg, and </p><p>I wander from the thread of my story. </p><p>After I had breakfasted with Mont- </p><p>gomery, he took me across the island to see the </p><p>fumarole and the source of the hot spring into </p><p>whose scalding waters I had blundered on the pre- </p><p>vious day. Both of us carried whips and loaded </p><p>revolvers. While going through a leafy jungle on </p><p>our road thither, we heard a rabbit squealing. We </p><p>■stopped and listened, but we heard no more; and </p><p>presently we went on our way, and the incident </p><p>dropped out of our minds. Montgomery called </p><p>my attention to certain little pink animals </p><p>with long hind-legs, that went leaping through </p><p>the undergrowth. He told me they were creatures </p><p>made of the offspring of the Beast People, that Mor- </p><p>eau had invented. He had fancied they might serve </p><p>for meat, but a rabbit-like habit of devouring their </p><p>young had defeated this intention. I had already </p><p>encountered some of these creatures,—once during </p><p>my moonlight flight from the Leopard-man, and once </p><p>during my pursuit by Moreau on the previous day. </p><p>By chance, one hopping to avoid us leapt into the </p><p>hole caused by the uprooting of a wind-blown tree; </p><p>before it could extricate itself we managed to catch </p><p>it. It spat like a cat, scratched and kicked vigor- </p><p>ously with its hind-legs, and made an attempt to </p><p>bite; but its teeth were too feeble to inflict more </p><p>than a painless pinch. It seemed to me rather a </p><p>pretty little creature; and as Montgomery stated </p><p>that it never destroyed the turf by burrowing, and </p><p>was very cleanly in its habits, I should imagine it </p><p>might prove a convenient substitute for the com- </p><p>/mon rabbit in gentlemen’s parks. </p><p> We also saw on our way the trunk of a tree</p><p> barked in long strips and splintered deeply. Mont-</p><p> gomery called my attentions to this. “Not to claw</p><p> bark of trees, that is the Law,” he said. “Much</p><p> some of them care for it!” It was after this, I</p><p> think, that we met the Satyr and the Ape-man.</p><p> The Satyr was a gleam of classical memory on the</p><p> part of Moreau,—his face bovine in expression, like</p><p> the coaser Hebrew type; his voice a harsh bleat,</p><p> his nether extremities Satanic. He was gnawing</p><p> the husk of a pod-like fruit as he passed us. Both</p><p> 'of them saluted Montgomery.</p><p> “Hail,” said they, “to the Other with the Whip.”</p><p> “There’s a Third with a Whip now,” said Mont-</p><p> gomery. “So you’d better mind!”</p><p> “Was he not made?” said the Ape-man. “He said</p><p> —he said he was made.”</p><p> Tho Satyr-man looked curiously at me. "The</p><p> Third with the Whip, he that walks weeping into</p><p> the sea, has a thin white face.”</p><p> f “He has a thin long whip,” said Montgomery,</p><p> f “Yesterday he bled and wept,” said the Satyr.</p><p> “You never bleed nor weep. The Master does not</p><p> bleed or weep.”</p><p> “Ollendorffian beggar!” said Montgomery, “you’ll</p><p> bleed and weep if you don’t look out!”</p><p> “He has five fingers, he is a five-man like me,”</p><p> said the Ape-man.</p><p> “Come along, Prendick,” said Montgomery, tak-</p><p> ing my arm; and I went on with him.</p><p> The Satyr and the Ape-man stood watching us</p><p> and making other remarks to each other.</p><p> “He says nothing,” said the Satyr. “Men have</p><p> voices.”</p><p> “Yesterday he asked me of things to eat,” said</p><p> the Ape-man. “He did not know.”</p><p>THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU </p><p>70? </p><p> Then they spoke inaudible things, and I heard</p><p>the Satyr laughing. </p><p> It was on our way back that we came upon the</p><p>dead rabbit. The red body of the wretched little </p><p>beast was rent to pieces, many of the ribs stripped </p><p>white, and the backbone indisputably gnawed. </p><p> At that Montgomery stopped. “Good God!” said</p><p>he, stooping down, and picking up some of the </p><p>crushed vertebras to examine them more closed. </p><p>“Good God!” he repeated, “what can this mean?” </p><p>“Some carnivore of yours has remembered its </p><p>old habits,” I said after a pause. “This backbone </p><p>has been bitten through.” </p><p> He stood staring, with his face white and his</p><p>lip pulled askew. “I don’t like this,” he said slowly. </p><p> “I saw something of the same kind,” said I,</p><p>“the first day I came here.” </p><p> “The devil you did! What was it?”</p><p> “A rabbit with its head twisted off.”</p><p> “The day you came here?”</p><p> “The day I came here. In the undergrowth at</p><p>the back of the enclosure, when I went out in the </p><p>evening. The head was completely wrung off.” </p><p>He gave a long, low whistle. </p><p> “And what is more, I have an idea which of</p><p>your brutes did the thing. It’s only a suspicion, </p><p>you know. Before I came on the rabbit I saw one </p><p>of your monsters drinking in the stream.” </p><p>“Sucking his drink?” </p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “ ‘Not to suck your drink; that is the Law.' Much</p><p>the brutes care for the Law, eh? when Moreau’s not </p><p>about!” </p><p> “It was the brute who chased me.”</p><p> “Of course,” said Montgomery; “it’s just the</p><p>way with carnivores. After a kill, they drink. It's </p><p>the taste of blood, you know.—What was the brute </p><p>like ?” he continued. “Would you know him again ?” </p><p>He glanced about us, standing astride over the mess </p><p>of dead rabbit, his eyes roving among the shadows </p><p>and screens of greenery, the lurking-places and </p><p>ambuscades of the forest that bounded us in. “The</p><p>taste of blood,” he said again. </p><p> He took out his revolver, examined the cart-</p><p>ridges in it and replaced it. Then he began to </p><p>pull at his dropping lip. </p><p> “I think I should know the brute again,” I said.</p><p>“I stunned him. He ought to have a handsome </p><p>bruise on the forehead of him.” </p><p> “But then we have to prove that he killed the</p><p>rabbit,” said Montgomery. “I wish I’d never </p><p>brought the things here.” </p><p> I should have gone on, but he stayed there think-</p><p>ing over the mangled rabbit in a puzzle-headed way. </p><p>As it was, I went to such a distance that the rab- </p><p>bit’s remains were hidden. </p><p> “Come on!” I said.</p><p> Presently he woke up and came towards me.</p><p>“You see,” he said, almost in a whisper, “they are </p><p>all supposed to have a fixed idea against eating </p><p>anything that runs on land. If some brute has by </p><p>any accident tasted blood—”He went on some way </p><p>in silence. “I wonder what can have happened,” </p><p>he said to himself. Then, after a pause again; “I </p><p>did a foolish thing the other day. That servant </p><p>of mine—I showed him how to skin and cook a </p><p>rabbit. It's odd—I saw him licking his hands— </p><p>It never occurred to me.” Then, “We must put ai </p><p>stop to this. I must tell Moreau.” </p><p> He could think of nothing else on our homeward</p><p>journey. </p><p> Moreau took the matter even more seriously than</p><p>Montgomery, and I need scarcely say that I was </p><p>affected by their evident consternation. </p><p> “We must make an example,” said Moreau. “I've</p><p>no doubt in my own mind that the Leopard-man </p><p>was the sinner. But how can we prove it. I wish, </p><p>Montgomery, you had kept your taste for meat in </p><p>hand, and gone without these exciting novelties. </p><p>We may find ourselves in a mess yet, through it.” </p><p>“I was a silly ass,” said Montgomery. “But the </p><p>thing’s done now; and you said I might have them, </p><p>you know.”- </p><p> “We must see to the thing at once,” said Moreau.</p><p>“I suppose if anything should turn up, M'ling can </p><p>take care of himself?” </p><p> “I’m not so sure of M’ling,” said Montgomery.</p><p>“I thing I ought to know him.”</p><p> In the afternoon, Moreau, Montgomery, myself,</p><p>and M’ling went across the island to the huts in </p><p>the ravine. We three were armed; M’ling carried </p><p>the little hatchet he used in chopping firewood, and </p><p>some coils of wire. Moreau had a huge cowherd’s </p><p>horn slung over his shoulder. </p><p> "You will see a gathering of the Beast People,”</p><p>said Montgomery. “It is a pretty sight!” </p><p> Moreau said not a word on the way, but the ex-</p><p>pression of his heavy, white-fringed face was grim- </p><p>ly set. </p><p> We crossed the ravine down which smoked the</p><p>stream of hot water, and followed the winding path- </p><p>way through the canebrakes until we reached a wide </p><p>area covered over with a thick, powdery yellow sub- </p><p>stance which I believe was sulphur. Above the </p><p>shoulder of a weedy bank the sea glittered. We </p><p>came to a kind of shallow natural amphitheatre, and </p><p>here the four of us halted. Then Moreau sounded </p><p>the horn, and broke the sleeping stillness of the </p><p>tropical afternoom, He must have had strong lungs. </p><p>The hooting note rose and rose amidst its echoes, </p><p>to at last an ear-penetrating intensity. </p><p> “Ah!” said Moreau, letting the curved instrument</p><p>fall to his side again. </p><p> Immediately there was a crashing through the</p><p>yellow canes, and a sound of voices from the dense </p><p>green jungle that marked the morass through </p><p>which I had run on the previous day. Then at three </p><p>or four points on the edge of the sulphurous area </p><p>appeared the grotesque forms of the Beast People </p><p>hurrying towards us. I could not help a creeping </p><p>horror, as I perceived first one and then another trot </p><p>out from the trees or reeds and come shambling </p><p>along over the hot dust. But Moreau and Mont- </p><p>gomery stood calmly enough; and, perforce, I stuck </p><p>beside them. </p><p> First to arrive was the Satyr, strangely unreal</p><p>for all that he cast a shadow and tossed the dust </p><p>with his hoofs. After him from the brake came </p><p>a monstrous lout, a thing of horse and rhinoceros, </p><p>chewing a straw as it came; then appeared the </p><p>Swine-woman and two Wolf-women; then the Fox- </p><p>bear witch, with her red eyes in her peaked red </p><p>face, and then others,—all hurrying eagerly. As </p><p>they came forward they began to cringe towards </p><p>710 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> Moreau and chant, quite regardless of one another,</p><p> fragments of the latter half of the litany of the</p><p> Law,—“Ilis is the Hand that wounds; His is the</p><p> Hand that heals,” and so forth. As soon as they had</p><p> approached within a distance of perhaps thirty</p><p> yards they halted, and bowing on knees and elbows</p><p> began flinging the white dust upon their heads.</p><p> Imagine the scene if you can! We three blue-</p><p> clad men, with our misshapen black-faced attendant,</p><p> standing in a wide expanse of sunlit yellow dust</p><p> under the blazing blue sky, and surrounded by this</p><p> circle of crouching and gesticulating monstrosities,</p><p> —some almost human save in their subtle expres-</p><p> sion and gestures, some like cripples, some so</p><p> strangely distorted as to resemble nothing but the</p><p> denizens of our wildest dreams; and, beyond, the</p><p> reedy lines of a canebrake in one direction, a dense</p><p> tangle of palm-trees on the other, separating us</p><p> from the ravine with the huts, and to the north the</p><p> hazy horizon of the Pacific Ocean.</p><p> “Sixty-two, sixty-three,” counted Moreau. “There</p><p> are four more.”</p><p> “I do not see the Leopard-man,” said I.</p><p> Presently Moreau sounded the great horn again,</p><p> and at the sound of it all the Beast People writhed</p><p> and grovelled in the dust. Then, slinking out of</p><p> the canebrake, stooping near the ground and trying</p><p> to join the dust-throwing circle behind Moreau’s</p><p> back, came the Leopard-man. The last of the Beast</p><p> People to arrive was the little Ape-man. The earlier</p><p> animals, hot and weary with their grovelling, shot</p><p> vicious glances at him.</p><p> “Cease!” said Moreau, in his firm, loud voice; and</p><p> the Beast People sat back upon their hams and</p><p> rested from their worshipping.</p><p> “Where is the Sayer of the Law?” said Moreau,</p><p> and the hairy-grey monster bowed his face in the</p><p> dust.</p><p> “Say the words!” said Moreau.</p><p> Forthwith all in the kneeling assembly, swaying</p><p> from side to side and dashing up the sulphur with</p><p> their hands,—first the right hand and a puff of</p><p> dust, and then the left,—began once more to chant</p><p> their strange litany. When they reached, “Not to</p><p> eat Flesh or Fowl, that is the Law,” Moreau held</p><p> up his lank white hand.</p><p> “Stop!" he cried, and there fell absolute silence</p><p> upon them all.</p><p> I think they all knew and dreaded what was</p><p> coming. I looked round at their strange faces.</p><p> When I saw their wincing attitudes and the furtive</p><p> dread in their bright eyes, I wondered that I had</p><p> ever believed them to be men.</p><p> “That Law has been broken!” said Moreau.</p><p> I “None escape,” from the faceless creature with</p><p> the silvery hair. “None escape,” repeated the kneel-</p><p> ing circle of Beast People.</p><p> “Who is he?” cried Moreau, and looked round at</p><p> their faces, cracking his whip. I fancied the Hyena-</p><p> swine looked dejected, so too did the Leopard-man.</p><p> Moreau stopped, facing this creature, who cringed</p><p> towards him with the memory and dread of infinite</p><p> torment. “Who is he?” repeated Moreau, in a voice</p><p> of thunder.</p><p> “Evil is he who breaks the Law,” chanted the</p><p> Sayer of the Law.</p><p> Moreau looked into the eyes of the Leopard-man,</p><p> and seemed to be dragging the very soul out of the</p><p> creature.</p><p> “Who breaks the Law—” said Moreau, taking</p><p>his eyes off his victim, and turning toward us (it </p><p>seemed to me there was a touch of exultation in his </p><p>voice). </p><p> “Goes back to the House of Pain,” they all clam-</p><p>oured,—“goes back to the House of Pain, 0 Mas- </p><p>ter!” </p><p> “Back to the House of Pain,—back to the House</p><p>of Pain,” gabbled the Ape-man, as though the idea </p><p>was sweet to him. </p><p> “Do you hear?” said Moreau, turning back to</p><p>the criminal, “my friend—Hullo!” </p><p> For the Leopard-man, released from Moreau’s</p><p>eye, had risen straight from his knees, and now, </p><p>with eyes aflame and his huge feline tusks flashing </p><p>out from under his curling lips, leapt towards his </p><p>tormentor. I am convinced that only the madness </p><p>of unendurable fear could have prompted this at- </p><p>tack. The whole circle of threescore monsters </p><p>seemed to rise about us. I drew my revolver. The </p><p>two figures collided. I saw Moreau reeling back </p><p>from the Leopard-man’s blow. There was a furious </p><p>yelling and howling all about us. Every one was</p><p>moving rapidly. For a moment I thought it was a </p><p>general revolt. The furious face of the Leopard- </p><p>man flashed by mine, with M’ling close in pursuit. </p><p>I saw the yellow eyes of the Hyena-swine blazing </p><p>with excitement, his attitude as if he were half re- </p><p>solved to attack me. The Satyr, too, glared at me </p><p>over the Hyena-swine’s hunched shoulders. I heard </p><p>the crack of Moreau’s pistol, and saw the pink flash </p><p>dart across the tumult. The whole crowd seemed </p><p>to swing round in the direction of the glint of fire, </p><p>and I too was swung round by the magnetism of </p><p>the movement. In another second I was running, </p><p>one of a tumultuous shouting crowd, in pursuit of </p><p>the escaping Leopard-man. </p><p> That is all I can tell definitely. I saw the Leo-</p><p>pard-man strike Moreau, and then everything spun </p><p>about me until I was running headlong. M’ling </p><p>was ahead, close in pursuit of the fugitive. Behind, </p><p>their tongues already lolling out, ran the Wolf- </p><p>women in great leaping strides. The Swine folk </p><p>followed, squealing with excitement, and the two </p><p>Bull-men in their swathings of white. Then came </p><p>Moreau in a cluster of the Beast People, his wide- </p><p>brimmed straw hat blown off, his revolver in hand, </p><p>and his lank white hair streaming out. The Hyena- </p><p>swine ran beside me, keeping pace with me and </p><p>glancing furtively at me out of his canine eyes, </p><p>and the others came pattering and shouting behind </p><p>us. </p><p> The Leopard-man went bursting his way through</p><p>the long canes, which sprang back as he passed, </p><p>and rattled in M’ling’s face. We others in the rear </p><p>found a trampled path for us when we reached the </p><p>brake. The chase lay through the brake for per- </p><p>haps a quarter of a mile, and then plunged into a </p><p>dense thicket, which retarded our movements ex- </p><p>ceedingly, though we went through it in a crowd </p><p>together,—fronds flicking into our faces, ropy </p><p>creepers catching us under the chin or gripping our </p><p>ankles, thorny plants hooking into and tearing cloth </p><p>and flesh together. </p><p>THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU </p><p> “He has gone on all-fours through this,” panted</p><p>Moreau, now just ahead of me. </p><p> “None escape,” said the Wolf-bear, laughing into</p><p>my face with the exultation of hunting. </p><p> We burst out again among rocks, and saw the</p><p>quarry ahead running lightly on all-fours and snarl- </p><p>ing at us over his shoulder. At that the Wolf Folk </p><p>howled with delight. The Thing was still clothed, </p><p>and at a distance its face still seemed human; but </p><p>the carriage of its four limbs was feline, and the </p><p>furtive droop of its shoulder was distinctly that of </p><p>a hunted animal. It leapt over some thorny yellow- </p><p>flowering bushes, and was hidden. M’ling was half- </p><p>way across the space. </p><p> Most of us now had lost the first speed of the</p><p>chase, and had fallen into a longer and steadier </p><p>stride. I saw as we traversed the open that the </p><p>pursuit was now spreading from a column into a </p><p>line. The Ilyena-swine still ran close to me, watch- </p><p>ing me as it ran, every now and then puckering its </p><p>muzzle with a snarling laugh. At the edge of the </p><p>rocks the Leopard-man, realising that he was mak- </p><p>ing for the projecting cape upon which he had </p><p>stalked me on the night of my arrival, had doubled </p><p>in the undergrowth; but Montgomery had seen the </p><p>manceuvre, and turned him again. So, panting, </p><p>tumbling against rocks, torn by brambles, impeded </p><p>by ferns and reeds, I helped to pursue the Leopard- </p><p>man who had broken the Law, and the Hyena-swine </p><p>ran, laughing savagely, by my side. I staggered on, </p><p>my head reeling and my heart beating against my </p><p>ribs, tired almost to death, and yet not daring to </p><p>lose sight of the chase lest I should be left alone </p><p>with this horrible companion. I staggered on in </p><p>spite of infinite fatigue and the dense heat of the </p><p>tropical afternoon. </p><p> At last the fury of the hunt slackened. We had</p><p>pinned the wretched brute into a corner of the </p><p>island. Moreau, whip in hand, marshalled us all </p><p>into an irregular line, and we advanced now slowly, </p><p>shouting to one another as we advanced and tight- </p><p>ening the cordon about our victim. He lurked </p><p>noiseless and invisible in the bushes through which </p><p>I had run from him during that midnight pursuit. </p><p> “Steady!” cried Moreau, “steady!” as the ends</p><p>of the line crept round the tangle of undergrowth </p><p>and hemmed the brute in. </p><p> “Ware a rush!” came the voice of Montgomery</p><p>from beyond the thicket. </p><p> I was on the slope above the bushes; Montgomery</p><p>and Moreau beat along the beach beneath. Slowly </p><p>we pushed in among the fretted network of branches </p><p>and leaves. The quarry was silent. </p><p> “Back to the House of Pain, the House of Pain,</p><p>the House of Pain!” yelped the voice of the Ape- </p><p>man, some twenty yards to the right. </p><p> When I heard that, I forgave the poor wretch all</p><p>the fear he had inspired in me. I heard the twigs </p><p>snap and the boughs swish aside before the heavy </p><p>tread of the Horse-rhinoceros upon my right. Then </p><p>suddenly through a polygon of green, in the half </p><p>darkness under the luxuriant growth, I saw the </p><p>creature we were hunting. I halted. He was </p><p>crouched together into the smallest possible com- </p><p>pass, his luminous green eyes turned over his </p><p>shoulder regarding me. </p><p> It may seem a strange contradiction in me,—I</p><p>cannot explain the fact,—but now, seeing the crea- </p><p>ture there in a perfectly animal attitude, with the </p><p>light gleaming in its eyes and its imperfectly human </p><p>face distorted with terror, I realised again the fact </p><p>of its humanity. In another moment other of its </p><p>pursuers would see it, and it would be overpowered </p><p>and captured, to experience once more the horrible </p><p>tortures of the enclosure. Abruptly I slipped out </p><p>my revolver, aimed between its terror-struck eyes, </p><p>and fired. As I did so, the Hyena-swine saw tho </p><p>Thing, and flung itself upon it with an eager cry, </p><p>thrusting thirsty teeth into its neck. All about me </p><p>the green masses of the thicket were swaying and </p><p>cracking as the Beast People came rushing to- </p><p>gether. One face and then another appeared. </p><p> “Don’t kill it, Prendick!” cried Moreau. “Don’t</p><p>kill it!” and I saw him stooping as he pushed </p><p>through under the fronds of the big ferns. </p><p> In another moment he had beaten off the Hyena-</p><p>swine with the handle of his whip, and he and </p><p>Montgomery were keeping away the excited carni- </p><p>vorous Beast People, and particularly M’ling, from! </p><p>the still quivering body. The hairy-grey Thing </p><p>came sniffing at the corpse under my arms. Tho </p><p>other animals, in their animal ardour, jostled me to </p><p>get a nearer view. </p><p> “Confound you, Prendick!” said Moreau. “I</p><p>wanted him.” </p><p> “I’m sorry,” said I, though I was not. “It was</p><p>the impulse of the moment.” I felt sick with exer- </p><p>tion and excitement. Turning, I pushed my way out </p><p>of the crowding Beast People and went on alone up </p><p>the slope towards the higher part of the headland.</p><p>Under the shouted directions of Moreau I heard the </p><p>three white-swathed Bull-men begin dragging the </p><p>victim down towards the water. </p><p> It was easy now for me to be alone. The Beast</p><p>People manifested a quite human curiosity about </p><p>the dead body, and followed it in a thick knot; sniff- </p><p>ing and growling at it as the Bull-men dragged it </p><p>down the beach. I went to the headland and watch- </p><p>ed the Bull-men, black against the evening sky, as </p><p>they carried the weighted dead body out to sea; and </p><p>like a wave across my mind came the realisation of </p><p>the unspeakable aimlessness of things upon the is- </p><p>land. Upon the beach among the rocks beneath me </p><p>were the Ape-man, the Hyena-swine, and several </p><p>other of the Beast People, standing about Mont- </p><p>gomery and Moreau. They were all still intensely </p><p>excited, and all overflowing with noisy expressions </p><p>of their loyalty to the Law; yet I felt an absolute </p><p>assurance in my own mind that the Hyena-swine </p><p>was implicated in the rabbit-killing. A strange per- </p><p>suasion came upon me, that, save for the grossness </p><p>of the line, the grotesqueness of the forms, I had </p><p>here before me the whole balance of human life in </p><p>miniature, the whole interplay of instinct, reason, </p><p>and fate in its simplest form. The Leopard-man had </p><p>happened to go under; that was all the difference. </p><p>Poor brute! </p><p> Poor brutes! I began to see the viler aspect of</p><p>Moreau’s cruelty. I had not thought before of the </p><p>pain and trouble that came to these poor victims </p><p>after they had passed from Moreau’s hands. I had </p><p>shivered only at the days of actual torment in the </p><p>enclosure. But now that seemed to me the lesser </p><p>part. Before, they had been beasts, their instincts </p><p>712 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>fitly adapted to their surroundings, and happy as </p><p>living things may he. Now they stumbled in the </p><p>shackles of humanity, lived in a fear that never </p><p>died, fretted by a law they could not understand; </p><p>their mock-human existence, begun in an agony, </p><p>was one long internal struggle, one long dread of </p><p>Moreau—and for what? It was the wantonness of </p><p>it that stirred me. </p><p> Had Moreau had any intelligible object, I could</p><p>have sympathised at least a little with him. I am </p><p>not so squeamish about pain as that. I could have </p><p>forgiven him a little even, had his motive been only </p><p>hate. But he was so irresponsible, so utterly care- </p><p>less ! His curiosity, his mad, aimless investigations, </p><p>drove him on; and the Things were thrown out to </p><p>live a year or so, to struggle and blunder and suffer, </p><p>and at last to die painfully. They were wretched </p><p>in themselves; the old animal hate moved them to </p><p>trouble one another; the Law held them back from </p><p>a brief hot struggle and a decisive end to their </p><p>natural animosities. </p><p> In those days my fear of the Beast People went</p><p>the way of my personal fear for Moreau. I fell in- </p><p>deed into a morbid state, deep and enduring, and </p><p>alien to fear, which has left permanent scars upon </p><p>my mind. I must confess that I lost faith in the </p><p>sanity of the world when I saw it suffering the pain- </p><p>ful disorder of this island. A blind Fate, a vast </p><p>pitiless Mechanism, seemed to cut and shape the </p><p>fabric of existence; and I, Moreau (by his passion </p><p>for research), Montgomery (by his passion for </p><p>drink), the Beast People with their instincts and </p><p>mental restrictions, were torn and crushed, ruth- </p><p>lessly, inevitably, amid the infinite complexity of </p><p>its incessant wheels. But this condition did not </p><p>come all at once: I think indeed that I anticipate a </p><p>little in speaking of it now. </p><p> CHAPTER XVII</p><p> A Catastrophe</p><p>SCARCELY six weeks passed before I had lost </p><p>every feeling but dislike and abhorrence for </p><p>this infamous experiment of Moreau’s. My </p><p>one idea was to get away from these horrible cari- </p><p>catures of my Maker’s image, back to the sweet and </p><p>wholesome intercourse of men. My fellow-crea- </p><p>tures, from whom I was thus separated, began to </p><p>assume idyllic virtue and beauty in my memory. </p><p>My first friendship with Montgomery did not in- </p><p>crease. His long separation from humanity, his </p><p>secret vice of drunkenness, his evident sympathy </p><p>with thevBeast People, tainted him to me. Several</p><p>times I let him go alone among them. I avoided </p><p>intercourse with them in every possible way. I </p><p>spent an increasing proportion of my time upon the </p><p>beach, looking for some liberating sail that never </p><p>appeared,—until one day there fell upon us an ap- </p><p>palling disaster, which put an altogether different </p><p>aspect upon my strange surroundings. </p><p> It was about seven or eight weeks after my land-</p><p>ing,—rather more, I think, though I had not </p><p>troubled to keep account of the time,—when this </p><p>catastrophe occurred. It happened in the early </p><p>morning—I should think about six. I had risen and </p><p>breakfasted early, having been aroused by the noise </p><p>of three Beast Men carrying wood into the en- </p><p>closure. </p><p> After breakfast I went to the open gateway of</p><p>the enclosure, and stood there smoking a cigarette </p><p>and enjoying the freshness of the early morning. </p><p>Moreau presently came round the corner of the </p><p>enclosure and greeted me. He passed by me, and </p><p>I heard him behind me unlock and enter his labora- </p><p>tory. So indurated was I at that time to the </p><p>abomination of the place, that I heard without a </p><p>touch of emotion the puma victim begin another day </p><p>of torture. It met its persecutor with a shriek, al- </p><p>most exactly like that of an angry virago. </p><p> Then suddenly something happened,—I do not</p><p>know what, to this day. I heard a short, sharp cry </p><p>behind me, a fall, and turning saw an awful face </p><p>rushing upon me,—not human, not animal, but </p><p>hellish, brown, seamed with red branching scars, </p><p>red drops starting out upon it, and the lidless eyes </p><p>ablaze. I threw up my arm to defend myself from </p><p>the blow that flung me headlong with a broken fore- </p><p>arm; and the great monster, swathed in lint and </p><p>with red-stained bandages fluttering about it, leapt </p><p>over me and passed. I rolled over and over down </p><p>the beach, tried to sit up, and collapsed upon my </p><p>broken arm. Then Moreau appeared, his massive </p><p>white face all the more terrible for the blood that </p><p>trickled from his forehead. He carried a revolver </p><p>in one hand. He scarcely glanced at me, but rushed </p><p>off at once in pursuit of the-puma. </p><p> I tried the other arm and sat up. The muffled</p><p>figure In front ran in great striding leaps along the </p><p>beach, and Moreau followed her. She turned her </p><p>head and saw him, then doubling abruptly made for </p><p>the bushes. She gained upon him at every stride. </p><p>I saw her plunge into them, and Moreau, running </p><p>slantingly to intercept her, fired and missed as she </p><p>disappeared. Then he too vanished in the green </p><p>confusion. </p><p> I stared after them, and then the pain in my</p><p>arm flamed up, and with a groan I staggered to my </p><p>feet. Montgomery appeared in the doorway, dressed, </p><p>and with his revolver in his hand. </p><p> “Great God, Prendick!” he said, not noticing</p><p>that I was hurt, “that brute’s loose! Tore the </p><p>fetter out of the wall! Have you seen him?” </p><p>Then sharply, seeing I gripped my arm, “What’s </p><p>the matter?” </p><p> “I was standing in the doorway,” said I.</p><p> He came forward and took my arm. “Blood on</p><p>the sleeve,” said he, and rolled back the flannel. He </p><p>pocketed his weapon, felt my arm about painfully, </p><p>and led me inside. “Your arm is broken,” he said, </p><p>and then, “Tell me exactly how it happened—what </p><p>happened?” </p><p> I told him what I had seen; told him in broken</p><p>sentences, with gasps of pain between them, and </p><p>very dexterously and swiftly he bound my arm </p><p>meanwhile. He slung it from my shoulder, stood </p><p>back and looked at me. </p><p> “You’ll do,” he said. “And now?”</p><p> He thought. Then he went out and locked the</p><p>gates of the enclosure. He was absent some time. </p><p> I was chiefly concerned about my arm. The in*</p><p>cident seemed merely one more of many horrible </p><p>things. I sat down in the deck chair, and I must </p><p>admit swore heartily at the island. The first dull </p><p>feeling of injury in my arm had already given way </p><p>THE ISL'AND OF DR'. MOREAU </p><p>713 </p><p>to a burning pain when Montgomery reappeared. </p><p>His face was rather pale, and he showed more of </p><p>his lower gums than ever. </p><p> “I can neither see nor hear anything of him,” he</p><p>said. “I’ve been thinking .he may want my help.” </p><p>He stared at me with his expressionless eyes. “That </p><p>was a strong brute,” he said. “It simply wrenched </p><p>its fetter out of the wall.” He went to the window, </p><p>then to the door, and there turned to me. “I shall </p><p>go after him,” he said. “There’s another revolver </p><p>I can leave with you. To tell you the truth, I feel </p><p>anxious somehow.” </p><p> He obtained the weapon, and put it ready to my</p><p>hand on the table; then went out, leaving a restless </p><p>contagion in the air. I did not sit long after he </p><p>left, but took the revolver in hand and went to the </p><p>doorway. </p><p> The morning was as still as death. Not a whisper</p><p>of wind was stirring; the sea was like polished </p><p>glass, the sky empty, the beach desolate. In my </p><p>half-excited, half-feverish state, this stillness of </p><p>things oppressed me. I tried to whistle, and the </p><p>tune died away. I swore again,—the second time </p><p>that morning. Then I went to the corner of the </p><p>enclosure and stared inland at the green bush that </p><p>had swallowed up Moreau and Montgomery. When </p><p>would they return, and how? Then far away up the </p><p>beach a little grey Beast Man appeared, ran down </p><p>to the water’s edge and began splashing about. I </p><p>strolled back to the doorway, then to the corner </p><p>again, and so began pacing to and fro like a sentinel </p><p>upon duty. Once I was arrested by the distant </p><p>voice of Montgomery bawling, “Coo-ee— Mor-eau!” </p><p>My arm became less painful, but very hot. I got </p><p>feverish and thirsty. My shadow grew shorter. </p><p>I watched the distant figure until it went away </p><p>again. Would Moreau and Montgomery never re- </p><p>turn? Three sea-birds began fighting for some </p><p>stranded treasure. </p><p> Then from far away behind the enclosure I heard</p><p>a pistol-shot. A long silence, and then came an- </p><p>other. Then a yelling cry nearer, and another dis- </p><p>mal gap of silence. My unfortunate imagination set </p><p>to work to torment me. Then suddenly a shot close </p><p>by. I went to the corner, startled, and saw Mont- </p><p>gomery,—his face scarlet, his hair disordered, and </p><p>the knee of his trousers torn. His face expressed </p><p>profound consternation. Behind him slouched the </p><p>Beast Man, M’ling, and round M’ling’s jaws were </p><p>some queer dark stains. </p><p> “Has he come?” said Montgomery.</p><p> “Moreau?” said I. “No.”</p><p> “My God!” The man was panting, almost sobbing.</p><p>“Go back in,” he said, taking my arm. “They’re </p><p>mad. They’re all rushing about mad. What can </p><p>have happened? I don’t know. I’ll tell you, when </p><p>my breath comes. Where’s some brandy?” </p><p> Montgomery limped before me into the room and</p><p>sat down in the deck chair. M’ling flung himself </p><p>down just outside the doorway and began panting </p><p>like a dog. I got Montgomery some brandy-and- </p><p>water. He sat staring in front of him at nothing, </p><p>recovering his breath. After some minutes he be- </p><p>gan to tell me what had happened. </p><p> He had followed their track for some way. It</p><p>was plain enough at first on account of the crushed </p><p>and broken bushes, white rags torn from the puma's </p><p>bandages, and occasional smears of blood on the </p><p>leaves of the shrubs and undergrowth. He lost </p><p>the track, however, on the stony ground beyond tho </p><p>stream where I had seen the Beast Man drinking, </p><p>and went wandering aimlessly westward shouting </p><p>Moreau's name. Then M’ling had come to him </p><p>carrying a light hatchet. M’ling had seen nothing </p><p>of the puma affair; had been felling wood, and </p><p>heard him calling. They went on shouting together* </p><p>Two Beast Men came crouching and peering at them </p><p>through the undergrowth, with gestures and a fur- </p><p>tive carriage that alarmed Montgomery by their </p><p>strangeness. He hailed them, and they fled guiltily. </p><p>He stopped shouting after that and after wander- </p><p>ing some time farther in an undecided way, deter- </p><p>mined to visit the huts. </p><p> He found the ravine deserted.</p><p> Growing more alarmed every minute, he began</p><p>to retrace his steps. Then it was he encountered </p><p>the two Swine-rmen I had seen dancing on the night </p><p>of my arrival; bloodstained they were about the </p><p>mouth, and intensely excited. They came crashing </p><p>through the ferns, and stopped with fierce faces </p><p>when they saw him. He cracked his whip in some </p><p>trepidation, and forthwith they rushed at him. </p><p>Never before had a Beast Man dared to do that. </p><p>One he shot through the head; M’ling flung himself </p><p>upon the other, and the two rolled grappling. M’ling </p><p>got his brute under and with his teeth in its throat, </p><p>and Montgomery shot that too as it struggled in </p><p>M’ling’s grip. He had some difficulty in inducing </p><p>M’ling to come on with him. Thence they had hur- </p><p>ried back to me. On the way, M’ling had suddenly </p><p>rushed into a thicket and driven out an undersized</p><p>Jackal-man, also blood-stained, and lame through </p><p>a wound in the foot. This brute had run a little </p><p>way and then turned savgely at bay, and Mont- </p><p>gomery—with a certain wantonness, I thought—« </p><p>had shot him. </p><p> “What does it all mean?” said I.</p><p> He shook his head, and turned once more to the</p><p>brandy. </p><p>CHAPTER XVIII </p><p>The Finding of Moreau </p><p>WHEN I saw Montgomery swallow a third </p><p>dose of brandy, I took it upon myself to </p><p>interfere. He was already more than half </p><p>fuddled. I told him that some serious thing must </p><p>have happened to Moreau by this time, or he would </p><p>have returned before this, and that it behooved us to </p><p>ascertain what that catastrophe was. Montgomery </p><p>raised some feeble objections, and at last agreed. </p><p>We had some food, and then all three of us started. </p><p> It is possibly due to the tension of my mind at</p><p>the time, but even now that start into the hot still- </p><p>ness of the tropical afternoon is a singularly vivid </p><p>impression. M’ling went first, his shoulder hunched, </p><p>his strange black head moving with quick starts as </p><p>he peered first on this side of the way and then on </p><p>that. He was unarmed; his axe he had dropped </p><p>when he encountered the Swine-man, Teeth were </p><p>his weapons, when it came to fighting. Montgomery </p><p>followed with stumbling footsteps, his hands in his </p><p>pockets, his face downcast; he was in a state of </p><p>muddled sullenness with me on account of the </p><p>714 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>brandy. My left arm was in a sling (it was lucky </p><p>it was my left), and I carried my revolver in my </p><p>right. Soon we traced a narrow path through the </p><p>wild luxuriance of the island, going northwestward; </p><p>and presently M’ling stopped, and became rigid </p><p>with watchfulness. Montgomery almost staggered </p><p>into him, and then stopped too. Then, listening in- </p><p>tently, we heard coming through the trees the sound </p><p>of voices and footsteps approaching us. </p><p> “He is dead,” said a deep, vibrating voice.</p><p> “He is not dead; he is not dead,” jabbered an-</p><p>other. </p><p> “We saw, we saw,” said several voices.</p><p> "HvJAo” suddenly shouted Montgomery, “Ilul-lo,</p><p>there!” </p><p> “Confound you!” said I, and gripped my pistol.</p><p> There was a silence, then a crashing among the</p><p>interlacing vegetation, first here, then there, and </p><p>then half-a-dozen faces appeared,—strange faces, lit </p><p>by a strange light. M’ling made a growling noise </p><p>in his throat. I recognised the Ape-man: I had </p><p>indeed already identified his voice, and two of the </p><p>white-swathed brown-featured creatures I had seen </p><p>in Montgomery’s boat. With these were the two </p><p>dappled brutes and that grey, horribly crooked crea- </p><p>ture who said the Law, with grey hair streaming </p><p>down its cheeks, heavy grey eyebrows, and grey </p><p>locks pouring off from a central parting upon its </p><p>sloping forehead,—a heavy, faceless thing, with </p><p>strange red eyes, looking at us curiously from </p><p>amidst the green. </p><p> For a space no one spoke. Then Montgomery</p><p>hiccoughed, “Who—said he was dead?” </p><p> The Monkey-man looked guiltily at the hair-grey</p><p>Thing. “He is dead,” said this monster. “They </p><p>saw.” </p><p> There was nothing threatening about this detach-</p><p>ment, at any rate. They seemed awe-stricken and </p><p>puzzled. </p><p> “Where is he?” said Montgomery.</p><p> “Beyond,” and the grey creature pointed.</p><p> “Is there a Law now?” asked the Monkey-mari.</p><p>“Is it still to be this and that? Is he dead indeed?”</p><p> “Is there a Law?” repeated the man in white.</p><p>“Is there a Law, thou Other with the Whip?” </p><p> “He is dead,” said the hairy-grey Thing.</p><p> And they all stood watching us.</p><p> “Prendick,” said Montgomery, turning his dull</p><p>eyes to me. “He’s dead, evidently.” </p><p> I had been standing behind him during this</p><p>colloquy. I began to see how things lay with them. </p><p>I suddenly stopped in front of Montgomery and </p><p>lifted up my voice:— </p><p> “Children of the Law,” I said, “he is not dead!”</p><p>M’ling turned his sharp eyes on me. “He has </p><p>changed his shape; he has changed his body,” I </p><p>went on. “For a time you will not see him. He </p><p>is—there,” I pointed upward, “where he can watch </p><p>you. You cannot see him, but he can see you. Fear </p><p>the Law!” </p><p> I looked at them squarely. They flinched.</p><p> “He is great, he is good,” said the Ape-man,</p><p>peering fearfully upward among the dense trees. </p><p> “And the other Thing?” I demanded.</p><p> “The Thing that bled, and ran screaming and</p><p>sobbing,—that is dead too,” said the grey Thing, </p><p>still regarding me. </p><p> “That's well,” grunted Montgomery.</p><p> “The Other with the Whip—” began the grey</p><p>Thing. </p><p> “Well?” said I.</p><p> “Said he was dead.”</p><p> But Montgomery was still sober enough to under-</p><p>stand my motive in denying Moreau’s death. “He </p><p>is not dead,” he said slowly, “not dead at all. No </p><p>more dead than I am.”	i</p><p> “Some,” said I, “have broken the Law: they will</p><p>die. Some have died. Show us now where his old </p><p>body lies,—the body he cast away because he had no </p><p>more need of it.” </p><p> “It is this way, Man who walked in the Sea,”</p><p>said the grey Thing. </p><p> And with these six creatures guiding us, we went</p><p>through the tumult of ferns and creepers and tree- </p><p>stems towards the northwest. Then came a yelling, </p><p>a crashing among the branches, and a little pink </p><p>homunculus rushed by us shrieking. Immediately </p><p>after appeared a feral monster in headlong pursuit, </p><p>blood-bedabbled, who was amongst us almost before </p><p>he could stop his career. The grey Thing leapt </p><p>aside. M’ling, with a snarl, flew at it, and was </p><p>struck aside. Montgomery fired and missed, bowed </p><p>his head, threw up his arm, and turned to run. I </p><p>fired, and the Thing still came on; fired again, point- </p><p>blank, into its ugly face. I saw its features vanish </p><p>in a flash: its face was driven in. Yet it passed me, </p><p>gripped Montgomery, and holding him, fell head- </p><p>long beside him and pulled him sprawling upon it- </p><p>self in its death-agony. </p><p> I found myself alone with M’ling, the dead brute,</p><p>and-the prostrate man. Montgomery raised himself </p><p>slowly and stared in a muddled way at the shattered </p><p>Beast Man beside him. It more than half sobered </p><p>him. He scrambled to his feet. Then I saw the </p><p>grey Thing returning cautiously through the trees. </p><p> “See,” said I, pointing to the dead brute, “is the</p><p>Law not alive ? This came of breaking the Law.” </p><p> He peered at the body. “He sends the Fire that</p><p>kills,” said he, in his deep voice, repeating part of </p><p>the Ritual. The others gathered round and stared </p><p>for a space. </p><p> At last we drew near the westward extremity of</p><p>the island. We came upon the gnawed and mutilated </p><p>body of the puma, its shoulder-bone smashed by a </p><p>bullet, and perhaps twenty yards farther found at </p><p>last what we sought. Moreau lay face downward in </p><p>a trampled space in a canebrake. One hand was&gt; </p><p>almost severed at the wrist, and his silvery hair </p><p>was dabbled in blood. His head had been battered </p><p>in by the fetters of the puma. The broken canes </p><p>beneath him were smeared with blood. His revolver </p><p>we could not find. Montgomery turned him over. </p><p> Resting at intervals, and with the help of the</p><p>seven Beast People (for he was a heavy man), we </p><p>carried Moreau back to the enclosure. The night </p><p>was darkling. Twice we heard unseen creatures </p><p>howling and shrieking past our little band, and </p><p>once the little pink sloth-creature appeared and </p><p>stared at us, and vanished again. But we were not </p><p>attacked again. At the gates of the enclosure our </p><p>company of Beast People left us, M’ling going with </p><p>the rest. We locked ourself in, and then took </p><p>Moreau’s mangled body into the yard and laid it </p><p>upon a pile of brushwood. Then we went into the </p><p>THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU </p><p>715 </p><p>laboratory and put an end to all we found living </p><p>there. </p><p>CHAPTER XIX </p><p>Montgomery’s “Bank Holiday” </p><p>WHEN this was accomplished, and we had </p><p>washed and eaten, Montgomery and I went </p><p>into my little room and seriously discussed </p><p>our position for the first time. It was then near </p><p>midnight. He was almost sober, but greatly dis- </p><p>turbed in his mind. He had been strangely under </p><p>the influence of Moreau's personality: I do not </p><p>think it had ever occurred to him that Moreau could </p><p>die. This disaster was the sudden collapse of the </p><p>habits that had become part of his nature in the ten </p><p>or more monotonous years he had spent on the is- </p><p>land. He talked vaguely, answered my questions </p><p>crookedly, wandered into general questions. </p><p> “This silly ass of a world,” he said; “what a</p><p>muddle it all is! I haven’t had any life. I wonder </p><p>when it’s going to begin. Sixteen years being bul- </p><p>lied by nurses and schoolmasters at their own </p><p>sweet will; five in London grinding hard at med- </p><p>icine, bad food, shabby lodgings, shabby clothes, </p><p>shabby vice, a blunder,—I didn't know any better, </p><p>—and hustled off to this beastly island. Ten years </p><p>here! What’s it all for, Prendick? Are we bubbles </p><p>blown by a baby?” </p><p> It was hard to deal with such ravings. “The thing</p><p>we have to think of now,” said I, “is how to get </p><p>away from this island.” </p><p> “What’s the good of getting away? I’m an out-</p><p>cast. Where am I to join on? It’s all very well </p><p>for you, Prendick. Poor old Moreau! We can’t </p><p>leave him here to have his bones picked. As it is— </p><p>And besides, what will become of the decent part of </p><p>the Beast Folk?” </p><p> “Well,” said I, “that will'do to-morrow. I’ve been</p><p>thinking we might make that brush-wood into a </p><p>pyre and burn his body—and those other things. </p><p>Then what will happen with the Beast Folk?” </p><p> “7 don’t know. I suppose those that were made</p><p>of beasts of prey will make silly asses of them- </p><p>selves sooner or later. We can’t massacre the lot—• </p><p>can we? I suppose that’s what your humanity </p><p>would suggest? But they'll change. They are sure </p><p>to change.” </p><p> He talked thus inconclusively until at last I felt</p><p>my temper going. </p><p> “Damnation!” he exclaimed at some petulance of</p><p>mine; “can’t you see I’m in a worse hole than you </p><p>are?” And he got up, and went for the brandy. </p><p>“Drink!” he said returning, “you logic-chopping, </p><p>chalky-faced saint of an atheist, drink!” </p><p> “Not I,” said I, and sat grimly watching his face</p><p>under the yellow paraffin flare, as he drank himself </p><p>into a garrulous misery. </p><p> I have a memory of infinite tedium. He wandered</p><p>into a maudlin defence of the Beast People and of </p><p>M’ling. M’ling, he said, was the only thing that had </p><p>ever really cared for him. And suddenly an idea </p><p>came to him. </p><p> “I’m damned!” said he, staggering to his feet and</p><p>clutching the brandy bottle. </p><p>By some flash of intuition I knew what it was he </p><p>intended. “You don’t give drink to that beast!” I </p><p>said, rising and facing him. </p><p> “Beast!” said he. “You’re the beast. He takes</p><p>his liquor like a Christian. Come out of the way, </p><p>Prendick!” </p><p> “For God’s sake,” said I.</p><p> “Get—out of the way!” he roared, and suddenly</p><p>whipped out his revolver. </p><p> “Very well,” said I, and stood aside, half-minded</p><p>to fall upon him as he put his hand upon the latch, </p><p>but deterred by the thought of my useless arm. </p><p>“You’ve made a beast of yourself,—to the beasts </p><p>you may go.” </p><p> He flung the doorway open, and stood half facing</p><p>me between the yellow lamp-light and the pallid </p><p>glare of the moon; his eye-sockets were blotches </p><p>of black under his stubbly eye-brows. </p><p> “You’re a solemn prig, Prendick, a silly ass!</p><p>You’re always fearing and fancying. We’re on the </p><p>edge of things. I’m bound to cut my throat to- </p><p>morrow. I’m going to have a damned Bank Holiday </p><p>to-night.” He turned and went out into the moon- </p><p>light. “M’ling!” he cried; “M’ling, old friend!” </p><p> Three dim creatures in the silvery light came</p><p>along the edge of the wan beach,—one a white- </p><p>wrapped creature, the other two blotches of black- </p><p>ness following it. They halted, staring. Then I </p><p>saw M’ling’s hunched shoulders as he came round</p><p>the corner of the house. </p><p> “Drink!” cried Montgomery, “drink, you brutes!</p><p>Drink and be men! Damme, I’m the cleverest. </p><p>Moreau forgot this; this is the last touch. Drink, </p><p>I tell you!” And waving the bottle in his hand he </p><p>started off at a kind of quick trot to the westward, </p><p>M’ling ranging himself between him and the three </p><p>dim creatures who followed. </p><p> I went to the doorway. They were already in-</p><p>distinct in the mist of the moonlight before Mont- </p><p>gomery halted. I saw him administer a dose of </p><p>the raw brandy to M’ling, and saw the five figures </p><p>melt into one vague patch. </p><p> “Sing!” I heard Montgomery shout,—“sing all</p><p>together, ‘Confound olds Prendick!’ That’s right; </p><p>now again, ‘Confound old Prendick!’” </p><p> The black group broke up into five separate fig-</p><p>ures, and wound slowly away from me along the </p><p>band of shining beach. Each went howling at his </p><p>own sweet will, yelping insults at me, or giving </p><p>whatever other vent this new inspiration of brandy </p><p>demanded. Presently I heard Montgomery’s voice </p><p>shouting, “Right turn!” and they passed w'ith their </p><p>shouts and howls into the blackness of the landward </p><p>trees. Slowly, very slowly, they receded into silence. </p><p> The peaceful splendour of the night healed again.</p><p>The moon was now past the meridian and travelling </p><p>down the west. It was at its full, and very bright </p><p>riding through the empty dark sky. The shadow </p><p>of the wall lay, a yard wide and of inky blackness, </p><p>at my feet. The eastward sea was a featureless </p><p>grey, dark and mysterious; and between the sea </p><p>and the shadow the grey sands (of volcanic glass </p><p>and crystals) flashed and shone like a beach of dia- </p><p>monds. Behind me the paraffin lamp flared hot </p><p>and ruddy. </p><p> Then I shut the door, locked it, and went into</p><p>the enclosure where Moreau lay beside his latest </p><p>victims,—the staghounds and the llama and some </p><p>other wretched brutes,—with his massive face calm </p><p>716 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>even after his terrible death, and with the hard </p><p>eyes open, staring at the dead white moon above. </p><p>I sat down upon the edge of the sink, and with </p><p>my eyes upon that ghastly pile of silvery light and </p><p>ominous shadows began to turn over my plans. In </p><p>the morning I would gather some provisions in the </p><p>dingey, and after setting fire to the pyre before me, </p><p>push out into the desolation of the high sea once </p><p>more. I felt that for Montgomery there was no </p><p>help; that he was, in truth, half akin to these </p><p>Beast Folk, unfitted for human kindred. </p><p> I do not know how long I sat there scheming.</p><p>It must have been an hour or so. Then my plan- </p><p>ning was interrupted by the return of Montgomery </p><p>to my neighbourhood. I heard a yelling from many </p><p>throats, a tumult of exultant cries passing down </p><p>towards the beach, whooping and howling, and ex- </p><p>cited shrieks that seemed to come to a stop near </p><p>the water’s edge. The riot rose and fell; I heard </p><p>heavy blows and the splintering smash of wood, </p><p>but it did not trouble me then. A discordant chant- </p><p>ing began. </p><p> My thoughts went back to my means of escape.</p><p>I got up, brought the lamp, and went into a shed </p><p>to look at some kegs I had seen there. Then I </p><p>became interested in the contents of some biscuit- </p><p>tins, and opened one. I saw something out of the </p><p>tail of my eye,—a red figure,—and turned sharply. </p><p> Behind me lay the yard, vividly black-and-white</p><p>in the moonlight, and the pile of wood and faggots </p><p>on which Moreau and his mutilated victims lay, </p><p>one over another. They seemed to be gripping one </p><p>another in one last revengeful grapple. His-wounds </p><p>gaped, black as night, and the blood that had drip- </p><p>ped lay in black patches upon the sand. Then I </p><p>saw, without understanding, the cause of my </p><p>phantom,—a ruddy glow that came and danced and </p><p>went upon the wall opposite. I misinterpreted this, </p><p>fancied it was a reflection of my flickering lamp, </p><p>and turned again to the stores in the shed. I went </p><p>on rummaging among them, as well as a one-armed </p><p>man could, finding this convenient thing and that, </p><p>and putting them aside for to-morrow's launch. My </p><p>movements were slow, and the time passed quickly. </p><p>Insensibly the daylight crept upon me. </p><p> The chanting died down, giving place to a clam-</p><p>our; then it began again, and suddenly broke into </p><p>a tumult. I heard cries of “More! more!” a sound </p><p>like quarrelling, and a sudden wild shriek. The </p><p>quality of the sounds changed so greatly that it ar- </p><p>rested my attention. I went out into the yard and</p><p>listened. Then cutting like a knife across the con- </p><p>fusion came the crack of a revolver. </p><p> I rushed at once through my room to the little</p><p>doorway. As I did so I heard some of the packing- </p><p>cases behind me go sliding down and smash to- </p><p>gether with a clatter of glass on the floor of the </p><p>shed. But I did not heed these. I flung the door </p><p>open and looked out. </p><p> Up the beach by the boathouse a bonfire was</p><p>burning, raining up sparks into the indistinctness </p><p>of the dawn. Around this struggled a mass of </p><p>black figures. I heard Montgomery call my name. </p><p>I began to run at once towards this fire, revolver </p><p>in hand. I saw the pink tongue of Montgomery’s </p><p>pistol lick out out once, close to the ground. He </p><p>was down. I shouted with all my strength and fired </p><p>into the air. I heard some one cry, “The Master!”. </p><p>The knotted black struggle broke into scattering </p><p>units, the fire leapt and sank down. The crowd of </p><p>Beast People fled in sudden panic before me, up </p><p>the beach. In my excitement I fired at their retreat- </p><p>ing backs as they disappeared among the bushes. </p><p>Then I turned to the black heaps upon the ground. </p><p> Montgomery lay on his back, with the hairy-</p><p>grey" Beast-man sprawling across his body. The </p><p>brute was dead, but still gripping Montgomery’s </p><p>throat with its curving claws. Near by lay M’ling </p><p>on his face and quite still, his neck bitten open and </p><p>the upper part of the smashed brandy-bottle in his </p><p>hand. Two other figures lay near the fire,—the </p><p>one motionless, the other groaning fitfully, every </p><p>now and then raising its head slowly, then dropping </p><p>it again. </p><p> I caught hold of the grey man and pulled him off</p><p>Montgomery's body; his claws drew down the torn </p><p>coat reluctantly as I dragged him away. Mont- </p><p>gomery was dark in the face and scarcely breath- </p><p>ing. I splashed sea-water on his face and pillow- </p><p>ed his head on my rolled-up coat. M’ling was dead. </p><p>The wounded creature by the fire—it was a Wolf- </p><p>brute with a bearded grey face—lay, I found, with </p><p>the fore part of its body upon the still glowing </p><p>timber. The wretched thing was injured so dread- </p><p>fully that in mercy I blew its brains out at once. </p><p>The other brute was one of the Bull-men swathed </p><p>in white. He too was dead. The rest of the Beast </p><p>People had vanished from the beach. </p><p> I went to Montgomery again and knelt beside</p><p>him, cursing my ignorance of medicine. The fire </p><p>beside me had sunk down, and only charred beams </p><p>of timber glowing at the central ends and mixed </p><p>with a grey ash of brushwood remained. I won-</p><p>dered casually where Montgomery had got his wood. </p><p>Then I saw that the dawn was upon us. The sky </p><p>had grown brighter, the setting moon was becom- </p><p>ing pale and opaque in the luminous blue of the </p><p>day. The sky to the eastward was rimmed with </p><p>red. </p><p>, Suddenly I heard a thud and a hissing behind me, </p><p>and, looking round, sprang to my feet with a cry of </p><p>horror. Against the warm dawn great tumultuous </p><p>masses of black smoke were boiling up out of the en- </p><p>closure, and through their stormy darkness shot </p><p>flickering threads of blood-red flame. Then the </p><p>thatched roof caught. I saw the curving charge of </p><p>the flames across the sloping straw. A spurt of fire </p><p>jetted from the window of my room. </p><p> I knew at once what had happened. I remembered</p><p>the crash I had heard. When I had rushed out to </p><p>Montgomery’s assistance, I had overturned the </p><p>lamp. </p><p> The hopelessness of saving any of the contents of</p><p>the enclosure stared me in the face. My mind came </p><p>back to my plan of flight, and turning swiftly I </p><p>looked to see where the two boats lay upon the </p><p>beach. They were gone! Two axes lay upon the </p><p>sands beside me; chips and splinters were scattered </p><p>broadcast, and the ashes of the bonfire were black- </p><p>ening and smoking under the dawn. Montgomery </p><p>had burnt the boats to revenge himself upon me </p><p>and prevent our return to mankind! </p><p> A sudden convulsion of rage shook me. I wag</p><p>almost moved to batter his foolish head in, as he </p><p>THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU </p><p>717 </p><p>lay there at my feet. Then suddenly his hand </p><p>moved, so feebly, so pitifully, that my wrath van- </p><p>ished. He groaned, and opened his eyes for a </p><p>minute. I knelt down beside him and raised his </p><p>head. He opened his eyes again, staring silently </p><p>at the dawn, and then they met mine. The lids </p><p>fell. </p><p> “Sorry,” he said presently, with an effort. He</p><p>seemed trying to think. “The last,” he murmured, </p><p>“the last of this silly universe. What a mess—” </p><p> I listened. His head fell helplessly to one side.</p><p>I thought some drink might revive him; but there </p><p>■was neither drink nor vessel in which to bring drink </p><p>at hand. He seemed suddenly heavier. My heart </p><p>went cold. I bent down to his face, put my hand </p><p>through the rent in his blouse. He was dead; </p><p>and even as he died a line of white heat, the limb </p><p>of the sun, rose eastward beyond the projection of </p><p>the bay, splashing its radiance across the sky and </p><p>turning the dark sea into a weltering tumult of </p><p>dazzling light. It fell like a glory upon his death- </p><p>shrunken face. </p><p> I let his head fall gently upon the rough pillow</p><p>I had made for him, and stood up. Before me was </p><p>the glittering desolation of the sea, the awful soli- </p><p>tude from which I had already suffered so much; </p><p>behind me the island, hushed under the dawn, its </p><p>Beast People silent and unseen. The enclosure, </p><p>with all its provisions and ammunition, burnt noisi- </p><p>ly, with sudden gusts of flame, a fitful crackling, </p><p>and now and then a crash. The heavy smoke drove </p><p>up the beach away from me, rolling low over the </p><p>distant tree-tops towards the huts in the ravine. </p><p>Beside me were the charred vestiges of the boats </p><p>and these four dead bodies. </p><p> Then out of the bushes came three Beast People,</p><p>with hunched shoulders, protruding heads, mis- </p><p>shapen hands awkwardly held, and inquisitive, un- </p><p>friendly eyes, and advanced towards me with </p><p>hesitating gestures. </p><p>CHAPTER XX </p><p>Alone with the Beast Folk </p><p>1 FACED these people, facing my fate in them, </p><p>single-handed now,—literally single-handed, </p><p>for I had a broken arm. In my pocket was a re- </p><p>volver with two empty chambers. Among the chips </p><p>scattered about the beach lay the two axes that had </p><p>been used to chop up the boats. The tide was creep- </p><p>ing in behind me. There was nothing for it but</p><p>courage. I looked squarely into the faces of the ad- </p><p>vancing monsters. They avoided my eyes, and their </p><p>quivering nostrils investigated the bodies that lay </p><p>beyond me on the beach. I took half-a-dozen steps, </p><p>picked up the blood-stained whip that lay beneath </p><p>the body of the Wolf-man, and cracked it. They </p><p>stopped and stared at me. </p><p> “Salute!” said I. “Bow down!”</p><p> They hesitated. One bent his knees. I repeated</p><p>my command, with my heart in my mouth, and ad- </p><p>vanced upon them. One knelt, then the other two. </p><p> I turned and walked towards the dead bodies,</p><p>keeping my face towards the three kneeling Beast </p><p>Men, very much as an actor passing up the stage </p><p>faces the audience. </p><p> “They broke the Law,” said I, putting my foot</p><p>on the Sayer of the Law. “They have been slain,— </p><p>even the Sayer of the Law; even the Other with </p><p>the Whip. Great is the Law! Come and see.” </p><p> “None escape,” said one of them, advancing and</p><p>peering. </p><p> “None escape,” said I. “Therefore hear and do</p><p>as I command.” They stood up, looking question- </p><p>ingly at one another. </p><p> “Stand there,” said I.</p><p> I picked up the hatchets and swung them by their</p><p>heads from the sling of my arm; turned Mont- </p><p>gomery over; picked up his revolver still loaded </p><p>in two chambers, and bending down to rummage, </p><p>found half-dozen cartridges in his pocket. </p><p> “Take him,” said I, standing up again and point-</p><p>ing with the whip; “take him, and carry him out </p><p>and cast him into the sea.” </p><p> They came forward, evidently still afraid of Mont-</p><p>gomery, but still more afraid of my cracking red </p><p>whip-lash; and after some fumbling and hesitation, </p><p>some whip-cracking and shouting, they lifted him </p><p>gingerly, carried him down to the beach, and were </p><p>splashing into the dazzling welter of the sea. </p><p> “On!” said I, “on; Carry him far.”</p><p> They went in up to their armpits and stood re-</p><p>garding me. </p><p> “Let go,” said I; and the body of Montgomery</p><p>vanished with a splash. Something seemed to</p><p>tighten across my chest. </p><p> “Good!” said I, with a break in my voice; and</p><p>they came back, hurrying and fearful, to the mar- </p><p>gin of the water, leaving long wakes of black in </p><p>the silver. At the water’s edge they stopped, turn- </p><p>ing and glaring into the sea as though they pres- </p><p>ently expected Montgomery to arise therefrom and </p><p>exact vengeance. </p><p> “Now these,” said I, pointing to the other bodies.</p><p> They took care not to approach the place where</p><p>they had thrown Montgomery into the water, but </p><p>instead, carried the four dead Beast People slant- </p><p>ingly along the beach for perhaps a hundred yards </p><p>before they waded out and cast them away. </p><p> As I watched them disposing of the mangled re-</p><p>mains of M’ling, I heard a light footfall behind </p><p>me, and turning quickly saw the big Hyena-swine </p><p>perhaps a dozen yards away. His head was bent </p><p>down, his bright eyes were fixed upon me, his </p><p>stumpy hands clenched and held close by his side. </p><p>He stopped in his crouching attitude when I turned, </p><p>his eyes a little averted. </p><p> For a moment we stood eye to eye. I dropped the</p><p>whip and snatched at the pistol in my pocket; for </p><p>I meant to kill this brute, the most formidable of </p><p>any left now upon the island, at the first excuse. </p><p>It may seem treacherous, hut so I was resolved. I </p><p>was far more afraid of him than of any other two </p><p>of the Beast Folk. His continued life was I knew </p><p>a threat against mine. </p><p> I was perhaps a dozen seconds collecting myself.</p><p>Then cried I, “Salute! Bow down!” </p><p> His teeth flashed upon me in a snarl. “Who are</p><p>you that I should—” </p><p> Perhaps a little too spasmodically I drew my</p><p>revolver, aimed quickly and fired. I heard him </p><p>yelp, saw him run sideways and turn, knew I had </p><p>missed, and clicked back the cock with my thumb </p><p>for the next shot. But he was already running </p><p>718 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>headlong, jumping from side to side, and I dared </p><p>not risk another miss. Every now and then he </p><p>looked back at me over his shoulder. He went </p><p>slanting along the beach, and vanished beneath the </p><p>driving masses of dense smoke that were still pour- </p><p>ing out from the burning enclosure. For some time </p><p>I stood staring after him. I turned to my three </p><p>obedient Beast Folk again and signalled them to </p><p>drop the body they still carried. Then I went back </p><p>to the place by the fire where the bodies had fallen, </p><p>and kicked the sand until all the brown blood-stains </p><p>were absorbed and hidden. </p><p> I dismissed my three serfs with a wave of the</p><p>hand, and went up the beach into the thickets. I </p><p>carried my pistol in my hand, my whip thrust with </p><p>the hatchets in the sling of my arm. I was anxious </p><p>to be alone, to think out the position in which I </p><p>was now placed. A dreadful thing that I was only </p><p>beginning to realise was, that over all this island </p><p>there was now no safe place where I could be alone </p><p>and secure to rest or sleep. I had recovered strength </p><p>amazingly since my landing, but I was still inclined </p><p>to be nervous and to break down under any great </p><p>stress. I felt that I ought to cross the island and </p><p>establish myself with the Beast People, and make </p><p>myself secure in their confidence. But my heart </p><p>failed me. I went back to the beach, and turning </p><p>eastward past the burning enclosure, made for a </p><p>point where a shallow spit of coral sand ran out </p><p>towards the reef. Here I could sit down and think, </p><p>my back to the sea and my face against any sur- </p><p>prise. And there I sat, chin on knees, the sun beat- </p><p>ing down upon my head and unspeakable dread in </p><p>my mind, plotting how I could live on against the </p><p>hour of my rescue (if ever rescue came). I tried to </p><p>review the whole situation as clamly as I could, </p><p>but it was difficult to clear the thing of emotion. </p><p> I began turning over in my mind the reason of</p><p>Montgomery’s despair. “They will change,” he </p><p>said; “they are sure to change.” And Moreau, </p><p>what was it that Moreau had said? “The stubborn </p><p>beast-flesh grows day by day back again.” Then </p><p>I came round to the Hyena-swine. I felt sure that </p><p>if I did not kill that brute, he would kill me. The </p><p>Sayer of the Law was dead: worse luck. They knew </p><p>now that we of the Whips could be killed even as </p><p>they themselves were killed. Were they peering </p><p>at me already out of the green masses of ferns and </p><p>palms over yonder, watching until I came within </p><p>their spring? Were they plotting against me? </p><p>What was the Hyena-swine telling them? My </p><p>imagination was running away with me into a </p><p>morass of unsubstantial fears.</p><p> My thoughts were disturbed by a crying of sea-</p><p>birds hurrying towards some black object that had </p><p>been stranded by the waves on the beach near the </p><p>enclosure. I knew what that object was, but I had </p><p>not the heart to go back and drive them off.- I be- </p><p>gan walking along the beach in the opposite direc- </p><p>tion, designing to come round the eastward corner </p><p>of the island and so approach the ravine of the </p><p>huts, without traversing the possible ambuscades </p><p>of the thickets. </p><p> Perhaps half a mile along the beach I became</p><p>aware of one of my three Beast Folk advancing </p><p>out of the landward bushes towards me. I was </p><p>now so nervous with my own imaginings that I </p><p>immediately drew my revolver. Even the pro- </p><p>pitiatory gestures of the creature failed to disarm </p><p>me. He hesitated as he approached. </p><p> “Go away!” cried I.</p><p> There was something very suggestive of a dog</p><p>in the cringing attitude of the creature. It re- </p><p>treated a little way, very like a dog being sent </p><p>home, and stopped, looking at me imploringly with </p><p>canine brown eyes. </p><p> “Go away,” said I. “Do not come near me,”</p><p> “May I not come near you?” it said.</p><p> “Nof; go away,” I insisted, and snapped my</p><p>whip. Then putting my whip in my teeth, I stoop- </p><p>ed for a stone, and with that threat drove the </p><p>creature away. </p><p> So in solitude I came round by the ravine of the</p><p>Beast People, and hiding among the weeds and </p><p>reeds that separated this crevice from the sea I </p><p>watched such of them as appeared, trying to judge </p><p>from their gestures and appearance how the </p><p>death of Moreau and Montgomery and the destruc- </p><p>tion of the House of Pain had affected them. I </p><p>know now the folly of my cowardice. Had I kept </p><p>my courage up to the l&lt;?vel of the dawn, had I </p><p>not allowed it to ebb away in solitary thought, I </p><p>might have grasped the vacant sceptre of Moreau </p><p>and ruled over the Beast People. As it was I lost </p><p>the opportunity, and sank to the position of a </p><p>mere leader among my fellows. </p><p> Towards noon certain of them came and squat-</p><p>ted basking in the hot sand. The imperious voices </p><p>of hunger and thirst prevailed over my dread. I </p><p>came out of the bushes, and, revolver in hand,' </p><p>walked down towards these seated figures. One,</p><p>a Wolf-woman, turned her head and stared at me, </p><p>and then the others. None attempted to rise or </p><p>salute me. I felt too faint and weary to insist, and </p><p>I let the moment pass. </p><p> “I want food,” said I, almost apologetically, and</p><p>drawing near. </p><p> “There is food in the huts,” said an Ox-boar-</p><p>man, drowsily, and looking away from me. </p><p> I passed them, and went down into the shadow</p><p>and odours of the almost deserted ravine. In an </p><p>empty hut I feasted on some specked and half- </p><p>decayed fruit; and then after I had propped some </p><p>branches and sticks about the opening, and placed </p><p>myself with my face towards it and my hand up- </p><p>on my revolver, the exhaustion of the last thirty </p><p>hours claimed its own, and I fell into a light </p><p>slumber, hoping that the flimsy barricade I had </p><p>erected v/ould cause sufficient noise in its removal </p><p>to save me from surprise. </p><p>CHAPTER XXI </p><p>The Reversion of the Beast FolK </p><p>IN this way I became one among the Beast </p><p>People in the Island of Doctor Moreau. When </p><p>I awoke, it was dark about me. My arm </p><p>ached in its bandages. I sat up, wondering at first </p><p>where I might be. I heard coarse voices talking </p><p>outside. Then I saw that my barricade had gone, </p><p>and that the opening of the hut stood clear. My </p><p>revolver was still in my hand. </p><p> I heard something breathing, saw something</p><p>crouched together close beside me. I held my </p><p>THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU </p><p>719 </p><p>breath, trying to see what it was. It began to </p><p>move slowly, interminably. Then something soft </p><p>and warm and moist passed across my hand. All </p><p>my muscles contracted. I snatched my hand away. </p><p>A cry of alarm began and was stifled in ray throat. </p><p>Then I just realised what had happened sufficiently </p><p>to stay my fingers on the revolver. </p><p> “Who is that?” I said in a horse whisper, the</p><p>revolver still pointed. </p><p> “I—Master.”</p><p> “Who are you?”</p><p> “They say there is no Master now. But I know,</p><p>I know. I carried the bodies into the sea, 0 </p><p>Walker in the Sea! the bodies of those you slew. </p><p>I am your slave, Master.” </p><p> “Are you the one I met on the beach?” I asked.</p><p> “The same, Master.”</p><p> The Thing was evidently faithful enough, for it</p><p>might have fallen upon me as I slept. “It is well,” </p><p>I said, extending my hand for another licking kiss. </p><p>I began to realise what its presence meant, and </p><p>the tide of my courage flowed. “Where are the </p><p>others?” I asked. </p><p> “They are mad; they are fools,” said the Dog-</p><p>man. “Even now they talk together beyond there. </p><p>They say, ‘The Master is dead. The Other with the </p><p>Whip is dead. That Other who walked in the Sea </p><p>is as we are. We have no Master, no Whips, no- </p><p>House of Pain, any more. There is an end. We </p><p>love the Law, and will keep it; but there is no Pain, </p><p>no Master, no Whips for ever again.’ So they say. </p><p>But I know, Master, I know.” </p><p> I felt in the darkness, and patted the Dog-man’S</p><p>head. “It is well,” I said again. </p><p> “Presently you will slay them all,” said the Dog-</p><p>man. </p><p> “Presently,” I answered, “I will slay them all,—</p><p>after certain days and certain things have come </p><p>to pass. Every one of them save those you spare, </p><p>every one of them shall be slain.” </p><p> “What the Master wishes to kill, the Master</p><p>kills,” said the Dog-man with a certain satisfaction </p><p>in his voice.</p><p> “And that their sins may grow,” I said, “let</p><p>them live in their folly until their time is ripe. Let </p><p>them not know that I am the Master.” </p><p> “The Master’s will is sweet,” said the Dog-man,</p><p>with the ready tact of his canine blood. </p><p> “But one has sinned,” said I. “Him I will kill,</p><p>whenever I may meet him. When I say to you, </p><p>‘That is he,’ see that you fall upon him. And now </p><p>I will go to the men and women who are assembled </p><p>together.” </p><p> For a moment the opening of the hut was black-</p><p>ened by the exit of the Dog-man. Then I followed </p><p>and stood up, almost in the exact spot where I </p><p>had been when I had heard Moreau and his stag- </p><p>hound pursuing me. But now it was night, and </p><p>all the miasmatic ravine about me was black; and </p><p>beyond, instead of a green, sunlit slope, I saw a </p><p>red fire, before which hunched, grotesque figures </p><p>moved to and fro. Farther were the thick trees, </p><p>a bank of darkness, fringed above with the black </p><p>lace of the upper branches. The moon was just </p><p>riding up on the edge of the ravine, and like a </p><p>bar across its face drove the spire of vapour that </p><p>was for ever streaming from the fumaroles of tho </p><p>island. </p><p> “Walk by me,” said I, nerving myself; and side</p><p>by side we walked down the narrow way, taking </p><p>little heed of the dim Things that peered at us out </p><p>of the huts. </p><p> None about the fire attempted to salute me. Most</p><p>of them disregarded me, ostentatiously. I looked </p><p>round for the Hyena-swine, but he was not there. </p><p>Altogether, perhaps twenty of the Beast Folk squat- </p><p>ted, staring into the fire or talking to one another. </p><p> “He is dead, he is dead! the Master is dead!”</p><p>said the voice of the Ape-man to the right of me. </p><p>“The House of Pain—there is no House of Pain!” </p><p> “He is not dead,” said I, in a loud voice.' “Even</p><p>now he watches us!” </p><p> This startled them. Twenty pairs of eyes re-</p><p>garded me. </p><p> “The House of Pain is gone,” said I. “It will</p><p>come again. The Master you cannot see; yet even </p><p>now he listens among you.” </p><p> “True, true!” said the Dog-man.</p><p> They were staggered at my assurance. An ani-</p><p>mal may be ferocious and cunning enough, but it </p><p>takes a real man to tell a lie. </p><p> “The Man with tlie Bandaged Arm speaks a</p><p>strange thing,” said one of the Beast Folk. </p><p> “I tell you it is so,” I said. “The Master and the</p><p>House of Pain will come again. Woe be to him </p><p>who breaks the Law!” </p><p> They looked curiously at one another. With an</p><p>affectation of indifference I began to chop idly at </p><p>the ground in front of me with my hatchet. They </p><p>looked, I noticed, at the deep cuts I made in the </p><p>turf. </p><p> Then the Satyr raised a doubt. I answered him.</p><p>Then one of the dappled things objected, and an </p><p>animated discussion sprang up round the fire. </p><p>Every moment I began to feel more convinced of </p><p>my present security. I talked now without the </p><p>catching in my breath, due to the intensity of my </p><p>excitement, that had troubled me at first. In the </p><p>course of about an hour I had really convinced sev- </p><p>eral of the Beast Folk of the truth of my asser- </p><p>tions, and talked most of the others into a dubious </p><p>state. I kept a sharp eye for my enemy the Hyena- </p><p>swine, but he never appeared. Every now and then </p><p>a suspicious movement would startle me, but my </p><p>confidence grew rapidly. Then as the moon crept </p><p>down from the zenith, one by one the listeners be- </p><p>gan to yaw (showing the oddest teeth in the light </p><p>of the sinldng fire), and first one and then another </p><p>retired towards the dens in the ravine; and I, </p><p>dreading the silence and darkness, went with them, </p><p>knowing I was safer with several of them than </p><p>with one alone. </p><p> In this manner began the longer part of my so-</p><p>journ upon this Island of Doctor Moreau. But </p><p>from that night until the end came, there was but </p><p>one thing happened to tell save a series of innumer- </p><p>able small unpleasant details and the fretting of an </p><p>incessant-uneasiness. So that I prefer to make </p><p>no chronicle for that gap of time, to tell only one </p><p>cardinal incident of the ten months I spent as an </p><p>intimate of these half-humanized brutes. There is </p><p>much that sticks in my memory that I could write, </p><p>—things that I would cheerfully give my right </p><p>720 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>hand to forget; but they do not help the telling of </p><p>the story. </p><p> In the retrospect it is strange to remember how</p><p>soon I fell in with these monsters’ ways, and gained </p><p>my confidence again. I had my quarrels with them </p><p>of course, and could show some of their teeth-mark3 </p><p>still; but they soon gained a wholesome respect for </p><p>my trick of throwing stones and for the bite of </p><p>my hatchet. And my Saint-Bernard-man’s loyalty </p><p>was of infinite service to me. I found their simple </p><p>scale of honour was based mainly on the capacity </p><p>for inflicting trenchant wounds. Indeed, I may </p><p>say—without vanity, I hope—that I held something </p><p>like pre-eminence among them. One or two, whom </p><p>in a rare access of high spirits I had scarred rather </p><p>badly, bore me a grudge; but it vented itself chiefly </p><p>behind my back, and at a safe distance from my </p><p>missiles, in grimaces. </p><p> The Hyena-swine avoided me, and I was always</p><p>on the alert for him. My inseparable Dog-man hated </p><p>and dreaded him intensely. I really believe that </p><p>was at the root of the brute’s attachment to me. </p><p>It was soon evident to me that the former monster </p><p>had tasted blood, and gone the way of the Leopard- </p><p>man. He formed a lair somewhere in the forest, </p><p>and became solitary. Once I tried to induce the </p><p>Beast Folk to hunt him, but I lacked the authority </p><p>to make them co-operate for one end. Again and </p><p>again I tried to approach his den and come upon </p><p>him unaware; but always he was too acute for me, </p><p>and saw 01* winded me and got away. He too made </p><p>-every forest pathway dangerous to me and my ally </p><p>with his lurking ambuscades. The Dog-man scarce- </p><p>ly dared to leave my side. </p><p> In the first month or so the Beast Folk, com-</p><p>pared with their latter condition, were human </p><p>enough, and for one 01* two besides my canine friend </p><p>I even conceived a friendly tolerance. The little </p><p>pink sloth-creature displayed an odd affection for </p><p>me, and took to following me about. The Monkey- </p><p>man bored^ me, however; he assumed, on the </p><p>strength of his five digits, that he was my equal, </p><p>and was forever jabbering at me,—jabbering the </p><p>most arrant nonsense. One thing about him enter- </p><p>tained me a little: he had a fantastic trick of </p><p>coining new words. He had an idea, I believe, that </p><p>to gabble about names that meant nothing was the </p><p>proper use of speech. He called it “Big Thinks” </p><p>to distinguish it from “Little Thinks,” the sane </p><p>every-day interests of life. If ever I made a re- </p><p>mark he did not understand, he would praise it very </p><p>much, ask me to say it again, learn it by heart,</p><p>and go off repeating it, with a word wrong here or </p><p>there, to all the milder of the Beast People. He </p><p>thought nothing of what was plain and comprehen- </p><p>sible. I invented some very curious “Big Thinks” </p><p>for his especial use. I believe now that he was the </p><p>silliest creature I never met; he had developed in </p><p>the most wonderful way the distinctive silliness of </p><p>man without losing one jot of the natural folly </p><p>of a monkey. </p><p> This, I say, was in the earlier weeks of my</p><p>solitude among these brutes. During that time </p><p>they respected the usage established by the Law, </p><p>and behaved with general decorum. Once I found </p><p>another rabbit torn to pieces,—by the Hyena- </p><p>swine, I am assured,—but that was all. It was </p><p> about May when I first distinctly perceived a grow-</p><p>ing difference in their speech and carriage, a grow- </p><p>ing coarseness of articulation, a growing disinclina- </p><p>tion to talk. My Monkey-man’s jabber multiplied </p><p>in volume, but grew less and less comprehensible, </p><p>more and more simian. Some of the others seemed </p><p>altogether slipping their hold upon speech, though </p><p>they still understood what I said to them at that </p><p>time. (Can you imagine language, once clear-cut </p><p>and exact, softening and guttering, losing shape and </p><p>import, becoming mere lumps of sound again?) </p><p>And they walked erect with an increasing difficulty. </p><p>Though they evidently felt ashamed of themselves, </p><p>every now and then I would come upon one or </p><p>another running on toes and finger-tips, and quite </p><p>unable to recover the vertical attitude. They held </p><p>things more clumsily; drinking by suction, feeding </p><p>by gnawing, grew commoner every day. I realised </p><p>more keenly than ever what Moreau had told me </p><p>about the “stubborn beast-flesh.” They were re- </p><p>verting, and reverting very rapidly. </p><p> My Dog-man imperceptibly slipped back to the</p><p>dog again; day by day he became dumb, quad- </p><p>rupedal, hairy. I scarcely noticed the transition </p><p>from the companion on my right hand to the lurch- </p><p>ing dog at my side. </p><p> As the carelessness and disorganisation increased</p><p>from day to day, the lane of dwelling-places, at no </p><p>time very sweet, became so loathsome that I left </p><p>it, and going across the island made myself a hovel </p><p>of boughs amid the black ruins of Moreau’s en- </p><p>closure. Some memory of pain, I found, still made </p><p>that place the safest from the Beast Folk. </p><p> It would be impossible to detail every step of the</p><p>lapsing of these monsters,—to tell how, day by </p><p>day, the human semblance left them; how they </p><p>gave up bandagings and wrappings, abandoned at </p><p>last every stitch of clothing; how the hair began</p><p>to spread over the exposed limbs; how their fore- </p><p>heads fell away and their faces projected; how the </p><p>quasi-human intimacy I had permitted myself with </p><p>some of them in the first month of my loneliness </p><p>became a shuddering horror to recall. </p><p> The change was slow and inevitable. For them</p><p>and for me it came without any definite shock. I </p><p>still went among them in safety, because no jolt </p><p>in the downward glide had released the increasing </p><p>charge of explosive animalism that ousted the </p><p>human day by day. But I began to fear that soon </p><p>now that shock must come. My Saint-Bernard- </p><p>brute followed me to the enclosure every night, and </p><p>his vigilance enabled me to sleep at times in some- </p><p>thing like peace. The little pink sloth-thing became </p><p>shy and left me, to crawl back to its natural life </p><p>once more among the tree-branches. We were in </p><p>just the state of equilibrium that would remain in </p><p>one of those “Happy Family” cages which animal- </p><p>tamers exhibit, if the tamer were to leave it for </p><p>ever. </p><p> Of course these creatures did not decline into</p><p>such beasts as the reader has seen in zoological </p><p>gardens,—into ordinary bears, wolves, tigers, oxen, </p><p>swine, and apes. There was still something strange </p><p>about each; in each Moreau had blended this animal </p><p>with that. One perhaps was ursine chiefly; but </p><p>each was tainted with other creatures,—a kind of </p><p>generalised animalism appearing through tho </p><p>THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU </p><p>721 </p><p> specific dispositions. And the dwindling shreds</p><p>of the humanity still startled me every now and </p><p>then,—a momentary recrudescence of speech per- </p><p>haps, an unexpected dexterity of the fore-feet, a </p><p>pitiful attempt to walk erect. </p><p> I too must have undergone strange changes. My</p><p>clothes hung about me as yellow rags, through </p><p>whose rents showed the tanned skin. My hair grew </p><p>long, and became matted together. I am told that </p><p>even now my eyes have a strange brightness, a </p><p>swift alertness of movement. </p><p> At first I spent the daylight hours on the south-</p><p>ward beach watching for a ship, hoping and pray- </p><p>ing for a ship. I counted on the “Ipecacuanha” re- </p><p>turning as the year wore on; but she never came. </p><p>Five times I saw sails, and thrice smoke; but noth- </p><p>ing ever touched the island. I always had a bon- </p><p>fire ready, but no doubt the volcanic reputation of </p><p>the island was taken to account for that. </p><p> It was only about September or October that I</p><p>began to think of making a raft. By that time </p><p>my arm had healed, and both my hands were at my </p><p>service again. At first, I found my helplessness ap- </p><p>palling. I had never done any carpentry or such- </p><p>like work in my life, and I spent day after day in </p><p>experimental chopping and binding among the </p><p>trees. I had no ropes, and could hit on nothing </p><p>wherewith to make ropes; none of the abundant </p><p>creepers seemed limber or strong enough, and with </p><p>all my litter of scientific education I could not de- </p><p>vise any way of making them so. I spent more </p><p>than a fortnight grubbing among the black ruins of </p><p>the enclosure and on the beach where the boats had </p><p>been burnt, looking for nails and other stray pieces </p><p>of metal that might prove of service. Now and then </p><p>some Beast-creature would watch me, and go leaping </p><p>off when I called to it. There came a season of </p><p>thunder-storms and heavy rain, which greatly re- </p><p>tarded my work; but at last the raft was completed. </p><p> I was delighted with it. But with a certain lack</p><p>of practical sense which has always been my bane, </p><p>I had made it a mile or more from the sea; and be- </p><p>fore I had dragged it down to the beach the thing </p><p>had fallen to pieces. Perhaps it is as well that I </p><p>was saved from launching it; but at the time my </p><p>misery at my failure was so acute that for some </p><p>days I simply moped on the beach, and stared at </p><p>the water and thought of death. </p><p> I did not, however, mean to die, and an incident</p><p>occurred that warned me unmistakably of the folly</p><p>of letting the days pass so,—for each fresh day was </p><p>fraught with increasing danger from the Beast </p><p>People. </p><p> I was lying in the shade of the enclosure wall,</p><p>staring out to sea, when I was startled by something </p><p>cold touching the skin of my heel, and starting </p><p>round found the little pink sloth-creature blinking </p><p>into my face. He had long since lost speech and </p><p>active movement, and the lank hair of the little </p><p>brute grew thicker every day and his stumpy claws </p><p>more askew. He made a moaning noise when he </p><p>saw he had attracted my attention, went a little way </p><p>towards the bushes and looked back at me. </p><p> At first I did not understand, but1 presently it</p><p>occurred to me that he wished me to follow him; </p><p>and this I did at last,—slowly, for the day was hot. </p><p>When we reached the trees he clambered into them, </p><p> for he could travel better among their swinging</p><p>creepers than on the ground. And suddenly in a </p><p>trampled space I came upon a ghastly group. My </p><p>Saint-Bernard-creature lay on the ground, dead; </p><p>and near his body crouched the Hyena-swine, grip- </p><p>ping the quivering flesh with its misshapen claws, </p><p>gnawing at it, and snarling with delight. As I ap- </p><p>proached, the monster lifted its glaring eyes to </p><p>mine, its lips went trembling back from its red- </p><p>stained teeth, and it growled menacingly. It was </p><p>not afraid and not ashamed; the last vestige of the </p><p>human taint had vanished. I advanced a step </p><p>farther, stopped, and pulled out my revolver. At </p><p>last I had him face to face. </p><p> The brute made no sign of retreat; but its ears</p><p>went back, its hair bristled, and its body crouched </p><p>together. I aimed between the eyes and fired. As </p><p>I did so, the Thing rose straight at mo in a leap, </p><p>and I was knocked over like a ninepin. It clutched </p><p>at me with its crippled hand, and struck me in the </p><p>face. Its spring carried it over me. I fell under </p><p>the hind part of its body; but luckily I had hit </p><p>as I meant, and it had died even as it leapt. I </p><p>crawled out from under its unclean weight and </p><p>stood up trembling, staring at its quivering body. </p><p>That danger at least was over; but this, I knew, </p><p>was only the first of the series of relapses that </p><p>must come. </p><p> I burnt both of the bodies on a pyre of brush-</p><p>wood; but after that I saw that unless I left the </p><p>island my death was only a question of time. The </p><p>Beast People by that time had, with one or two </p><p>exceptions, left the ravine and made themselves </p><p>lairs according to their taste among the thickets </p><p>of the island. Few prowled by day, most of them </p><p>slept, and the island might have seemed deserted</p><p>to a new-comer; but at night the air was hideous </p><p>with their calls and howling. I had half a mind </p><p>to make a massacre of them; to build traps, or </p><p>fight them with my knife. Had I possessed sufficient </p><p>cartridges, I should not have hesitated to begin the </p><p>killing. There could now be scarcely a score left </p><p>of the dangerous carnivores; the braver of these </p><p>were already dead. After the death of this poor </p><p>dog of mine, my last friend, I too adopted to some </p><p>extent the practice of slumbering in the daytime in </p><p>order to be on my guard at night. I rebuilt my den </p><p>in the walls of the enclosure, with such a narrow </p><p>opening that anything attempting to enter must </p><p>necessarily make a considerable noise. The crea- </p><p>tures had lost the art of fire too, and recovered </p><p>their fear of it. I turned once more, almost pas- </p><p>sionately now, to hammering together stakes and </p><p>branches to form a raft for my escape. </p><p> I	found a thousand difficulties. I am an ex-</p><p>tremely unhandy man (my schooling was over be- </p><p>fore the days of Slojd); but most of the require- </p><p>ments of a raft I met at last in some clumsy, cir- </p><p>cuitous way or other, and this time I took care of </p><p>the strength. The only insurmountable obstacle </p><p>was that I had no vessel to contain the water I </p><p>should need if I floated forth upon these untravelled </p><p>seas. I would have even tried pottery, but the is- </p><p>land contained no clay. I used to go moping about </p><p>the island, trying with all my might to solve this </p><p>one last difficulty. Sometimes I would give way to </p><p>wild outbursts of rage, and hack and splinter some </p><p>722 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>Unlucky tree in my intolerable vexation. But I </p><p>could think of nothing. </p><p> And then came a day, a wonderful day, which</p><p>I spent in ecstasy. I saw a sail to the southwest, </p><p>a small sail like that of a little schooner; and forth- </p><p>with I lit a great pile of brushwood, and stood by it </p><p>in the heat of it, and the heat of the midday sun, </p><p>watching. All day I watched that sail, eating or </p><p>drinking nothing, so that my head reeled; and the </p><p>Beasts came and glared at me, and seemed to won- </p><p>der, and went away. It was still distant when night </p><p>came and swallowed it up; and all night I toiled, to </p><p>keep my blaze bright and high, and the eyes of the </p><p>Beasts shone out of the darkness, marvelling. In </p><p>the dawn the sail was nearer, and I saw it was the </p><p>dirty lug-sail of a small boat. But it sailed strange- </p><p>ly. My eyes were weary with watching, and I </p><p>peered and could not believe them. Two men were </p><p>in the boat, sitting low down,—one by the bows, </p><p>the other at the rudder. The head was not kept to </p><p>the wind; it yawed and fell away. </p><p> As the day grew brighter, I began waving the</p><p>last rag of my jacket to them; but they did not </p><p>notice me, and sat still, facing each other, I went </p><p>to the lowest point of the low headland, and gesti- </p><p>culated and shouted. There was no response, and </p><p>the boat kept on her aimless course, making slowly, </p><p>very slowly, for the bay. Suddenly a great white </p><p>bird flew up out of the boat, and neither of the men </p><p>stirred nor noticed it; it circled round, and then </p><p>came sweeping overhead with its strong wings out- </p><p>spread. </p><p> Then I stopped shouting, and sat down on the</p><p>headland and rested my chin on my hands and </p><p>stared. Slowly, slowly, the boat drove past towards </p><p>the west. I would have swum out to it, but some- </p><p>thing—a cold, vague fear—kept me back, and left </p><p>it a hundred yards or so to the westward of the </p><p>ruins of the enclosure. The men in it were dead, </p><p>had been dead so long that they fell to pieces when </p><p>I. tilted the boat on its side and dragged them out. </p><p>One had a shock of red hair, like the captain of </p><p>the “Ipecacuanha,” and a dirty white cap lay in the </p><p>bottom of the boat. </p><p> As I stood beside the boat, three of the Beasts</p><p>came slinking out of the bushes and sniffing towards </p><p>me. One of my spasms of disgust came upon me. </p><p>I thrust the little boat down the beach and clam- </p><p>bered on board her. Two of the brutes were Wolf- </p><p>beasts, and came forward with quivering nostrils </p><p>and glittering eyes; the third was the horrible</p><p>nondescript of bear and bull.J When I saw them </p><p>approaching those wretched remains, heard them </p><p>snarling at one another and caught the gleam of </p><p>their teeth, a frantic horror succeeded my repulsion. </p><p>I turned my back upon them, struck the lug and </p><p>began paddling out to sea. I could not bring my- </p><p>self to look behind me. </p><p> I lay, however, between the reef and the island</p><p>that night, and the next morning went round to </p><p>the stream and filled the empty keg aboard with </p><p>water. Then, with such patience as I could com- </p><p>mand, I collected a quantity of fruit, and waylaid </p><p>and killed two rabbits with my last three cartridges. </p><p>While I was doing this I left the boat moored to </p><p>an inward projection of the reef, for fear of the </p><p>Beast People. </p><p>CHAPTER XXII </p><p>The Man Alone </p><p>IN the evening I started, and drove out to sea </p><p>before a gentle w'ind from the southwest, </p><p>slowly, steadily; and the island grew smaller </p><p>and smaller, and the lank spire of smoke dwindled </p><p>to a finer and finer line against the hot sunset. The </p><p>ocean rose up around me, hiding that low, dark </p><p>patch from my eyes. The daylight, the trailing </p><p>glory of the sun, went streaming out of the sky, </p><p>was drawn aside like some luminous curtain, and </p><p>at last I looked into the blue gulf of immensity </p><p>which the sunshine hides, and saw the floating </p><p>hosts of the stars. The sea was silent, the sky </p><p>was silent. I was alone with the night and silence. </p><p> So I drifted for three days, eating and drinking</p><p>sparingly, and meditating upon all that had hap- </p><p>pened to me,—not desiring very greatly then to see </p><p>men again. One unclean rag was about me, my </p><p>hair a black tangle: no doubt my discoverers thought </p><p>me a madman. </p><p> It is strange, but I felt no desire to return to</p><p>mankind. I was only glad to be quit of the foul- </p><p>ness of the Beast People. And on the third day I </p><p>was picked up by a brig from Apia to San Fran- </p><p>cisco. Neither the captain nor the mate would be- </p><p>lieve my story, judging that solitude and danger </p><p>had made me mad; and fearing their opinion might </p><p>be that of others, I refrained from telling my ad- </p><p>venture further, and professed to recall nothing </p><p>that had happened to me between the loss of the </p><p>“Lady Vain” and the time when I was picked up </p><p>again,—the space of a year. </p><p> I had to act with the utmost circumspection to</p><p>save myself from the suspicion of insanity. My</p><p>memory of the Law, of the two dead sailors, of the </p><p>ambuscades of the darkness, of the body in the cane- </p><p>brake, haunted me; and, unnatural as it seems, </p><p>with my return to mankind came, instead of that </p><p>confidence and sympathy I had expected, a strange </p><p>enhancement of the uncertainty and dread I had </p><p>experienced during my stay upon the island. No </p><p>one would believe me; I was almost as queer to </p><p>men as I had been to the Beast People. I may have </p><p>caught something of the natural wildness of my </p><p>companions. They say that terror is a disease, and </p><p>anyhow I can witness that for several years now a </p><p>restless fear has dwelt in my mind,—such a rest- </p><p>less fear as a half-tamed lion cub may feel. </p><p> My trouble took the strangest form. I could not</p><p>persuade myself that the men and women I met </p><p>were not also another Beast People, animals half </p><p>wrought into the outward image of human souls, </p><p>and that they would presently begin to revert,^ </p><p>to show first this bestial mark and then that. But </p><p>I have confided my case to a strangely able man,— </p><p>a man who had known Moreau, and seemed half to </p><p>credit my story; a mental specialist,—and he has </p><p>helped me mightily, though I do not expect that </p><p>the terror of that island will ever altogether leave </p><p>me. At most times it lies far in the back of my </p><p>mind, a mere distant cloud, a memory, and a faint </p><p>distrust; but there are times when the little cloud </p><p>spreads until it obscures the whole sky. Then I </p><p>look about me at my fellow-men; and I go in fear. </p><p>I see faces, keen and bright; others, dull or dan- </p><p>gerous; others, unsteady, insincere,—pono </p><p>THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU </p><p>723. </p><p>have the calm authority of a reasonable soul. I </p><p>feel as though the animal was surging up through </p><p>them; that presently the degradation of the Is- </p><p>landers will be played over again on a larger scale. </p><p>I know this is an illusion; that these seeming men </p><p>and women about me are indeed men and women,— </p><p>men and women for ever, perfectly reasonable </p><p>creatures, full of human desires and tender solici- </p><p>tude, emancipated from instinct and the slaves of </p><p>no fantastic Law,—beings altogether different from </p><p>the Beast Folk. Yet I shrink from them, from their </p><p>curious glances, their inquiries and assistance, and </p><p>long to be away from them and alone. For that </p><p>reason I live near the broad free downland, and can </p><p>escape thither when this shadow is over my soul; </p><p>and very sweet is the empty downland then, under </p><p>the wind-swept sky. </p><p> When I lived in London the horror was well-nigh</p><p>insupportable. I could not get away from men: </p><p>their voices came through windows; locked doors </p><p>were flimsy safeguards. I would go out into the </p><p>streets to fight with my delusion, and prowling wo- </p><p>men would mew after me; furtive, craving men </p><p>glance jealously at me; weary, pale workers go </p><p>coughing by me with tired eyes and eager paces, </p><p>like wounded deer dripping blood; old people, bent </p><p>and dull, pass murmuring to themselves; and, all </p><p>unheeding, a ragged tail of gibing children. Then </p><p>I would turn aside into some chapel,—and even </p><p>there, such was my disturbance, it seemed that the </p><p>preacher gibbered “Big Thinks,” even as the Ape- </p><p>man had done; or into some library, and there the </p><p>intent faces over the books seemed but patient </p><p>creatures waiting for prey. Particularly nauseous </p><p>were the blank, expressionless faces of people in </p><p>trains and omnibuses; they seemed no more mtf </p><p>fellow-creatures than dead bodies would be, so that </p><p>I did not dare to travel unless I was assured of </p><p>being alone. And even it seemed that I too was not </p><p>a reasonable creature, but only an animal tormented </p><p>with some strange disorder in its brain which sent </p><p>it to wander alone, like a sheep stricken with gid. </p><p> This is a mood, however, that comes to me now,</p><p>I thank God, more rarely. I have withdrawn my- </p><p>self from the confusion of cities and multitudes, </p><p>and spend my days surrounded by wise books,—^ </p><p>bright windows in this life of ours, lit by the shin* </p><p>ing souls of men. I see few strangers, and have </p><p>but a small household. My days I devote to reading </p><p>and to experiments in chemistry, and I spend many </p><p>of the clear nights in the study of astronomy. </p><p>There is—though I do not know how there is or</p><p>why there is—a sense of infinite peace and protec- </p><p>tion in the glittering hosts of heaven. There it must </p><p>be, I think, in the vast and eternal laws of matter, </p><p>and not in the daily cares and sins and troubles </p><p>of men, that whatever is more than animal within </p><p>us must find its solace and its hope. I hope, or I </p><p>could not live. </p><p> And so, in hope and solitude, my story ends.</p><p>Edward Prendick, </p><p>NOTE. </p><p> The substance of the chapter entitled, “Doctor</p><p>Moreau explains,” which contains the essential idea </p><p>of the story, appeared as a middle article in the </p><p>"Saturday Review” in January, 1895.

HYATT VERILL</p><p>CHAPTER VI </p><p>F the inhabitants of this country, which </p><p>I now feel sure is a continent or an im- </p><p>mense island in the unexplored area </p><p>beyond the south pole, I might write </p><p>many pages. But this manuscript must </p><p>not be too long, for even written as it is on this </p><p>wonderfully thin and light material, yet I must </p><p>have a care that it is not too heavy for the winged </p><p>messenger to whom I intend to entrust it. </p><p> I have already described, to the best of my ability,</p><p>the personal or physical appearance of the strange </p><p>beings among whom, I fear, I am destined to remain </p><p>for the rest of my life. Also, I have spoken of </p><p>their means of communicating with one another and </p><p>with myself, and here and there I have given short </p><p>accounts of their habits and occupations and of </p><p>their wonderful inventions and accomplishments. </p><p>But as yet, I have said nothing of their social or </p><p>family life, their thoughts, laws, codes, public in- </p><p>stitutions and many other matters which have </p><p>proved vastly interesting to me, and may perhaps </p><p>interest my fellow men if Fate wills that this manu- </p><p>script ever reaches them. </p><p>There is so much to__</p><p>write that is strange, in- </p><p>credible and difficult to </p><p>describe, that I hardly </p><p>know where to begin. </p><p>Many long months passed </p><p>before I could carry on </p><p>a thought conversation </p><p>clearly enough to get an </p><p>insight into many mat- </p><p>ters ; but now that I have </p><p>been here for over a </p><p>year, as nearly as I can </p><p>figure it out, I am able to make myself understood </p><p>and to understand them as readily as if we spoke </p><p>a common language. </p><p> First perhaps, I should mention that these crea-</p><p>tures are comparatively short lived. They seldom </p><p>reach an age which in my world would be forty </p><p>years, but as they mature in an incredibly short </p><p>time their lives are proportionately as long as our </p><p>own. That is, these creatures become fully grown </p><p>and with fully developed powers, both mentally and </p><p> IN the concluding installment we find our explorer cn-</p><p> meshed deeply in the talons—or should we say claws—</p><p> of the crustacean civilisation.

Will the lobster-like creat-</p><p> ures stay beyond the pole, or will they, perhaps, overrun</p><p> the other habited part of the earth? All of this, of course,</p><p> you zvill find out as you go on reading the tale with</p><p> breathless interest.

Moreover, their mental and </p><p>physical powers remain unimpaired until death, and </p><p>age, as we know it, does not exist. Thus their full </p><p>span of life is made available for their utmost en- </p><p>deavors. I have spoken of them as hatching from </p><p>eggs and this was to me a most astounding thing </p><p>when I discovered it But after all it should not </p><p>have surprised me, for being crustacean-like, there </p><p>is no reason why they should not have crustacean- </p><p>like traits of development and life. The eggs aro </p><p>deposited in places provided for the purposes and </p><p>are there carefully watched over by beings whose </p><p>lives are devoted to the purpose, and the young, </p><p>when they emerge from the eggs, are separated </p><p>into groups, each group or collection being destined</p><p>for training, or I might say development, for special </p><p>purposes. Thus one group will be destined for </p><p>miners, another for chemists, others for artizans </p><p>and so on. And the number of young selected for </p><p>_ each group is decided </p><p>by the demands for the </p><p>specific trades or pro- </p><p>fessions for which they </p><p>are destined. Thus, if </p><p>there are a normal num- </p><p>ber. of healthy and able </p><p>bodied miners and no </p><p>necessity for more, none </p><p>of the young of that </p><p>particular time will be </p><p>destined for that trade, </p><p>whereas, if there are </p><p>say two thousand artizans needed that many </p><p>young will be set apart for development as artizans. </p><p>Also, if the number of eggs exceeds the number </p><p>which the rulers deem necessary, the surplus are </p><p>destroyed before the young emerge. This is a mat- </p><p>ter determined by calculations as to the number of </p><p>beings who are expected to die during the year, </p><p>and the number of inhabitants who can be safely </p><p>permitted to exist without danger of want or im- </p><p>proper accommodations. As a result, there is no </p><p>725 </p><p>726 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>poverty, no want, no idleness and no suffering in </p><p>the entire country and no surplus or lack of any </p><p>trade or profession. To me it seemed a most bar- </p><p>barous and inhuman practice at first, but after all </p><p>they are not human. And in many ways it is a most </p><p>admirable idea and I cannot help comparing the </p><p>extraordinary well-being and universal content of </p><p>these creatures with the dissatisfaction, poverty </p><p>and suffering of the human race. Moreover, there </p><p>is no sickness or illness among them. Any member </p><p>injured or ill is at once done away with, for, so </p><p>they argue, to cure a sick or injured being neces- </p><p>sitates the services of one or more others, even if </p><p>the ill or injured creature survives and recovers, </p><p>whereas, should he or she remain a cripple or unfit </p><p>for duty, he or she is an impediment and may re- </p><p>quire the constant services of others, as well as </p><p>the sustenance and support which might be better </p><p>devoted to healthy, perfect individuals. It may </p><p>seem a merciless system, but these beings have no </p><p>sentiment, affection or love as we know them. </p><p> Their entire lives are devoted to the well being</p><p>of the whole community and to performing the </p><p>duties alloted them. But I do not mean by that </p><p>they are lacking in pleasures or recreations or are </p><p>ceaseless workers like the ants. They realize that </p><p>ceaseless labor drains their powers and that change </p><p>is a necessity, and their hours of work and recrea- </p><p>tion are regulated. But their recreations are to </p><p>me most strange. They consist largely of frolick- </p><p>ing in the water, like genuine water creatures, or </p><p>of racing madly about in a sort of dance until utter- </p><p>ly exhausted. Also, they have queer games and </p><p>athletic contests, and in these they are often so </p><p>seriously injured as to result in their being done </p><p>away with. Not that the loss of a limb or of sev- </p><p>eral limbs amounts to much for these creatures can </p><p>lose nearly all their exterior organs and be none </p><p>the worse after a few weeks, for like lobsters and </p><p>crabs, they grow new limbs or appendages readily, </p><p>and after shedding their skins or shells, appear as </p><p>whole as ever. This shedding process was of course </p><p>an astounding thing to me at first, though quite </p><p>natural, but it was, I am told, one of the greatest </p><p>drawbacks to their development and well-being and </p><p>in years long past was a terrific problem to solve. </p><p>In those days thousands of the creatures shed their </p><p>old skins at the same time, and for days thereafter, </p><p>were soft, tender, almost helpless and unfit for </p><p>duty, and thus the entire nation was at a standstill </p><p>and was exposed to the attacks of their enemies,— </p><p>the giant ants and other creatures. Gradually, how- </p><p>ever, by changing diet and regulating the develop- </p><p>ment of eggs and young, the creatures managed to</p><p>produce a race whose members did not shed all at </p><p>once, but cast off their shells at various seasons, so </p><p>that only a portion of their numbers were helpless </p><p>at one time. Moreover, they found that garments </p><p>or coverings could be devised to protect their tender </p><p>bodies and permit them to perform certain duties. </p><p> Of course, though it was amazing to me at first,</p><p>there are no real family ties and no such things as </p><p>love or marriage. The males and females perform </p><p>equal work and are on perfect equality and merely </p><p>mate at the call of nature for the purpose of pro- </p><p>pagating the race. At one time, I understand, the </p><p>beings mated for life and reared their own eggs and </p><p>young, but the females gradually rebelled at being </p><p>forced to take no part in the industries and being </p><p>compelled to devote their time to domestic duties, </p><p>and tfye rulers, finding that the race was dying out </p><p>through neglect of eggs and young; and that count- </p><p>less numbers of the dissatisfied females produced </p><p>no offspring, were compelled to accede to the fe- </p><p>males' demands and take over all eggs and young </p><p>as government wards. This soon led to the females </p><p>refusing to mate for any considerable length of </p><p>time, and gradually all family relations were done </p><p>away with. Also, this led to the necessity of the </p><p>government predetermining the life and occupation </p><p>of each young individual, and of destroying thou- </p><p>sands of eggs each Season. In the old days the </p><p>young of an artizan or a miner became miners or </p><p>artizans and inherited many of their parents’ traits, </p><p>while the fact that the females were obliged to </p><p>rear their own young resulted in limited numbers </p><p>of progeny. But with the new order of things it was </p><p>impossible to say who were the parents of the ac- </p><p>cumulated eggs, and released from all care the </p><p>females produced far greater numbers of eggs than </p><p>could be raised without overcrowding the country. </p><p> Also, I am told, the females in former times were</p><p>quite distinct from the males both in physical and </p><p>mental characters. They were smaller, weaker and </p><p>more delicate and were quiet, docile and somewhat </p><p>affectionate. But now I find that it is with the </p><p>utmost difficulty'that the two sexes can be distin- </p><p>guished and that if anything, the females are the </p><p>larger, stronger and more hardy of the two. In- </p><p>deed, I was amazed to find that most of the soldiers </p><p>or police, as well as many of the miners and laborers </p><p>were females, and, so I was told, whatever troubles </p><p>01* dissensions had arisen were always caused by </p><p>the aggressive females. </p><p> Indeed, I was informed confidentially that the</p><p>rulers had decided to limit the number of females </p><p>and were surreptitiously destroying all female </p><p>young not absolutely necessary for the propagation</p><p>of the race. This was a most difficult matter, for </p><p>several members of the government were females </p><p>and they were anxious to increase the numbers of </p><p>their sex until all power should be in female hands. </p><p>To destroy a young creature after it had emerged </p><p>from the egg unless it is malformed, is a most </p><p>serious crime and hitherto no one had been able to </p><p>distinguish a male from a female egg. But, so I </p><p>was told, one of the greatest chemists or scientists </p><p>had discovered a means of determining the egg sex </p><p>and fortunately this scientist was a male. The </p><p>secret had been assiduously kept from reaching the </p><p>females and so when eggs were to be destroyed the </p><p>males could select the female eggs for destruction. </p><p> Another rather astounding trait that I discovered</p><p>was that these creatures are stone deaf when their </p><p>skins are first slied and that their ears are quite </p><p>useless until they have placed small pebbles within </p><p>them. </p><p> Whether the presence of these stones enables</p><p>them to communicate with one another, and with </p><p>me, without sounds, I cannot say, but it is such </p><p>a remarkable habit that I feel sure it must have </p><p>some bearing on the matter” (See foot note by Dr. </p><p>Lyman)1. </p><p>1 (Foot note by Dr. Lyman) </p><p> It 13 apparent tliat Mr. Bishop’s studies along the lines of science</p><p>BEYOND THE POLE </p><p> This habit and their habit of shedding led to a</p><p>most amusing incident soon after my arrival in this </p><p>place. Feeling in need of a bath I made my way </p><p>to the lake, and disrobing, plunged into the water. </p><p>As I emerged I found a group of the creatures </p><p>gathered about my ragged clothing and examining </p><p>the garments with the greatest interest and evident </p><p>excitement. Then they insisted upon feeling of </p><p>my naked body and expressed the greatest amaze- </p><p>ment that I had changed so greatly in appearance. </p><p>But they were still more amazed when I again put </p><p>on my clothes. Then one of the beings brought </p><p>several pebbles which he—with kindly intentions </p><p>no doubt—tried to insert in my ears. It was with </p><p>the greatest difficulty that I prevented this and </p><p>when the creatures found that I could hear without </p><p>the bits of stone they were absolutely dumbfounded. </p><p>Neither could they understand—and cannot to this </p><p>day—why I should not be able to remain under </p><p>water for hours and crawl about on the bottom as </p><p>they do. </p><p> But to return to their lives and habits. The</p><p>government, as I have called it, is not like anything </p><p>on our part of the earth. There are to be sure </p><p>certain members of the race to whom I have re- </p><p>ferred as rulers, but they are not rulers in the </p><p>ordinary sense. The goverment, if such it may be </p><p>called, consists of a great number of individuals </p><p>chosen by the inhabitants to perform certain duties. </p><p> Thus one lot had charge of the eggs, another</p><p>regulates the production of metal, another looks </p><p>after the food supplies, another has charge of the </p><p>buildings and so on. Each community appoints a </p><p>certain number of the members of each of these </p><p>groups, and those appointed cannot do anything nor </p><p>make any rules or decisions without the knowledge </p><p>and consent of the communities from which they </p><p>are appointed. </p><p> Moreover, as these regulators or committeemen,</p><p>as I may call them, are reared from the eggs with </p><p>the sole purpose of fulfilling such duties, they have </p><p>no other objects or purposes in life and carry out </p><p>their duties honestly and to the best of their abili- </p><p>ties. </p><p> Each one is delegated to his post for life, and</p><p>if he or she fails to carry out his or her duties, </p><p>or in any way disobeys the orders of the com- </p><p>munity, dire punishment results. </p><p> In former times this was death, but the beings,</p><p>though so heartless and cold blooded in many ways, </p><p>have done away with the death penalty now and </p><p>have hit upon a far more sensible plan which would</p><p>be a credit to human beings. To destroy life, they </p><p>argue, is, if the being is healthy and uninjured, a </p><p>loss to the community and necessitates a vast </p><p>and xoSJogy had not brought to his attention tho well known fact </p><p>that many if not all crustaceans possess this same habit. Indeed, our </p><p>common decapods—lobsters and crabs—are altnost helpless nnd appear </p><p>to lack the sense of direction and the power of definite movements </p><p>and hearing until tiny grains of sand had been inserted in their </p><p>ears. </p><p> Possibly, in the super-developed crustaeean-like creatures Mr.</p><p>Bishop describes, the pebbles in the ears have soino bearing upon </p><p>their strange means of inter-communication, .acting possibly as sensi- </p><p>tive detectors to vibratory waves or as sound amplifiers to make the </p><p>waves audible. Mr. Bishop also forgot, or was not aware, that the </p><p>higher vertebrates and even human beings possess small bones or 6ony </p><p>objectS'in the ears. The exact use of these has never been definitely </p><p>ascertained; although_it is known that they control the sense of bal- </p><p>11 is .^Possible that they also serve to pick up iti- </p><p>cudiblc waves and thus give human beings and other mammals a </p><p>sense of direction or the "sixth sense” so much more developed in </p><p>eomc individuals than others. It is even within the bounds of pos- </p><p>cioility that the inexplicable feats of mental telepathy and mind </p><p>reading may depend upon the development or sensitiveness of these </p><p>ear boues.—A. E. L. </p><p>72t </p><p>amount of time and trouble in fitting another to </p><p>take the place of the individual destroyed. So, in- </p><p>stead of killing offenders, the violator of law or </p><p>customs is sent to a far distant part of the country </p><p>which is devoted entirely to such offenders, and </p><p>there is forced to rely upon his or her own resources </p><p>to live and succeed. It is in this way that all the </p><p>communities are first established. These convict </p><p>colonies, as I might call them, are under the super- </p><p>vision of the chief settlement and each year are </p><p>inspected. </p><p> If all is going well a certain number of the young</p><p>of both sexes and different professions is alloted </p><p>to them, while if matters are not being carried out </p><p>satisfactorily the colony is broken up and the mem- </p><p>bers divided among other new colonies in still more </p><p>isolated parts of the land. </p><p> Moreover, any disturbances or troubles which</p><p>may arise or any rebellions against the authorities, </p><p>are quickly quelled without loss of life or bloodshed. </p><p>This is done by simply turning off the power in </p><p>the community where the trouble occurs, and, with- </p><p>out the power from the great central station, the </p><p>beings are utterly helpless. They cannot have light, </p><p>cannot prepare food, cannot use their airships and </p><p>cannot exist for any length of time. </p><p> I have spoken of the soldiers or police, and have</p><p>said that as there is no further need for them they </p><p>are being given up, and that no new members of </p><p>the force are being raised. Wars among themselves </p><p>are things of the distant past and the only use for </p><p>the police today is to regulate sanitary and other </p><p>rules and to act as escorts or guards and to prevent </p><p>injuries in crowds or through accidents. But such </p><p>things are now so rare and the beings are so well </p><p>trained and so careful to follow out all rules and </p><p>regulations, which they make themselves, that the </p><p>police have little to do. Indeed, I was told that the </p><p>occasion of my arrival was the first time that this </p><p>body had been called out in more than twenty years. </p><p> I have so often spoken of things occurring in</p><p>years past or of happenings ages ago that a word </p><p>of explanation is necessary. There is, I found, a </p><p>group of the creatures whose sole duty is to keep </p><p>the history and records of the country and its deni- </p><p>zens. These records are never written, but are re- </p><p>tained in the minds of the historians. And, in- </p><p>credible as it may appear, so long have these beings </p><p>been trained to this one duty that their power to </p><p>remember the most minute details is simply amaz- </p><p>ing. They know nothing else to be sure, and are </p><p>almost too helpless even to move or feed themselves, </p><p>for every sense is devoted to storing away facts </p><p>for future reference. Of course one would think </p><p>that there must come a time when the historical </p><p>facts would become so numerous that no brain </p><p>could hold them, but this is overcome in a very </p><p>clever manner. </p><p> No one member of the historian group is expected</p><p>to remember more than a certain number of facts, </p><p>or more than a certain number of different facts. </p><p>Each member retains facts of his own particular </p><p>class which cover a certain period so that these </p><p>beings are like a number of volumes. Each year </p><p>the number of historians in each class is increased </p><p>by two, or, as I might say, the living volumes of </p><p>the nation's history are added to annually, one of </p><p>the new members of each class absorbing and </p><p>728 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>memorizing all the data of the oldest historian in </p><p>his class, while the other new member of each class </p><p>memorizes every event in his line which occurs dur- </p><p>ing the year following *his appointment. Thus the </p><p>material known to the older members is always </p><p>duplicated in a young new member and cannot be </p><p>lost if the former dies -or -meets with an accident, </p><p>while new events are recorded on fresh brains with- </p><p>out adding to the burden on the older ones. At the </p><p>present time there are approximately twenty-thou- </p><p>sand of these living volumes of history and by </p><p>means of calculations—which I found far more in- </p><p>volved than working out a ship’s position by stars— </p><p>I found that the history thus available covers a </p><p>period of about thirty-two thousand years, for in </p><p>earlier days the new members were not appointed </p><p>annually. Of course it is a rather difficult matter </p><p>to look up any certain fact with such a mental </p><p>history to refer to, but the fact that each class or </p><p>line of incidents is in the mental charge of separate </p><p>beings renders it more easy. Thus there are beings </p><p>who knows nothing of history-with the exception of </p><p>industrial events, others know only those occur- </p><p>rences related to politics, others to inventions, </p><p>others to wars and still others whose minds are </p><p>filled with facts and data regarding scientific mat- </p><p>ters. </p><p> But as I have said before there is no such time</p><p>as years as we know them, all time being divided </p><p>or calculated from generation to generation, but </p><p>as the new broods of the creatures arrive very </p><p>nearly a year apart—as nearly as I can figure it out </p><p>—their computation of time corresponds roughly </p><p>with our years. And now, while I think of it, let </p><p>me mention a most remarkable thing which at- </p><p>tracted my attention from the first, but which re- </p><p>mained a mystery to me for a long time. I men- </p><p>tioned that when I first reached the land I noted </p><p>an intense blue quality to the light, and after my </p><p>first amazement at the strange inhabitants and my </p><p>confusion at my surroundings had passed, I noticed </p><p>that there was no night. At first I thought that I </p><p>was mistaken in this and that I had merely slept </p><p>the twenty-four hours through, but I soon dis- </p><p>covered that darkness never descended on this land, </p><p>and that bright light streamed steadily from the </p><p>sky. I had thought this=was most amazing and that </p><p>the sun always shone. But I soon found that this </p><p>was not the case, and that there were streamers of </p><p>light like the aurora which, however, remained </p><p>steadfast and like great bands of blinding flame </p><p>constantly'shedding their light upon the place. More- </p><p>over, these bands gave, as I have said, a blue or </p><p>rather violet light, but whether this was the actual</p><p>color of the light itself or was due to some peculiar- </p><p>ity in the atmosphere I have never learned. </p><p> I feel sure, however, that this ceaseless daylight</p><p>and the fact that the warm and balmy climate </p><p>never varies ten degrees, was the cause of all animal </p><p>life growing to huge proportions, and also aided </p><p>the strange crustacean-like beings to reach such a </p><p>high state of development. It also accounted for </p><p>their dwelling being underground, while the blue </p><p>quality of the light-was, I found, an important fac- </p><p>tor in many things. Later, as I shall explain, I </p><p>discovered that without it many remarkable things </p><p>were impossible. But I am digressing and must re- </p><p>turn to the subject of the inhabitants, although it </p><p>was the fact that the light had a great influence </p><p>on them that caused me to make a note of the double </p><p>suns and the light at this point of my narrative. </p><p> I stated that each Class of the inhabitants was</p><p>distinct, and that the appendages of a miner, arti- </p><p>zan, chemist, etc., were adapted to the duties of each, </p><p>and yet I soon found that the newly hatched young </p><p>were all identical. ^Moreover, they bore no slightest </p><p>resemblance to the adults. They were, in fact, </p><p>pulpy, soft, misshapen things with immense goggle </p><p>eyes, spiny heads, and with slender, worm-like, </p><p>naked bodies bearing ten little flipper-like append- </p><p>ages. A few hours after hatching out they shed </p><p>their skins and altered in appearance, and every </p><p>day or two thereafter, their shells were cast, and </p><p>with each shedding they became more and more like </p><p>the full grown creatures. But during this period </p><p>between hatching and- full development, they could </p><p>be incredibly altered .or changed by being fed with </p><p>certain foods or chemicals and by being exposed to </p><p>certain forces, or I might say rays, produced by </p><p>combinations of the black mineral and sulphur com- </p><p>pounds. Thus, if a batch of young is selected to be </p><p>chemists they are specially treated as soon as </p><p>hatched, and each time their skins are cast their ap- </p><p>pendages become more and more like those of the </p><p>chemists, until when fully developed, they are per- </p><p>fectly adapted to their predestined trade. </p><p> I must not forget, too, to call attention to the</p><p>fact that there are no rich or well-to-do members </p><p>of the community, that is, in the way that we under- </p><p>stand riches. Some of the beings have more luxur- </p><p>ious homes than others, some seem more brilliantly </p><p>garbed, and some possess air ships while others do </p><p>not. But anyone may if he or she desires, have as </p><p>much as any of the others. It is all a matter of </p><p>wishes and personal tastes, for the resources of the </p><p>entire country are equally at the disposal of all. Not </p><p>that any inhabitant can demand a luxurious home, </p><p>magnificently colored garments and a ftuge airship.</p><p>Whatever is allowed the being is his or her just </p><p>dues as a pro-rata share of all and if a taste runs </p><p>to airships rather than luxuries at -home, the in- </p><p>dividual can follow his or her taste in the matter. </p><p>All power, light and sustenance are however equally </p><p>divided and there is no such thing as money or </p><p>trade. Services are the only values here, and as </p><p>each trade or profession is predetermined, all ser- </p><p>vices are accounted of equal value and there are no </p><p>social cliques or lines and no aristocracy. A miner </p><p>or laborer is equal in every way to one of the rulers </p><p>or the guardians of the community, and is entitled </p><p>to an equal share in everything needed. </p><p> But the large ships, such as the one in which I</p><p>had traveled across the sea to the city, were I found </p><p>community craft. They are, so to speak, govern- </p><p>ment airships and constantly patrol the entire coun- </p><p>try, or are used in carrying workers to far distant </p><p>places and distributing necessities and supplies </p><p>among the inhabitants. They are the only means </p><p>of transportation and I was amazed that these be- </p><p>ings should have invented such marvelous craft and </p><p>yet know nothing of railways, motor cars, or in </p><p>fact any form of wheeled vehicle. But I discovered, </p><p>a short time ago, why this is so, and my discovery </p><p>was, in many ways, far more astonishing than any- </p><p>thing I had learned since reaching this remarkable </p><p>land. </p><p>BEYOND THE POKE </p><p>729 </p><p>CHAPTER VII </p><p>I FIND, that for some reason, I have become </p><p>greatly changed since reaching this strange </p><p>country. I have become philosophical, or per- </p><p>haps I might better say pessimistic, and I have </p><p>spent many hours pondering on matters to which, </p><p>hitherto, I gave no thought. I have wondered why </p><p>these beings exist, why they toil and labor and </p><p>progress, and what part they play in the scheme ox </p><p>this universe. When I have asked what object they </p><p>had in view, why they strove, I have been told </p><p>that it was for the good of the race, for the </p><p>benefit of the nation, for the future of their </p><p>kind. Exactly the same answers that I have </p><p>heard to similar queries from humans. But </p><p>what I have wondered, is that good, that benefit, </p><p>that future? Meaningless words, I think. Here </p><p>are these creatures, laboring that they may live, </p><p>living that they may labor,—in an endless circle. To </p><p>be sure they have advanced in some ways far beyond </p><p>my fellow men, and no doubt will advance still more, </p><p>but of what avail? They are but giant crustaceans </p><p>after all, and they hatch from eggs, toil through </p><p>life at the tasks to which they are trained, and </p><p>come to their death and are forgotten after their </p><p>brief span of life has been spent, and the world </p><p>knows not even that they exist. And on the other </p><p>side of the world, in the land of men, human beings </p><p>are born, labor and die utterly unknown to these </p><p>beings. What does it all mean; what place has it </p><p>all in the scheme of the Universe, I wonder? And </p><p>when I think on such matters I feel that after all </p><p>my life is of little moment, that though I am here </p><p>and my lot is cast among such weird beings, it </p><p>makes no difference to the world or to the future, </p><p>for I am but an atom of the whole, one of countless </p><p>millions of cogs in the gigantic wheel of nature. </p><p>And while I cannot fathom the riddle of life yet I </p><p>feel that I must have my place in the whole, that </p><p>Fate has seen fit to place me here and that, even if </p><p>all the puny efforts of men and of these creatures </p><p>seem to lead nowhere, yet must each one of us, and </p><p>of them, be as essential to the machinery of the </p><p>Universe as any cog in a real wheel, and without </p><p>which the whole vast mechanism would jar and jolt </p><p>and go wrong. So, instead of brooding upon my </p><p>lot and spending my time vainly wishing to regain </p><p>my fellow men, I have become resigned. </p><p> But I can find no affection, no liking, no fellow</p><p>feeling for these beings. They have treated me </p><p>kindly, my every want is provided for, and I occupy </p><p>a far more important place than ever I could have </p><p>filled in my world. And in brains, in attainments</p><p>and in many other ways these beings are even more </p><p>human than human beings. Yet so strongly in- </p><p>fluenced are we by physical appearances that to me </p><p>these creatures are still but beasts and I feel apart </p><p>from them and with little in common. It is perhaps </p><p>akin to the feeling that one race of human beings </p><p>has for another, the same feeling that prevents the </p><p>white and black races from thorough sympathy and </p><p>understanding, and that creates prejudices and ill </p><p>feelings in the nations of the world I knew. </p><p> And another thing. These beings, though so</p><p>intelligent, so industrious, so far advanced, are </p><p>such brainless, silly creatures! Though they toil </p><p>and work feverishly and seem to have no idle mom- </p><p>ents to spare, yet they will cease all, will drop every- </p><p>thing and gather in crowds for the most trivial rea- </p><p>sons. Yes, even without a reason. Let one of the </p><p>scurrying, hurrying workers stop and gaze about </p><p>and instantly a crowd collects, all gazing in the </p><p>same direction, though there is nothing unusual </p><p>to be seen, and quite forgetting the tasks on which </p><p>they were sent. And they are childish to a degree. </p><p>The simplest, most nonsensical things will fascinate </p><p>them to such an extent that everything is at a </p><p>standstill. </p><p> Wishing to find exercise and recreation I devised</p><p>a set of ninepins and a ball, and at sight of these, </p><p>the throngs grew wildly excited. They gathered </p><p>about, waving their antennae, turning their long- </p><p>stalked eyes about, dropping everything, and for </p><p>an entire day practically all work was abandoned </p><p>while the beings amused themselves with my crude </p><p>toys. Tossing a ball and catching it, spinning a </p><p>top, and a score of other simple amusements, proved </p><p>equally exciting and interesting to the beings, and </p><p>the rulers begged me to confine my activities at </p><p>such things to recreation hours for fear a great </p><p>calamity might result. </p><p> But after all in such matters they are much like</p><p>men and I wonder if the planets are inhabited and </p><p>if their denizens also possess similar characteristics </p><p>and peculiarities. </p><p> All this, however, is leading me from the course</p><p>of my narrative. I have mentioned that I dis- </p><p>covered why the beings had no vehicles, save air- </p><p>ships, and why, though they were so far in advance </p><p>of human science, they apparently knew nothing </p><p>of many of our most useful and important every </p><p>day matters and inventions. </p><p> It came about in this way.</p><p> I was seated upon the shores of the lake and</p><p>gazing across its broad and tranquil surface towards </p><p>the dim and distant mountain ranges. Sailor-like </p><p>my mind turned to boats. What a pleasure it would </p><p>be, I thought, to have some good craft in which to </p><p>sail those waters, to go where I willed and to ex- </p><p>plore the shores. I had traveled much in the beings’ </p><p>airships, but I could not handle the contraptions </p><p>and I longed for the feel of a keel under my feet. </p><p>And why shouldn’t my desires be satisfied? To be </p><p>sure, I knew that to secure wood to build a boat was </p><p>out of the question; but there was the metal sul- </p><p>phur. This could be made in thin sheets and a metal </p><p>boat could be constructed. But then, I thought, </p><p>how would I manage to make the creatures under- </p><p>stand what I wanted? And even if I did could </p><p>they bend and form and rivet the plates? Then a </p><p>brilliant idea came to me. Why shouldn’t the boat </p><p>be fashioned of one single piece, moulded or cast </p><p>into form? It could be. And thus made it would be </p><p>stronger and better in every way than if built up </p><p>of plates. Strange that I had not thought of it </p><p>sooner. The airships’ hulls were thus formed and </p><p>I had only to make a model of the craft I wished </p><p>in order to have the creatures turn out a seamless </p><p>metal boat of incredible lightness and strength. </p><p>For a time, however, even the simple matter of the </p><p>model puzzled me until it occurred to me to make </p><p>this from a very thin sheet of metal which, after </p><p>considerable trouble, I pounded and bent into the </p><p>desired shape. </p><p> The result of my work, and rny efforts to make</p><p>730 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>the artizans grasp my ideas, was a boat about eigh- </p><p>teen feet in length and five feet beam drawing about </p><p>three feet aft. I cannot say the lines of the craft </p><p>were beautiful and I had no expectation of finding </p><p>her speedy, but she was staunch and buoyant and </p><p>I thoroughly enjoyed fitting her up. Metal tubes </p><p>were used for mast and spars, twisted fibre or yarns </p><p>of the same material as the beings used for their </p><p>textiles formed ropes and lines, and the sails were </p><p>made of the same fabric. All the time I was work- </p><p>ing the creatures regarded my labors with intense </p><p>interest, though at an entire loss to know what I </p><p>was about. But of all things the tackle and blocks </p><p>seemed to fascinate them the most. And when at </p><p>last my craft was ready and I hoisted sails, and </p><p>grasping the tiller, trimmed the sheets and sped off </p><p>with a fresh breeze, the creatures went almost mad </p><p>with excitement. Here, indeed, was a strange </p><p>condition of affairs. Beings who had gone far </p><p>beyond man’s dreams in accomplishments, who had </p><p>conquered the air and yet knew nothing of boats </p><p>or of sails and had never even seen blocks and </p><p>tackle. </p><p> Of my cruises in the craft I need say little. In</p><p>her I navigated the chain of great lakes or inland </p><p>seas, visiting out of the way spots and landing on </p><p>the very place where I had first thrown myself upon </p><p>the beach to drink the water after my terrible jour- </p><p>ney. Here I again attempted to scale the mountains </p><p>as have already mentioned. But either the climate </p><p>or the air had affected me, for before I had ascended </p><p>half way to the summits of the ridge I was utterly </p><p>spent and was forced to retrace my steps. This </p><p>was a great blow to me for I had hoped that sooner </p><p>or later I would be able to make my way back over </p><p>the mountains to the Antarctic and that I thus </p><p>might rejoin my fellow men. The perils I knew </p><p>were terrible and there was not one chance in a </p><p>million of my succeeding, but even this slim chance </p><p>was I felt better than to remain forever among </p><p>the weird beings. Even when I found it impossible </p><p>I was not utterly discouraged. Possibly, I thought, </p><p>there might be lower spots in the mountain range, </p><p>but in the end I found that the country was com- </p><p>pletely girded by towering mountains and that the </p><p>spot where I had crossed was the only point where </p><p>such a crossing had been possible. But all this </p><p>is apart from what I was about to set down. On </p><p>my explorations, however, I found that which had </p><p>a direct bearing upon my discovery as to why most </p><p>simple mechanical devices were unknown to the </p><p>creatures. In one spot I discovered a vast deposit </p><p>of coal, in another quantities of copper, and I also </p><p>found iron, silver, gold and many other metals and</p><p>minerals. Oddly enough, too, the ores seemed to </p><p>have been mined, for there were yawning openings </p><p>filled with debris which appeared to be old shafts </p><p>and tunnels, and yet I knew the beings used none </p><p>of the metals nor coal. But the discovery of the </p><p>latter started a new train of thought in my mind. </p><p>Could I not equip my craft with power and thus </p><p>be able to cruise about more rapidly and without </p><p>being dependent upon the wind ? Of course I might </p><p>have induced the creatures to supply me with the </p><p>strange invisible power they utilized, but somehow, </p><p>I longed for familiar things, for devices with which </p><p>1 was acquainted, and I cannot hope to express the </p><p>great comfort and happiness I found in my little </p><p>boat. Moreover, I felt the necessity of keeping </p><p>hands and mind busy and so I at once decided to </p><p>try my mechanical skill at designing and building </p><p>a small steam engine. Of course my knowledge of </p><p>machinery was limited, but I knew the principles </p><p>of steam and steam engines, and after weeks of </p><p>weary work and innumerable disappointments I </p><p>managed to turn out a crude sort of affair which </p><p>actually worked. To be sure it was far too cumber- </p><p>some and heavy, not to mention its small power, for </p><p>my craft, but once having mastered the affair I felt </p><p>that a second attempt would prove far easier and </p><p>more satisfactory than the first. </p><p> But the creatures, who had ’ patched every step of</p><p>the work, showed indescribable excitement as the </p><p>smoke rose from the funnel and the steam hissed </p><p>and the fly wheel revolved. From far and near </p><p>they flocked, more excited than I had ever seen </p><p>them, and I realized how Watt or Fulton or other </p><p>great inventors must have felt when at last they </p><p>proved that their theories were right and had </p><p>demonstrated to a wondering multitude that steam </p><p>could be harnessed and made to serve man. </p><p> And then came an astounding discovery. The</p><p>rulers wished to take possession of my crude engine; </p><p>not to operate it, but to place it in a special build- </p><p>ing, a sort of museum as I might say, as a prized </p><p>treasure. This was, I considered, not unnatural, </p><p>but when one of the historians—he who held the </p><p>most ancient records of the race,—explained that in </p><p>the dim history of the past the beings had made and </p><p>used such things, I was absolutely dumbfounded. </p><p>No one, he informed me, had ever seen the ma- </p><p>chines; they were merely tradition and were con- </p><p>sidered fabulous, and all unwittingly I had material- </p><p>ized something which by them was regarded very </p><p>much as we regarded relics of the Pharaohs or </p><p>of our prehistoric ancestors. Then the living </p><p>volume of the nation's history went on to explain </p><p>that legendary lore had it that the creatures’ </p><p>ancient forebears had possessed many other</p><p>strange and unknown devices and I was asked if </p><p>I could not also make some of these as fellow ex- </p><p>hibits in the historical museum. </p><p> Here then I found myself suddenly transformed</p><p>from a great inventor, proud of exhibiting my </p><p>superior knowledge and mechanical ability, to a </p><p>primitive being, a being out of the dim past, a mem- </p><p>ber of a race whose greatest achievements had been </p><p>known, used and discarded by these super-crusta- </p><p>ceans so long ago that even history held no actual </p><p>records of them. It was a great shock to my pride, </p><p>but I was quite willing to busy myself at any work </p><p>that would keep me occupied, even if it went only </p><p>to prove how far behind the times I wras, and soon </p><p>I became vastly interested in the wrork and, by my </p><p>efforts, reconstructing the forgotten past for the </p><p>strange beings. </p><p> Among the first things that I built was a cart,</p><p>and this amazed the creatures even more than the </p><p>engine. To them wheels were most marvelous </p><p>things, akin, I should say from their actions, to </p><p>magic or witchcraft, and I racked my brains to </p><p>puzzle out how it was that the wheel, which I had </p><p>always considered man’s most important mechanical </p><p>invention, should have been discarded and forgotten </p><p>by the lobster-like beings. Man cannot get on with- </p><p>out the wheel. It is the foundation, the basis, of </p><p>BEYOND THE POLE </p><p>731 </p><p>all industry, all machinery, all our most wonderful </p><p>accomplishments. And yet, here was a nation of </p><p>highly intelligent creatures, a race which had ad- </p><p>vanced immeasurably beyond humans in annihilat- </p><p>ing space and time, beings who had tapped the very </p><p>source of nature’s storehouse of power and who </p><p>had made marvelous discoveries and never used a </p><p>wheel in any form. To them the wheel was as ob- </p><p>solete and as useless as a stone axe or a flint knife </p><p>to us, but instantly, as they saw wheels, they became </p><p>fascinated with their uses and possibilities. Not </p><p>that they were of any real benefit in their lives </p><p>or occupations, but merely because they were </p><p>strange, antique curiosities which afforded the be- </p><p>ings new amusements and sports. Soon, carts or </p><p>wagons were everywhere, and being most adaptable </p><p>creatures, the inhabitants were not long in fitting </p><p>the vehicles with power receivers and were rattling </p><p>and bumping about in crude motor cars, or rather </p><p>motor wagons, as pleased as a lot of kids with new </p><p>toys. </p><p> I could not help thinking how this same power</p><p>applied to modern automobiles would revolutionize </p><p>jnotor cars in our world, and I fell to work with a </p><p>will striving to construct some sort of car which </p><p>would be an improvement over the solid wheeled, </p><p>uncomfortable things the creatures were using. I </p><p>cannot say that the result of my labors and inven- </p><p>tive powers would have been a worthy rival even of </p><p>a tin Lizzie, but it had a greater vogue among the </p><p>beings than even Ford’s famous product had among </p><p>humans, and motoring became the favorite sport of </p><p>the entire country. Incredibly swift airships were </p><p>abandoned, save for utility and business, and just </p><p>as we human beings—or a large number of us— </p><p>prefer sail boats or rowing, or even the primitive </p><p>savage canoe, to the steam or power boat when it </p><p>comes to recreation, or choose a slow-going horse </p><p>and carriage rather than a railway train or a motor </p><p>car for pleasure, so they preferred the crude vehicles </p><p>bumping over the earth to the silent, smooth sailing, </p><p>meteor-like airships. I cannot describe, cannot hope </p><p>to give a picture of the ridiculous, grotesque ap- </p><p>pearance the creatures presented in their new toys. </p><p>And accidents were innumerable. Indeed, I believe </p><p>it is the danger, the risk in using land vehicles, that </p><p>appeals most strongly to the creatures. They seem </p><p>to delight in collisions, in broken limbs, and are </p><p>reckless beyond words. No doubt the dangers are a </p><p>relief, for their airships are so constructed that ac- </p><p>cidents are next to impossible and collisions cannot </p><p>occur, for there are devices which operate in such a </p><p>way that if two ships come dangerously close the </p><p>mechanisms automatically operate to repel each</p><p>other. </p><p> Few fatalities have, however, resulted from the</p><p>use of wheeled vehicles, but beings lacking one or </p><p>more appendages or even antennae are seen every- </p><p>where. And they are marvelously expert in avoiding </p><p>mishaps by a hair’s breadth. Never have I seen </p><p>such mad driving and the worst traffic jams of New </p><p>York’s thoroughfares are nothing compared with </p><p>the congestion here in this metropolis of this </p><p>strange land. And the wheels are used for many </p><p>other amusements too. There are contraptions for </p><p>which I am responsible which might be called bicy- </p><p>cles, and hoop-rolling is a sport over which the be- </p><p>ings grow as excited and become as interested as </p><p>human beings over golf or tennis. </p><p> And of course, having seen the wonderful results</p><p>of my efforts and my, to them, prehistoric knowl- </p><p>edge, I tried my hand at a thousand and one other </p><p>matters. Bows and arrows were most astounding </p><p>things to these beings, and you can imagine my </p><p>amazement when, not content with using a single </p><p>bow, these weird creatures armed themselves with </p><p>three bows at once and discharged a perfect hail of </p><p>arrows at the targets. What warriors they would </p><p>make, I thought. What unconquerable foes, with </p><p>their ten appendages or limbs, eight of which could </p><p>be used for handling weapons. Each in fact would </p><p>equal eight men in one, and for the first time it </p><p>dawned upon me that herein was largely the secret </p><p>of their great .achievements, that they had been able </p><p>to accomplish eight times as much work as </p><p>humans, and I wondered what the results would </p><p>have been had Edison, Ford, Marconi or any of our </p><p>great inventors and geniuses been equipped by na- </p><p>ture to do eight times the work they have done. </p><p> Their aptitude with such primitive weapons as</p><p>bows and arrows aroused my interest as to what </p><p>they would do with firearms, and I bent my energies </p><p>and inventive powers to the task of making such </p><p>things. There was an abundance of sulphur, of </p><p>course, saltpeter was to be had and charcoal was not </p><p>an impossibility, but it was a long time before I </p><p>succeeded in making a mixture that would do more </p><p>than sputter and burn. But at last I had an apology </p><p>for gunpowder and the rest was simple. I had a </p><p>small cannon made, and having loaded it and placed </p><p>a sheet metal target before it, I touched it off. My </p><p>powder was poor, slow burning stuff, but it served </p><p>to throw the ball and made a respectable detonation, </p><p>but I was greatly disappointed at the effect upon the </p><p>assembled creatures who had gathered to watch the </p><p>demonstration. The noise and smoke did not sur- </p><p>prise them in the least, but I might have foreseen </p><p>this as they possessed an explosive far more power-</p><p>ful than powder or even dynamite. In fact it was </p><p>altogether too powerful for use in firearms, as I </p><p>discovered with almost fatal results to myself long </p><p>before I tried my hand at powder making. They ex- </p><p>amined the ragged hole torn by the missile in the </p><p>metal target and they showed some interest in this, </p><p>but their greatest wonder appeared to be that an </p><p>explosive capable of doing so much should have been </p><p>confined in the metal barrel of the gun. Aside from </p><p>this, however, the whole experiment failed to appeal </p><p>to them. They had no use for such things as guns </p><p>and powder, no need of offensive or defensive </p><p>weapons, and their own explosive was a thousand </p><p>times more valuable than powder for their pur- </p><p>poses. </p><p> And scores of other things which I made, after</p><p>endless failures and by dint of hardest work, were </p><p>as useless to them as the cannon. And then at last1 </p><p>it came to me that in this strange place man’s great- </p><p>est inventions, human beings’ most marvelous labor- </p><p>saving devices and our most prized luxuries and </p><p>conveniences had no place. That here was a race </p><p>or nation of beings where there was no struggle for </p><p>supremacy, no real industry for personal gain, no </p><p>riches, no poverty, no competition; that conditions, </p><p>life, everything, were totally unlike those of my </p><p>world and that these creatures, ages before my ar- </p><p>732 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>rival, had passed the stage of human civilization and </p><p>that to them our customs, habits and mode of life </p><p>would appear as barbarous and primitive as those </p><p>of the prehistoric cave dwellers to us. </p><p> There is no agriculture, so no demand for agri-</p><p>cultural machinery. No vast transportation of </p><p>foodstuffs and raw materials, for with power wher- </p><p>ever required and food and all things needed—with </p><p>the exception of sulphur—available anywhere, there </p><p>is little to be carried and airships are all that are </p><p>required. All resources are equally at the disposal </p><p>of every member of the community and hence there </p><p>is no struggle for existence or for wealth, and as </p><p>every member of the nation is developed, trained </p><p>and predestined, from the day of hatching, for some </p><p>definite place in life, there is no ambition, no desire </p><p>for advancement. In short these beings are mere </p><p>automatons, machines endowed with life, intelli- </p><p>gence and minds, and nothing more. They only </p><p>differ from insensate mechanisms inasmuch as they </p><p>have their times for rest and recreation, and I daily </p><p>thank God that human beings have not yet come to </p><p>such a pass. </p><p> Often, when among my fellow men, I have heard</p><p>arguments and have read articles in favor of a com- </p><p>munistic or socialistic life and government, and </p><p>picturing the ideal Utopia that the earth would be </p><p>if men could all be equal, if all wealth could be </p><p>equally divided and there could be no class distinc- </p><p>tions, no struggle for supremacy. Often, too, I have </p><p>in the past felt that such a state would be desirable, </p><p>and many a time, when fortune frowned upon me </p><p>and I compared my lot as a sailor with the ease and </p><p>luxury of wealthy passengers upon my ships, or </p><p>with the rich ship owners, I have felt bitterness </p><p>that some should be^so favored and others forced to </p><p>struggle through life in poverty. But now I realize </p><p>what dire results would follow were these socialists’ </p><p>ideas fulfilled. Now I realize that there could be no </p><p>ambition, no desire for betterment, no real happi- </p><p>ness in life and no pride if such conditions pre- </p><p>vailed. No, a thousand times no. Better dire </p><p>poverty, unending toil, the abuses and vices, the </p><p>wars and strife, all the wrongs and woes of mankind </p><p>and civilization than to become the heartless, imper- </p><p>sonal beings that such conditions would lead to. </p><p>What would the world of men be without love, senti- </p><p>ment, art, music, affection, ambition? What would </p><p>it be if the human race had no ideals beyond exis- </p><p>tence and the propagation of the species? What </p><p>would it be if there was nothing to spur men on, to </p><p>send them to sleep weary with the day’s work but </p><p>filled with dreams and visions of accomplishments</p><p>on the morrow; to awaken them filled with deter- </p><p>mination to succeed, to force their way to the top? </p><p>What would life amount to if men had no aims, no </p><p>ideals in life, no necessity to exert themselves, to </p><p>prove superiority to their fellows, to force their </p><p>individuality upon the world and to choose their </p><p>path in life and to be independent, free, leading </p><p>their own lives as they see fit and with no limit, save </p><p>their own intelligences and their labors, to what they </p><p>may accomplish? </p><p> It is this, this supposed idealistic sort of life of</p><p>these beings that made me so heartily sick of my </p><p>existence among them. Would that those who have </p><p>found such fault with our civilization, who have </p><p>endeavored to revolutionize human life and human </p><p>ways, and to upset conditions that the Almighty in </p><p>His infinite wisdom has established, might be hero </p><p>with me. Would that those socialistic agitators </p><p>might be forced to exist here among these creatures. </p><p> Anything rather than this state of affairs. At</p><p>times it seems as if I should go mad, and I find my- </p><p>self longing for something, anything, to upset this </p><p>machine-like monotonous life about me. Anger, </p><p>^strife, battle—aye, even a war with all its horrors </p><p>would be welcome. </p><p>CHAPTER VIII </p><p>ALONG time has passed since I penned my </p><p>lines. And now I know that beyond ques- </p><p>tion I am doomed to spend all my days </p><p>among these weird beings. Over and over again </p><p>I have attempted to find a way out, to discover a </p><p>means of scaling the mountains, for desperation </p><p>drove me, and death upon the ice-covered wastes of </p><p>the polar regions seemed preferable to life here. </p><p>But though strong, healthy and as able-bodied as </p><p>ever, yet, for some strange reason, I could not climb </p><p>those cliffs. Perhaps it is the food or drink that </p><p>has robbed me of the power to ascend even to </p><p>moderate heights, perchance dwelling in this air </p><p>with its unending blue light has had its effect, and </p><p>like the creatures who dwell here, I cannot live </p><p>where once I felt no ill effects. But whatever the </p><p>reason, the fact remains that each time I have </p><p>reached a height of a few hundred feet, my muscles </p><p>have failed me, my strength has given out, and I </p><p>have been forced to' give up. I am as hopelessly </p><p>caged here as though in a prison and yet the birds </p><p>come and go at will and I envy them beyond words </p><p>to express, as I watch the broad-winged albatrosses </p><p>and great white molly-mokes and screeching gulls </p><p>and know on their pinions they can rise above the </p><p>surrounding mountains and leave this side of the </p><p>world for the other that I shall never see again;</p><p>that no doubt they gaze upon my fellow men, upon </p><p>the wide blue sea, and upon white sailed ships and </p><p>great palatial steamships with the same express- </p><p>ionless eyes they turn upon me and upon the beings </p><p>dwelling here in this undreamed-of land. </p><p> To one of these free winged creatures, these</p><p>friends of old who come over the edge of the world </p><p>each year, I shall soon entrust this narrative. Per- </p><p>chance it may never reach a human being. The bird </p><p>may meet with disaster or it may never look on a </p><p>civilized man. Or again, even though scores, hun- </p><p>dreds, of my fellow men see the creatures, yet it may </p><p>pass unnoticed and the message may not be read. </p><p>But there is a chance that, with the metal cylinder, </p><p>in which I shall place my story&gt; dangling from its </p><p>leg, the albatross will attract the attention of some </p><p>one. Perhaps its nesting ground may be near some </p><p>party of whalemen, or even near a settlement, and </p><p>it is this chance I cling to. I have no fear that tho </p><p>cylinder will become detached or even broken, de- </p><p>spite the rough treatment it will no doubt receive, </p><p>and even if the bird is not found or the cylinder </p><p>.discovered for years, it and its contents will be </p><p>intact. I have selected the toughest and hardest of </p><p>the many varieties of metal for the cylinder, a metal </p><p>which is far harder than steel and which can be </p><p>opened or broken only by tremendous force or by a </p><p>heat greater than fire, and I have used a trails- </p><p>BEYOND THE POLE </p><p>733 </p><p>parent grade of the metal in order that any one </p><p>finding it may see that it contains a manuscript, </p><p>for I -well know how curious human beings are to </p><p>read any scrap of writing that is picked up in a </p><p>floating or stranded bottle. The cylinder being air </p><p>tight will preserve the manuscript, and the writing </p><p>is done with a fluid I found among the waste or </p><p>by-products of the sulphur factory. It is indelible </p><p>and will not fade, while the cord by which I shall </p><p>attach the cylinder to my bird messenger is of the </p><p>toughest woven metal and cannot be severed by any </p><p>ordinary means. </p><p> And what if my narrative is found and read?</p><p>Will any mortal man believe it? Will the finder, if </p><p>finder there be, credit such a story as will be dis- </p><p>closed? No, I suppose not. It is too incredible, </p><p>too ridiculous to pass as anything more than fiction </p><p>or the ramblings of a disordered mind. They will </p><p>think the writer crazy, a madman who has been set </p><p>down the delusions of his brain, or will think some </p><p>one is trying to perpetrate a gigantic hoax. </p><p> But again, perhaps, if God wills, my narrative</p><p>may fall into the hands of some person who will be </p><p>attracted by the strangeness of its container. The </p><p>transparent metal cylinder will perhaps arouse cu- </p><p>riosity, the material on which it is written may give </p><p>credence to my tale. And if so, then will it be </p><p>known beyond a doubt that it is no wild fancy, no </p><p>product of a crazy man; for nowhere in the world </p><p>of men are such materials known. Often I smile to </p><p>myself to think what a sensation will be created </p><p>when the newspapers print accounts of the dis- </p><p>covery of the strange manuscript in a still more </p><p>remarkable container. No doubt, in that case, my </p><p>story will be read by thousands, perhaps millions </p><p>of my fellow men. And yet, the cylinder in which I </p><p>send it may prove of greater interest and value to </p><p>the world than my story. I can picture the scien- </p><p>tists' excitement as they analyze the metal and dis- </p><p>cussions grow hot as to its origin, while inventors </p><p>strive to produce the same material for the benefit </p><p>of mankind. </p><p> Such thoughts are a diversion and a comfort to</p><p>me, and many hours I spend trying to picture in my </p><p>mind the results of my story and its effect upon the </p><p>world in case it ever reaches civilized men. </p><p> But I must cut short my imaginings, my hopes</p><p>and fears, for it is all aside from my tale and I must </p><p>confine myself to the story of my life here on this </p><p>unknown, mountain-walled continent among these </p><p>weird beings.</p><p>-x- -:&lt;■ * </p><p> Since I last took up my manuscript to write, many</p><p>events have occurred, but that which is of greatest </p><p>importance, though the creatures here make little of </p><p>it, is the escape of the captive ants from the zoo </p><p>wherein they were confined. </p><p> To me there is something threatening in this,</p><p>and I cannot rid myself of a feeling of a dire </p><p>calamity impending. Always I had been fascinated </p><p>by the gigantic insects, and hours after hours I </p><p>have spent, watching them as they labored and </p><p>rushed about, drilling, carrying on strange evolu- </p><p>tions, marching and countermarching, seemingly </p><p>aimlessly, within their fenced enclosure. </p><p> That they could escape, no one dreamed; for as I</p><p>have said, they were hedged in by network of ma- </p><p>terial fatal to them. But escape they did, and not </p><p>an ant remains within the pen nor was there a dead </p><p>ant to tell of the insects having touched the death </p><p>dealing netting. No, they had been far too intelli- </p><p>gent for that, and their apparently aimless labors </p><p>had been but a clever ruse, a means of concealing </p><p>their true purpose of tunelling to great depths and, </p><p>by means of an unsuspected subterranean passage, </p><p>vanishing, no one knows where. And I feel sure </p><p>that their constant drilling, their military-like ac- </p><p>tions, were no more purposeless than their work. </p><p>To be sure they are few—not more than two hun- </p><p>dred at most—and the inhabitants have no fears. </p><p>They assure me that the ants will soon be recaptur- </p><p>ed, that in airships these beings can locate the </p><p>fugitives and either take or destroy them, and that, </p><p>even if such means fail, the ants may be destroyed </p><p>by scattering the deadly compound about their </p><p>haunts and by preventing them from securing food. </p><p> Moreover, they point out, the ants are few and</p><p>are no menace unless in vast numbers, and that </p><p>long before they can increase enough to be danger- </p><p>ous they will again be under control. </p><p> _ But I cannot put aside my fears, my premoni-</p><p>tions. Who can say where the ants have gone? </p><p>Who can say what their numbers may be? For all </p><p>anyone knows they may have been increasing by </p><p>thousands beneath the earth, may have been waiting </p><p>for months or years until they had reared a horde </p><p>of their kind in the dark, unseen passages under- </p><p>ground. And their strength, activity and tireless- </p><p>ness, are prodigious. One of the great insects has </p><p>the strength of a score of men or the muscular </p><p>powers of several giant lobster-like beings. And </p><p>they multiply with amazing rapidity. Even now</p><p>they may number countless thousands, may be bid- </p><p>ing their time in some hidden subterranean lair, </p><p>storing food, making plans, drilling; only waiting </p><p>for the time when they will be ready and prepared </p><p>to overwhelm the country with their armies. And </p><p>the strangest part of it is that such thoughts should </p><p>trouble me. Why should it matter to me whether </p><p>these lobster-like beings or the giant ants are in </p><p>supremacy? Why should I care what takes place in </p><p>this country in which I have no interest and which I </p><p>have grown to hate and detest? It is not fear of </p><p>personal injuries or death, but I shudder at the </p><p>thought of being made captive or being destroyed </p><p>by the ants, for death I feel, might prove bettor </p><p>than a life among these creatures. I have tried to </p><p>analyze my feelings, to fathom the cause of my </p><p>worries and, though it sounds ridiculous, though </p><p>even to me it seems impossible, yet I feel sure that </p><p>it is due to a sense of patriotism. </p><p> Patriotism for a land that is my prison, for a</p><p>race of beings with whom I have nothing in com- </p><p>mon! And yet it is so. Although I chafe at my </p><p>enforced life here, although I long to be away from </p><p>the country and its denizens, although their life, </p><p>ways and personalities are all repugnant to me, yet </p><p>such a strange thing is the human mind that I feel </p><p>as greatly concerned over the impending danger </p><p>as if these beings were of my own race and it </p><p>was my own country. </p><p> Yes, and if it comes to battle, to a war between</p><p>the ants and these supercrustaceans, I know in my </p><p>heart that I shall find myself battling against the </p><p>ants, using my every effort to aid these monstrous </p><p>beings in overthrowing their hereditary enemies. </p><p>734 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> Little did I dream, when I wrote, months ago,</p><p>that even war would be welcome, how soon my </p><p>words were to be borne out, for war, bloody, merci- </p><p>less, relentless and horrible beyond words to ex- </p><p>press is, I feel sure, near at hand. </p><p> *</p><p> A month or more has passed since last I wrote,</p><p>and, during that interval events have moved rapidly. </p><p>The ants have been discovered. Scouts have found </p><p>them, and my worst fears have been more than ful- </p><p>filled. In incalculable thousands they are swarm- </p><p>ing on a vast uninhabited area in the north, drill- </p><p>ing, gathering vast stores and evidently preparing </p><p>for a campaign. And yet these beings are not dis- </p><p>turbed, have no fears and have made little effort </p><p>to repel or destroy their enemies. From airships </p><p>quantities of the death dealing chemicals were drop- </p><p>ped upon the ants but with little result. A few </p><p>were killed but instantly the alarm was given the </p><p>ants vanished like magic, seeking safe refuge in </p><p>subterranean burrows. I have urged these crea- </p><p>tures to set forth and attack, to take the offensive </p><p>against the ants, to drop explosives from airships </p><p>and thus shatter the burrows and destroy the occu- </p><p>pants. And I have sought to induce them to sur- </p><p>round themselves with barriers of the ant poison. </p><p>, But my words have been unheeded so far. So long </p><p>have these creatures lived in peace, so long have </p><p>they been in complete control, and so many years </p><p>have passed since they battled with the ants that </p><p>they have forgotten the terrible power and re- </p><p>sources of their enemies and underrate them. Too </p><p>late, I fear, will they awaken. </p><p> But I have not been idle. With the aid of a few</p><p>who have given ear to my advice I have taken what </p><p>steps we can to protect the city. We have laid </p><p>mines about it which can be exploded, and in two </p><p>airships we have attempted to destroy the ants’ re- </p><p>treats with explosive, but our puny efforts have </p><p>been of little avail. Moreover, in our last assault, </p><p>one of the airships was disabled by a premature </p><p>explosion and fell to earth, and I shudder as I write </p><p>when I think of the awful scene I witnessed when </p><p>the ants rushed upon the occupants of the airship </p><p>and with ravenous jaws tore them in pieces while </p><p>still alive. </p><p> And if the ants are victorious that will be the</p><p>fate of all, yes even of myself. But I have no mind </p><p>to meet with such a fearful death. I have provision- </p><p>ed my boat and if worst comes to worst I shall flee</p><p>in her. Across the water the ants cannot follow </p><p>and miles distant I know of a large island where I </p><p>shall seek safety—there to pass the remaining days </p><p>of my life alone. </p><p> A week since I wrote those last lines. The ants</p><p>are advancing now. Already they have over- </p><p>whelmed two outlying towns and against them the </p><p>poison and even the explosives seem useless. Slow- </p><p>ly but inexorably they come, making their way by </p><p>underground passages, scurrying to safe retreats </p><p>far under the earth at first sight of an airship. It </p><p>is tei'rible, nightmarish, this invisible, silent ad- </p><p>vance of the vast hordes of terrible creatures, and </p><p>the inhabitants are now terror stricken. </p><p> Barriers of the poison have been passed by the</p><p>ants tunnelling beneath them; hundreds of the in- </p><p>habitants of the countryside have fallen victims to </p><p>the relentless insects, and each day their numbers </p><p>increase and they draw nearer to this metropolis. </p><p> They are within a few miles of the power plant</p><p>and at any moment may take possession of the sul- </p><p>phur mines. And then the doom of the beings will </p><p>be sealed. Without resources, without power, all </p><p>will be helpless, doomed to perish miserably or be- </p><p>come prisoners of the ants. And there is no retreat. </p><p>The insects have overrun the land, have thrown out </p><p>great encircling armies and our scouts report them </p><p>on every side </p><p> And now a new and more terrible thing has oc-</p><p>curred. The ants are swarming. Their queens, </p><p>winged and capable of flight, are filling the air, </p><p>darkening the skies and dropping here, there, every- </p><p>where to establish new colonies. Hundreds of them </p><p>have even dropped within the city and although they </p><p>have been destroyed yet their numbers seem un- </p><p>diminished. Unseen, they drop at night, hurrying </p><p>to hidden spots they deposit their eggs, and ere </p><p>their presence is suspected the warriors have emerg- </p><p>ed and fall upon the surprised inhabitants and tear </p><p>them to bits. In their extremity the creatures have </p><p>besought me to equip them with bows and arrows, </p><p>guns, anything in the form of weapons. And these </p><p>have helped. With their arrows, with the bullets </p><p>from the crude firearms, they have managed to </p><p>keep the ant army in check, for these are things </p><p>new to the ants and they have no means of resisting </p><p>them. Desperate as our case is, yet I have smiled </p><p>to think how history repeats itself, how these be- </p><p>ings have been forced to resort to prehistoric, prim- </p><p>itive means to preserve their homes and lives, just </p><p>as the armies of Europe, despite modern weapons </p><p>high explosives, poisonous gasses and every latest </p><p>scientific device, were forced to resort to armor,</p><p>grenades, medieaval weapons and methods to com- </p><p>bat the Germans. </p><p> And even the wagons, the motor vehicles, have</p><p>been brought into play against the ants, for the </p><p>airships are next to useless. Let an airship rise </p><p>aloft and the swarming queen ants light upon it by </p><p>hundreds and bear it to earth with their weight, </p><p>but the wheeled vehicles, protected, transformed </p><p>to miniature forts of metal and filled with armed </p><p>beings, carry terror and destruction among the ants, </p><p>crushing them beneath the wheels while arrows and </p><p>bullets strike them down. </p><p> But despite all I feel that we are losing, that our</p><p>efforts have been made too late and that at any </p><p>moment the horde of insects will everwhelm the </p><p>power plant and we will be incapable of making </p><p>food, of producing light, of manufacturing any- </p><p>thing, even of operating our vehicles. Long have I </p><p>foreseen this and in preparation for the calamity </p><p>I have had steam engines built, but these are all too </p><p>few to serve all our wants. Would that these beings </p><p>had but given heed to my words long ago and then </p><p>all might have been well. Too long they waited </p><p>and then panic stricken turned to me begging me to </p><p>take charge, beseeching me to save them. The fate </p><p>of the country, of the inhabitants depends upon me </p><p>but I feel that no human effoi’ts, nothing that these </p><p>beings under my directions can accomplish, will do </p><p>more than delay the end. </p><p>* * -x- </p><p> What I dreaded most has befallen. The ants are</p><p>in possession of the power plant. Everything is at a </p><p>standstill. Only the barest necessities of life can be </p><p>BEYOND THE POLE </p><p>735 </p><p>produced with the puny, limited power of my </p><p>machines, the ancient antiquated mechanisms dis- </p><p>carded ages ago by these beings, but what now, </p><p>when all their marvelous inventions have failed </p><p>them, are proving their salvation, their one hope. </p><p> And it is but a forlorn hope. We are besieged</p><p>encompassed, surrounded, and each day the en- </p><p>circling cordon is drawing irresistibly nearer. </p><p> I fear even to wait longer to entrust this manu-</p><p>script to a bird. If I wait it may be too late, so </p><p>tomorrow I shall enclose it in a metal cylinder and </p><p>shall lash it to the leg of a great albatross I have </p><p>captured. </p><p> And I am ready to flee, to take to my boat. Each</p><p>day, each hour, the inhabitants are deserting the </p><p>city. They are taking to the water, are reverting </p><p>to the habits of their long forgotten ancestors, are </p><p>becoming crustaceans once more, and forgetting </p><p>all their great works, all their civilization, all their </p><p>evolved mentalities, are seeking the depths of the </p><p>lake and reverting to a submarine life. Perchance </p><p>ere the city falls all the beings will have forsaken </p><p>the life they have led for generations, and in the </p><p>water and the slime beneath it, will have found </p><p>safety and there will forget all and will degenerate </p><p>to the lobsters from which they rose. ’Tis a. strange, </p><p>a bizarre thought, but man, in time of dire ex- </p><p>tremity, when overwhelmed and destroyed, has </p><p>more than once reverted to savagery and every great </p><p>nation has fallen, so perhaps ’tis but the law of </p><p>nature, the working out of God’s plan- </p><p> I am about to close, to seal my manuscript to;</p><p>send it out to the world, and I must make haste. </p><p>Scarcely a dozen of the inhabitants are left. All </p><p>but these have deserted. Within the hour the ants </p><p>will overwhelm the city. I must hurry to my boat </p><p>and escape ere it is too late. </p><p> Yes, even now they are coming. They are in the</p><p>outskirts. Their hordes will cut off my retreat if </p><p>I do not close at once. It is the end. My narrative </p><p>must be sealed and entrusted to the albatross which </p><p>for many weeks I have held captive and awaiting </p><p>this time. God grant that it may reach the hand of </p><p>some fellow man.” </p><p>The End </p><p>I  llllllliillillM  1</p><p>...

The grandfather had come to an untimely </p><p>end in a rather unpleasant fashion which Burl </p><p>remembered vaguely as a succession of screams </p><p>coming more and more faintly to his ears while he </p><p>was being carried away at the top speed of which </p><p>his mother was capable. </p><p> Burl had rarely or never thought of the old</p><p>gentleman since. Surely he had never wondered </p><p>in the abstract of what his greatgrandfather </p><p>thought, and most surely of all, there never entered </p><p>his head such a purely hypothetical question as the </p><p>one of what his many-times-great-grandfather— </p><p>say of the year 1920—would have thought of the </p><p>scene in which Burl found himself. </p><p> He was treading cautiously over a brownish car-</p><p>pet of fungus growth, creeping furtively toward </p><p>the stream which he knew by the generic title of </p><p>“water.” It was the only water he knew. Toweir^ </p><p>ing far above his head, three man-heights high, </p><p>great toadstools hid the grayish sky from his sight. </p><p>Clinging to the foot-thick stalks of the toadstools </p><p>■were still other fungi, parasites upon the growths </p><p>that had once been parasites themselves. </p><p> Burl himself was a slender young man wearing a</p><p>single garment twisted about his waist, made from </p><p>the wing-fabric of a great moth, the members of his </p><p>tribe had slain as it emerged from its cocoon. His </p><p>skin was fair, without a trace of sunburn. In all </p><p>his lifetime he had never seen the sun, though the </p><p>sky was rarely hidden from view save by the giant </p><p>fungi which, with monster cabbages, were the only </p><p>growing things he knew. </p><p>Clouds usually spread Bagnio— </p><p>overhead, and when they </p><p>did not, the perpetual </p><p>haze made the sun but an </p><p>indefinitely brighter part </p><p>of the sky, never a sharp- </p><p>ly edged ball of fire. </p><p>Fantastic mosses, mis- </p><p>shapen fungus growths, </p><p>colossal molds and yeasts, </p><p>were the essential parts</p><p>of the landscape through </p><p>which he moved. </p><p> Once as he had dodged</p><p>through the forest of huge </p><p>toadstools, his shoulder </p><p>touched a cream-colored </p><p>stalk, giving the whole </p><p>fungus a tiny shock. Instantly, from the umbrella- </p><p>like mass of pulp overhead, a fine and impalpable </p><p>powder fell upon him like snow. It was the season </p><p>when the toadstools sent out their spores, or seeds, </p><p>and they had been dropped upon him at the first </p><p>sign of disturbance. </p><p> Furtive as lie was, he paused to brush them from</p><p>his head and hair. They were deadly poison, as he </p><p>knew well. </p><p> Burl would have been a curious sight to a man</p><p>of the twentieth century. His skin was pink like </p><p> JT/ E recently published a charming tale by the author</p><p> of this story, entitled "The Runaway Skyscraper."</p><p> Great as zvas that story, this one is even greater. The pos-</p><p> sibility that our planet will some day be dominated by the</p><p> insect world has been admitted by our greatest entomolo-</p><p> gists, and the possibility of this is not half so remote as</p><p> one might think.</p><p> Some of our deepest thinkers believe that it is not only</p><p> possible, but most probable, that this may happen, or pos-</p><p> sibly has happened in the past. At any rote, Mr. Murray</p><p> Leinster gives us an insight into the life of our planet</p><p> under the altered conditions.</p><p> It is a story tremendous in its possibilities, and the au-</p><p> thor has written it with such a facile pen, that you can-</p><p> not lay the story aside until you have come to its con-</p><p> clusion.</p><p>his body. Even that on top of his head was soft </p><p>and downy. His chest was larger than his fore- </p><p>fathers’ had been, and his ears seemed almost cap- </p><p>able of independent movement, to catch threaten- </p><p>ing sounds from any direction. His eyes, large </p><p>and blue, possessed pupils which could dilate to </p><p>extreme size, allowing him to see in almost com- </p><p>plete darkness. </p><p> He was the result of the thirty thousand years’</p><p>attempt of the human race to adapt itself to the </p><p>change that had begun in the latter half of the </p><p>twentieth century. </p><p> At about that time, civilization had been high,</p><p>and apparently secure. Mankind had reached a</p><p>permanent agreement within itself, and all men </p><p>had equal opportunities to education and leisure. </p><p>Machinery did most of the labor of the world, and </p><p>men were only required to supervise its operation. </p><p>AH men were well-fed, all men were well-educated, </p><p>and it seemed that until the end of time the earth </p><p>would be the abode of a community of comfortable </p><p>human beings, pursuing their studies and diver- </p><p>sions, their illusions and their truths.- Peace, </p><p>quietness, privacy, freedom were universal. </p><p> Then, just when men were congratulating them-</p><p>selves that the Golden Age had come again, it wa3 </p><p>observed that the planet seemed ill at ease. P’is- </p><p>sures opened slowly in the crust, and carbonic acid </p><p>gas—the carbon dioxide of chemists—began to </p><p>pour out into the atmosphere. That gas had long </p><p>been known to be present in the air, and was con- </p><p>sidered necessary to plant life. Most of the plants </p><p>of the world took the gas and absorbed its carbon </p><p>into themselves, releasing the oxygen for use again. </p><p> Scientists had calculated that a great deal of the</p><p>earth’s increased fertility was due to the larger </p><p>quantities of carbon dioxide released by the activi- </p><p>ties of man in burning </p><p>his coal and petroleum. </p><p>Because of those views, </p><p>for some years no great </p><p>alarm was caused by the </p><p>continuous exhalation </p><p>from the world’s interior. </p><p> Constantly, however, the</p><p>volume increased. New </p><p>fissures constantly opened, </p><p>each one adding a new </p><p>source of carbon dioxide, </p><p>and each one pouring into </p><p>the already laden atmos- </p><p>phere more of the gas— </p><p>beneficent in small quanti- </p><p>ties, butastheworld learn- </p><p>—	ed, deadly in large ones.</p><p> The percentage of the</p><p>heavy, vapor-like gas increased. The whole body of </p><p>the air became heavier through its admixture. It </p><p>absorbed more moisture and became more humid. </p><p>Rainfall increased. Climates grew warmer. Vegeta- </p><p>tion became more luxuriant—but the air gradually </p><p>became less exhilarating. </p><p> Soon the health of mankind began to be affected.</p><p>Accustomed through long ages to breath air rich in </p><p>oxygen and poor in carbon dioxide, men suffered. </p><p>Only those who lived on high plateaus or on tall </p><p>mountain-tops remained unaffected. The plants of</p><p>that of a child, and there was but little hair upon the earth, though nourished and increasing in size </p><p>738 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>beyond those ever seen before, were unable to dispose </p><p>of the continually increasing flood of carbon dioxide </p><p>exhaled by the weary planet. </p><p> By the middle of the twenty-first century it was</p><p>generally recognized that a new carboniferous period </p><p>was about to come when the earth’s atmosphere </p><p>would be thick and humid, unbreathable by man, </p><p>when giant grasses and ferns would form the only </p><p>vegetation. </p><p> When the twenty-first century drew to a close</p><p>the whole human race began to revert to conditions </p><p>closely approximating savagery. The lowlands were </p><p>unbearable. Thick jungles of rank growth covered </p><p>the ground. The air was depressing and ennervat- </p><p>ing. Men could live there, but it was a sickly, fever- </p><p>ridden existence. The whole population of tho </p><p>earth desired the high lands, and as the low country </p><p>became more unbearable, men forgot their two </p><p>centuries of peace. </p><p> They fought destructively, each for a bit of land</p><p>where he might live and breathe. Then men began </p><p>to die, men who had persisted in remaining near </p><p>sea-level. They could not live in the poisonous air. </p><p>The danger zone crept up as the earth-fissures tire- </p><p>lessly poured out their steady streams of foul gas. </p><p>Soon men could not live within five hundred feet </p><p>of sea-level. The lowlands went uncultivated, and </p><p>became jungles of a thickness comparable only to </p><p>those of the first carboniferous period. </p><p> Then men died of sheer inanition at a thousand</p><p>feet. The plateaus and mountain-tops were crowded </p><p>with folk struggling for a foothold and food beyond </p><p>the invisible menace that crept up, and up— </p><p> These things did not take place in one year, or</p><p>in ten. Not in one generation, but in several. Be- </p><p>tween the time when the chemists of the Inter- </p><p>national Geophysical Institute announced that the </p><p>proportion of carbon dioxide in the air had increased </p><p>from .04 per cent to .1 per cent and the time when </p><p>at sea-level six per cent of the atmosphere was the </p><p>deadly gas, more than two hundred years intervened. </p><p> Coming gradually, as it did, the poisonous effects</p><p>of the deadly stuff increased with insidious slow- </p><p>ness. First the lassitude, then the heaviness of </p><p>brain, then the weakness of body. Mankind ceased </p><p>to grow in numbers. After a long period, the race </p><p>had fallen to a fraction of its former size. There </p><p>was room in plenty on the mountain-tops—but the </p><p>danger-level continued to creep up.</p><p> There was but one solution. The human body</p><p>would have to inure itself to the poison, or it was </p><p>doomed to extinction. It finally developed a tolera- </p><p>tion for the gas that had wiped out race after race </p><p>and nation after nation, but at a terrible cost. </p><p>Lungs increased in size to secure the oxygen on </p><p>which life depended, but the poison, inhaled at </p><p>every breath, left the few survivors sickly and filled </p><p>with a perpetual weariness. Their minds lacked </p><p>the energy to cope with new problems or transmit </p><p>the knowledge they possessed. </p><p> And after thirty thousand years, Burl, a direct</p><p>descendant of the first president of the Universal </p><p>Republic, crept through a forest of toadstools and </p><p>fungus growths. He was ignorant of fire, of metals, </p><p>of the uses of stone and wood. A single garment </p><p>was worn by him. His language was a scanty group </p><p>of a few hundred labial sounds, conveying no ab- </p><p>stractions and few concrete ideas. </p><p> He was ignorant of the uses of wood. There was</p><p>no wood in the scanty territory furtively inhabited </p><p>by his tribe. With the increase in heat and humidity </p><p>the trees had begun to die out. Those of northern </p><p>climes went first, the oaks, the cedars, the maples. </p><p>Then the pines—the beeches went early—the cypresses, </p><p>and finally even the forests of the jungles vanished. </p><p>Only grasses and reeds, bamboos and their kin, were </p><p>able to flourish in the new, steaming atmosphere. </p><p>The thick jungles gave place to dense thickets of </p><p>grasses and ferns, now become tree-ferns again. </p><p> And then the fungi took their place. Flourishing</p><p>as never before, flourishing on a planet of torrid </p><p>heat and perpetual miasma, on whose surface the </p><p>sun never shone directly because of an ever-thicken- </p><p>ing bank of clouds that hung sullenly overhead, the </p><p>fungi sprang up. About the dank pools that fest- </p><p>ered over the surface of the earth, fungus growths </p><p>began to cluster. Of every imaginable shade and </p><p>color, of all monstrous forms and malignant pur- </p><p>poses, of huge size and flabby volume, they spread </p><p>over the land. </p><p> The grasses and ferns gave place to them. Squat</p><p>toadstools, flaking molds, evil-smelling yeasts, vast </p><p>mounds of fungi inextricably mingled as to species, </p><p>but growing, forever growing and exhaling an odor </p><p>of dark places. </p><p> The strange growths now grouped themselves in</p><p>forests, horrible travesties on the vegetation they </p><p>had succeeded. They grew and grew with feverish </p><p>intensity beneath a clouded or a haze-obscured sky, </p><p>while above them fluttered gigantic butterflies and</p><p>huge moths, sipping daintily of their corruption. </p><p> The insects alone of all the animal world above</p><p>water, were able to endure the change. They multi- </p><p>plied exceedingly, and enlarged themselves in the </p><p>thickened air. The solitary vegetation—as distinct </p><p>from fungus growths—that had survived was now </p><p>a degenerate form of the cabbages that had once </p><p>fed peasants. On those rank, colossal masses of </p><p>foliage, the stolid grubs and caterpillars ate them- </p><p>selves to maturity, then swung below in strong </p><p>cocoons to sleep the sleep of metamorphosis from </p><p>which they emerged to spread their wings and fly. </p><p> The tiniest butterflies of former'days^had "in-</p><p>creased their span until their gaily colored wings </p><p>should be described in terras of feet, while the larger </p><p>emperor moths extended their purple sails to a </p><p>breadth of yards upon yards. Burl himself would </p><p>have been dwarfed beneath the overshadowing </p><p>fabric of their wings. </p><p> It was fortunate that they, the largest flying</p><p>creatures, were harmless or nearly so. Burl’s fel- </p><p>low tribesmen sometimes came upon a cocoon just </p><p>about to open, and waited patiently beside it until </p><p>the beautiful creature within broke through its </p><p>matted shell and came out into the sunlight. </p><p> Then, before it had gathered energy from the air,</p><p>and before its wings had swelled to strength and </p><p>firmness, the tribesmen fell upon it, tearing the </p><p>THE MAD PUANET </p><p>739 </p><p>filmy, delicate wings from its body and the limbs </p><p>from its carcass. Then, when it lay helpless before </p><p>them, they carried away the juicy, meat-filled limbs </p><p>to be eaten, leaving the still living body to stare </p><p>helplessly at this strange world through its many- </p><p>faceted eyes and become a prey to the voracious </p><p>ants who would soon clamber upon it, and carry it </p><p>away in tiny fragments to their underground city. </p><p> Not all the insect world was so helpless or so</p><p>unthreatening. Burl knew of wasps almost the </p><p>length of his own body who possessed stings that </p><p>were instantly fatal. To every species of wasp, </p><p>however, some other insect is predestined prey, and </p><p>the furtive members of Burl’s tribe feared them </p><p>but little, as they sought only, the prey to which </p><p>their instinct led them. </p><p> Bees were similarly aloof. They were hard put</p><p>to it for existence, those bees. Few flowers bloomed, </p><p>and they were reduced to expedients once considered </p><p>signs of degeneracy in their race. They gathered </p><p>bubbling yeasts and fouler things, occasionally from </p><p>the nectarless blooms of the rank, giant cabbages. </p><p>Burl knew the bees. They droned over, nearly as </p><p>large as he was himself, their bulging eyes gazing </p><p>at him with abstracted preoccupation. And crickets, </p><p>and beetles, and spiders— </p><p> Burl knew spiders! His grandfather had been</p><p>the prey of one of the hunting tarantulas, which had </p><p>leaped with incredible ferocity from his excavated </p><p>tunnel in the earth. A vertical pit in the ground, two </p><p>feet in diameter, went down for twenty feet. At </p><p>the bottom of that lair the black-bellied monster </p><p>waited for the tiny sounds that would warn him of </p><p>prey approaching his hiding-place. (Lycosa fas- </p><p>data). </p><p> Burl’s grandfather had been careless, and the</p><p>terrible shrieks he uttered as the horrible monster </p><p>darted from the pit and seized him had lingered </p><p>vaguely in Burl’s mind ever since. Burl Tiad seen, </p><p>too, the monster webs of another species of spider, </p><p>and watched from a safe distance as the misshapen </p><p>body of the huge creature sucked the juices from </p><p>a three-foot cricket that had become entangled in </p><p>its trap. </p><p> Burl had remembered the strange stripes of</p><p>yellow and black and silver that crossed upon its </p><p>abdomen. (Eyiera fasciata). He had been fas- </p><p>cinated by the struggles of the imprisoned insect, </p><p>coiled in a hopeless tangle of sticky, gummy ropes </p><p>the thickness of Burl’s finger, cast about its body</p><p>before the spider made any attempt to approach. </p><p> Burl knew these dangers. They were a part of</p><p>his life. It was his accustomedness to them, and </p><p>that of his ancestors, that made his existence pos- </p><p>sible. He was able to evade them; so he survived. </p><p>A moment of carelessness, an instant’s relaxation </p><p>of his habitual caution, and .he would be one with </p><p>his forebears, forgotten meals of long-dead, inhuman </p><p>monsters. </p><p> Three days before, Burl had crouched behind a</p><p>bulky, shapeless fungus growth while he watched </p><p>a furious duel between two huge horned beetles. </p><p>Their jaws, gaping wide, clicked and clashed upon </p><p>each others’ impenetrable armor. Their legs </p><p>crashed like so many cymbals as their polished sur- </p><p>faces ground and struck against each other. They </p><p>were fighting over some particularly attractive bit </p><p>of carrion. </p><p> Burl had watched with all his eyes until a gaping</p><p>orifice appeared in the armor of the smaller of the </p><p>two. It uttered a shrill cry, or seemed to cry out. </p><p>The noise was actually the tearing of the horny </p><p>stuff beneath the victorious jaws of the adversary. </p><p>The wounded beetle struggled more and more </p><p>feebly. At last it collapsed, and the conqueror </p><p>placidly began to eat the conquered before life was </p><p>extinct. </p><p> Burl waited until the meal was finished, and then</p><p>approached the scene with caution. An ant—the </p><p>forerunner of many—was already inspecting the </p><p>carcass. </p><p> Burl usually ignored the ants. They were stupid,</p><p>short-sighted insects, and not hunters. Save when </p><p>attacked, they offered no injury. They were scaven- </p><p>gers, on the look-out for the dead and dying, but </p><p>they would fight viciously if their prey were ques- </p><p>tioned, and they were dangerous opponents. They </p><p>were from three inches in length for the tiny black </p><p>ants, to a foot for the large termites. </p><p> Burl was hasty when he heard the tiny clickings</p><p>of their limbs as they approached. He seized the </p><p>sharp-pointed snout of the victim, detached from </p><p>the body, and fled from the scene. </p><p> Later, he inspected his find with curiosity. The</p><p>smaller victim had been a Minotaur beetle, with a </p><p>sharp-pointed horn like that of a rhinoceros to re- </p><p>inforce his offensive armament, already dangerous </p><p>because of his wide jaws. The jaws of a beetle </p><p>work from side to side, instead of up and down, </p><p>and this had made the protection complete in no</p><p>less than three directions. </p><p> Burl inspected the sharp, danger-like instrument</p><p>in his hand. He felt its point, and it pricked his </p><p>finger. He flung it aside as he crept to the hiding- </p><p>place of his tribe. There were only twenty of them, </p><p>four or five men, six or seven women, and the rest </p><p>girls and children. </p><p> Burl had been wondering at the strange feel-</p><p>ings that came over him when he looked at one of </p><p>the girls. She was younger than Burl—perhaps </p><p>eighteen—and fleeter of foot than he. They talked </p><p>together, sometimes, and once or twice Burl shared </p><p>with her an especially succulent find of foodstuffs. </p><p> The next mprning he found the horn where he</p><p>had thrown it, sticking in the flabby side of a toad- </p><p>stool. He pulled it out, and gradually, far back in </p><p>his mind, an idea began to take shape. He sat for </p><p>some time with the thing in his hand, considering it </p><p>with a far-away look in his eyes. From time to </p><p>time he stabbed at a toadstool, awkwardly, but with </p><p>gathering skill. His 'imagination began to work </p><p>fitfully. He visualized himself stabbing food with </p><p>it as the larger beetle had stabbed the former owner </p><p>of the weapon in his hand. </p><p> Burl could not imagine himself coping with one</p><p>of the fighting insects. He could only picture him- </p><p>self, dimly, stabbing something that was food with </p><p>this death-dealing thing. It was longer than his </p><p>740 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>arm and though clumsy to the hand, an effective and </p><p>terribly sharp implement. </p><p> He thought. Where was there food, food that</p><p>lived, that would not fight back? Presently he </p><p>rose and began to make his way toward the tiny </p><p>river. Ydlow-bellied newts swam in its waters. </p><p>The swimming larvze of a thousand insects floated </p><p>about its surface or crawled upon its bottom. </p><p> There were deadly things there, too. Giant</p><p>crayfish snapped their horny claws at the unwary. </p><p>Mosquitoes of four-inch wing-spread sometimes </p><p>made their humming way above the river. The last </p><p>survivors of their race, they were dying out for </p><p>lack of the plant-juices on which the male of the </p><p>species lived, but even so they were formidable. </p><p>Burl had learned to crush them with fragments of </p><p>fungus. </p><p> He crept slowly through the forest of toadstools.</p><p>Brownish fungus was underfoot. Strange orange, </p><p>red, and purple molds clustered about the bases </p><p>of the creamy toadstool stalks. Once Burl paused </p><p>to run his sharp-pointed weapon through a fleshy </p><p>stalk and reassure himself that what he planned was </p><p>practicable. </p><p> He made his way furtively through the forest of</p><p>misshapen growths. Once he heard a tiny clicking, </p><p>and froze into stillness. It was a troop of four or </p><p>five ants, each some eight inches long, returning </p><p>along their habitual pathway to their city. They </p><p>moved sturdily, heavily laden, along the route </p><p>marked with the odorous formic acid exuded from </p><p>the bodies of their comrades. Burl waited until </p><p>they had passed, then went on. </p><p> He came to the bank of the river. Green scum</p><p>covered a great deal of its surface, scum occasionally </p><p>broken by a slowly enlarging bubble of some gas </p><p>released from decomposing matter on the bottom. </p><p>In the center of the placid stream the current ran </p><p>a little more swiftly, and the water itself was visible. </p><p> Over the shining current water-spiders ran swift-</p><p>ly. They had not shared in the general increase </p><p>of size that had taken place in the insect world. </p><p>Depending upon the capillary qualities of the water </p><p>to support them, an increase in size and weight </p><p>would have deprived them of the means of locomo- </p><p>tion. </p><p> From the spot where Burl first peered at the</p><p>water the green scum spread out for many yards</p><p>into the stream. He could not see what swam and </p><p>wriggled and crawled beneath the evil-smelling </p><p>covering. He peered up and down the banks. </p><p> Perhaps a hundred and fifty yards below, the</p><p>current came near the shore. An out-cropping of </p><p>rock there made a steep descent to the river, from </p><p>which yellow shelf-fungi stretched out. Dark-red </p><p>and orange above, they were light-yellow below, and </p><p>they formed a series of platforms above the </p><p>smoothly flowing stream. Burl made his way </p><p>cautiously toward them. </p><p> On his way he saw one of the edible mushrooms</p><p>that formed so large a part of his diet, and paused </p><p>to break from the flabby flesh an amount that would </p><p>feed him for many days. It w^s too often the cus- </p><p>tom of his people to find a store of food, carry it to </p><p>their hiding-place, and then gorge themselves for </p><p>days, eating, sleeping, and waking only to eat again </p><p>until the food was gone. </p><p> Absorbed as he was in his plan of trying his new</p><p>weapon, Burl was tempted to return with his booty. </p><p>He would give Saya of this food, and they would </p><p>eat together. Saya was the maiden who roused un- </p><p>usual emotions in Burl. He felt strange impulses </p><p>stirring within him when she was near, a desire to </p><p>touch her, to caress her. He did not understand. </p><p> He went on, after hesitating. If he brought her</p><p>food, Saya would be pleased, but if he brought her </p><p>of the things that swam in the stream, she would </p><p>be still more pleased. Degraded as his tribe had </p><p>become, Burl was yet a little more intelligent than </p><p>they. He was an atavism, a throwback to ancestors </p><p>who had cultivated the earth and subjugated its </p><p>animals. He had a vague idea of pride, unformed </p><p>but potent. </p><p> No man within memory had hunted or slain for</p><p>food. They knew of meat, yes, but it had been the </p><p>fragments left by an insect-hunter, seized and </p><p>carried away by the men before the perpetually alert </p><p>ant-colonies had sent their foragers to the scene. </p><p> If Burl did what no man before him had done,</p><p>if he brought a whole carcass to his tribe, they </p><p>would envy him. They were preoccupied solely </p><p>with their stomachs, and after that with the pre- </p><p>servation of their lives. The perpetuation of the </p><p>race came third in their consideration. </p><p> They were herded together in a leaderless group,</p><p>coming to the same hiding-place that they might </p><p>share in the finds of the lucky and gather comfort </p><p>from their numbers. Of weapons, they had none.</p><p>They sometimes used stones to crack open the </p><p>limbs of the huge insects they found partly de- </p><p>voured, cracking them open for the sweet meat to </p><p>be found inside, but they sought safety from their </p><p>enemies solely in flight and hiding. </p><p> Their enemies were not as numerous as might</p><p>have been imagined. Most of the meat-eating in- </p><p>sects have their allotted prey. The sphex—a hunt- </p><p>ing wasp—feeds solely upon grasshoppers. Other </p><p>wasps eat fires only. The pirate-bee eats bumble- </p><p>bees only. Spiders were the principal enemies of </p><p>man, as they devour with a terrifying impartiality </p><p>all that falls into their clutches. </p><p> Burl reached the spot from which he might gaze</p><p>down into the water. He lay prostrate, staring into </p><p>the shallow depths. Once a huge crayfish, as long </p><p>as Burl’s body, moved leisurely across his vision. </p><p>Small fishes and even the huge newts fled before </p><p>the voracious creature. </p><p> After a long time the tide of underwater life</p><p>resumed its activity. The wriggling grubs of the </p><p>dragon-flies reappeared. Little flecks of silver swam </p><p>into view—a school of tiny fish. A larger fish ap- </p><p>peared, moving slowly through the water. </p><p> Burl’s eyes glistened and his mouth watered.</p><p>He reached down with his long weapon. It barely </p><p>touched the water. Disappointment filled him, yet </p><p>the nearness and the apparent practicability of his </p><p>scheme spurred him on. </p><p> He considered the situation. There were the</p><p>shelf-fungi below him. He rose and moved to a </p><p>THE MAD PLANET </p><p>741 </p><p>point just above them, then thrust his spear down. </p><p>They resisted its point. Burl felt them tentatively </p><p>■with his foot, then dared to thrust his weight to </p><p>them. They held him firmly. He clambered down </p><p>and lay flat upon them, peering over the edge as </p><p>before. </p><p> The large fish, as long as Burl's arm, swam slowly</p><p>to and fro below him. Burl had seen the former </p><p>owner of his spear strive to thrust it into his op- </p><p>ponents, and knew that a thrust was necessary. </p><p>He had tried his weapon upon toadstools—had prac- </p><p>tised with it. When the fish swam below him, he </p><p>thrust sharply downward. The spear seemed to </p><p>bend when it entered the water, and missed its </p><p>mark by inches, to Burl’s astonishment. He tried </p><p>again and again. </p><p> He grew angry with the fish below him for elud-</p><p>ing his efforts to kill it. Repeated strokes had left </p><p>it untouched, and it was unwary, and did not even </p><p>try to run away. </p><p> Burl became furious. The big fish came to rest</p><p>directly beneath his hand. Burl thrust downward </p><p>with all his strength. This time the spear, enter- </p><p>ing vertically, did not seem to bend. It went </p><p>straight down. Its point penetrated the scales of </p><p>the swimmer below, transfixing that lazy fish com- </p><p>pletely. </p><p> An uproar began. The fish, struggling to escape,</p><p>and Burl, trying to draw it up to his perch, made </p><p>a huge commotion. In his excitement Burl did not </p><p>observe a tiny ripple some distance away. The </p><p>monster crayfish was attracted by the disturbance </p><p>and was approaching. </p><p> The unequal combat continued. Burl hung on</p><p>desperately to the end of his spear. Then there was </p><p>a tremor in Burl’s support, it gave way, and fell </p><p>into the stream with a mighty splash. Burl went </p><p>under, his eyes open, facing death. And as he </p><p>sank, his wide-open eyes saw waved before him the </p><p>gaping claws of the huge crayfish, large enough to </p><p>sever a limb with a. single stroke of their jagged </p><p>jaws. </p><p>CHAPTER II. </p><p>The Black-Bellied Spider </p><p>HE opened his mouth to scream, a replica of </p><p>the terrible screams of his grandfather, </p><p>seized by a black-bellied tarantula years</p><p>before, but no sound came forth. Only bubbles </p><p>floated to the surface of the water. He beat the </p><p>unresisting fluid with his hands—he did not know </p><p>how to swim. The colossal creature approached </p><p>leisurely, while Burl struggled helplessly. </p><p> His arms struck a solid object, and grasped it</p><p>convulsively. A second later he had swung it be- </p><p>tween himself and thc huge crustacean. He felt </p><p>a shock as the mighty jaws closed upon the cork- </p><p>like fungus, then felt himself drawn upward as the </p><p>crayfish released his hold and the shelf-fungus float- </p><p>ed to the surface. Having given way beneath him, </p><p>it had been carried below him in his fall, only to </p><p>rise within his reach just when most needed. </p><p> Burl’s head popped above water and he saw a</p><p>larger bit of the fungus floating near by. Less se- </p><p>curely anchored to the rocks of the river-bank than </p><p>the shelf to which Burl had trusted himself, it had </p><p>been dislodged when the first shelf gave away. It </p><p>was larger than the fragment to which Burl clung, </p><p>and floated higher in the water. </p><p> Burl was cool with a terrible self possession. He</p><p>seized it and struggled to draw himself on top of </p><p>it. It tilted as his weight came upon it, and nearly </p><p>overturned, but he paid no heed. With desperate </p><p>haste, he clawed with hands and feet until he could </p><p>draw himself clear of the water, of which he would </p><p>forever retain a slight fear. </p><p> As he pulled himself upon the furry, orange-</p><p>brown upper surface, a sharp blow struck his foot. </p><p>The crayfish, disgusted at finding only what was </p><p>to it a tasteless morsel in the shelf-fungus, had </p><p>made a languid stroke at Burl’s wriggling foot in </p><p>the water. Failing to grasp the fleshy member, the </p><p>crayfish retreated, disgruntled and annoyed. </p><p> And Burl floated down-stream, perched, weapon-</p><p>less and alone, frightened and in constant danger, </p><p>upon a flimsy raft composed of a degenerate fungus, </p><p>floating slowly down the stream of a river in whose </p><p>waters death lurked unseen, upon whose banks was </p><p>peril, and above whose reaches danger fluttered on </p><p>golden wings. </p><p> It was a long time before he recovered his</p><p>self-possession, and when he did he looked first for </p><p>his spear. It was floating in the water, still trans- </p><p>fixing the fish whose capture had endangered Burl’s </p><p>life. The fish now floated with its belly upward, all </p><p>life gone. </p><p> So insistent was Burl’s instinct for food that his</p><p>predicament was forgotten when he saw his prey</p><p>just out of his reach. He gazed at it, and his </p><p>mouth watered, while his cranky craft went down- </p><p>stream, spinning slowly in the current. He lay </p><p>flat on the floating fungoid, and strove to reach </p><p>out and grasp the end of the spear. </p><p> The raft tilted and nearly flung him overboard</p><p>again. A little later he discovered that it sank </p><p>more readily 011 one side than on the other. That </p><p>was due, of course, to the greater thickness—and </p><p>consequently greater buoyancy—of the part which </p><p>had grown next the rocks of the river-bank. </p><p> Burl found that if he lay with his head stretch-</p><p>ing above that side, it did not sink into the water. </p><p>He wriggled into this new position, then, and waited </p><p>until the slow revolution of his vessel brought the </p><p>spear-shaft near him. He stretched his fingers </p><p>and his arm, and touched, then grasped it. </p><p> A moment later he was tearing strips of flesh</p><p>from the side of the fish and cramming the oily </p><p>mess into his mouth with great enjoyment. He </p><p>had lost his edible mushroom. That danced upon </p><p>the waves several yards away, but Burl ate con- </p><p>tentedly of what he possessed. He did not worry </p><p>about what was before him. That lay in the future, </p><p>but suddenly he realized that he was being carried </p><p>farther and farther from Saya, the maiden of his </p><p>tribe who caused strange bliss to steal over him </p><p>when he contemplated her. </p><p> The thought came to him when he visualized the</p><p>delight with which she would receive a gift of part </p><p>of the fish he had caught. He was suddenly stricken </p><p>with dumb sorrow. He lifted his head and looked </p><p>longingly at the river banks. </p><p> A long, monotonous row of strangely colored</p><p>fungus growths. No healthy green, but pallid, </p><p>cream-colored toadstools, some bright orange, </p><p>lavender, and purple molds, vivid carmine “rusts" </p><p>742 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>and mildews, spreading up the banks from the </p><p>turgid slime. The sun was not a ball of fire, but </p><p>merely shone as a bright golden patch in the haze- </p><p>filled sky, a patch whose limits could not be defined </p><p>or marked. </p><p> In the faintly pinkish light that filtered down</p><p>through the air a multitude of flying objects could </p><p>be seen. Now and then a cricket or a grasshopper </p><p>made its bullet-like flight from one spot to another. </p><p>Huge butterflies fluttered gayly above the silent, </p><p>seemingly lifeless world. Bees lumbered anxiously </p><p>about, seeking the cross-shaped flowers of the </p><p>monster cabbages. Now and then a slender-waisted, </p><p>yellow-stomached wasp flew alertly through the air. </p><p> Burl watched them with a strange indifference.</p><p>The wasps were as long as himself. The bees, on </p><p>end, could match his height. The butterflies ranged, </p><p>from tiny creatures barely capable of shading his </p><p>face, to colossal things in the folds of whose wings </p><p>he could have been lost. And above him fluttered </p><p>dragon-flies, whose long, spindle-like bodies were </p><p>three times the length of his own. </p><p> Burl ignored them all. Sitting there, an incon-</p><p>gruous creature of pink skin and soft brown hair </p><p>upon an orange fungus floating in midstream, he </p><p>was filled with despondency because the current </p><p>carried him forever farther and farther from a </p><p>certain slender-limbed maiden of his tiny tribe, </p><p>whose glances caused an odd commotion in his </p><p>breast. </p><p> The day went on. Once, Burl saw upon the</p><p>blue-green mold that there spread upward from the </p><p>river, a band of large, red, Amazon ants, marching </p><p>in orderly array, to raid the city of a colony of </p><p>black ants, and carry away the eggs they would </p><p>fhid there. The eggs would be hatched, and the </p><p>small black' creatures made the slaves of the bri- </p><p>gands who had stolen them. </p><p> The Amazon ants can live only by the labor of</p><p>their slaves, and for that reason are mighty war- </p><p>riors in their world. Later, etched against the </p><p>steaming mist that overhung everything as far as </p><p>the eye could reach, Burl saw strangely shaped, </p><p>swollen branches rearing themselves from the </p><p>ground. He knew what they were. A hard-rinded </p><p>fungus that grew upon itself in peculiar mockery </p><p>of the vegetation that had vanished from the earth. </p><p> And again he saw pear-shaped objects above</p><p>some of which floated little clouds of smoke. They,</p><p>too, were fungus growths, puffballs, which when </p><p>touched emit what seems a puff of vapor. These </p><p>would have towered above Burl’s head, had he stood </p><p>beside them. </p><p> And then, as the day drew to an end, he saw</p><p>in the distance what seemed a range of purple hills. </p><p>They were tall hills to Burl, some sixty or seventy </p><p>feet high, and they seemed to be the agglomeration </p><p>of a formless growth, multiplying its organisms </p><p>and forms upon itself until the whole formed an </p><p>irregular, cone-shaped mound. Burl watched them </p><p>apathetically. </p><p> Presently, he ate again of the oily fish. The</p><p>taste was pleasant to him, accustomed to feed </p><p>mostly upon insipid mushrooms. He stuffed him- </p><p>self, though the size of his prey left by far the </p><p>larger part still un-eaten. </p><p> He still held his spear firmly beside him. It had</p><p>brought him Into trouble, but Burl possessed § </p><p>fund of obstinacy. Unlike most of his tribe, he </p><p>associated the spear with the food it had secured, </p><p>rather than with the difficulty into which it had led </p><p>him. When he had eaten his fill he picked it up </p><p>and examined it again. The sharpness of its point </p><p>was unimpaired. </p><p> Burl handled it meditatively, debating whether</p><p> or not to attempt to fish again. The shakiness of</p><p> his little raft dissuaded him, and he abandoned the</p><p> idea. Presently he stripped a sinew from the gar-</p><p> ment about his middle and hung the fish about his</p><p> neck with it. That would leave him both hands</p><p> free. Then he sat cross-legged upon the soggily</p><p> floating fungus, like a pink-skinned Buddha, and</p><p> watched the shores go by.</p><p> Time had passed, and it was drawing near sun-</p><p> set. Burl, never having seen the sun save as a</p><p> bright spot in the overhanging haze, did not think</p><p> of the coming of night as “sunset.” To him it was</p><p> the letting down of darkness from the sky.</p><p> To-day happened to be an exceptionally bright</p><p> day, and the haze was not as thick as usual. Far</p><p> to the west, the thick mist turned to gold, while</p><p> , the thicker clouds above became blurred masses of</p><p> dull-red. Their shadows seemed like lavender from</p><p> the contrast of shades. Upon the still surface of the</p><p> river, all the myriad tints and shadings were re-</p><p> flected with an incredible faithfulness, and the</p><p> shining tops of the giant mushrooms by the river</p><p> brim glowed faintly pink.</p><p> Dragonflies buzzed over his head in their swift</p><p> and angular flight, the metallic luster of their bodies</p><p> glistening in the rosy light. Great yellow butter-</p><p> flies flew lightly above the stream. Here, there, and</p><p> everywhere upon the water appeared the shell-</p><p> formed boats of a thousand caddis flies, floating</p><p> upon the surface while they might.</p><p> Burl could have thrust his hand down into their</p><p> cavities and seized the white worms that inhabited</p><p> the strange craft. The huge bulk of a tardy bee</p><p> droned heavily overhead. Burl glanced upward</p><p> and saw the long proboscis and the hairy hinder</p><p> legs with their scanty load of pollen. He saw the</p><p> great, multiple-lensed eyes with their expression of</p><p> stupid preoccupation, and even the sting that would</p><p> mean death alike for him and for the giant insect,</p><p> should it be used.</p><p> The crimson radiance grew dim at the edge of</p><p> the world. The purple hills had long been left be-</p><p> hind. Now the slender stalks of ten thousand</p><p> round-domed mushrooms lined the river-bank, and</p><p> beneath them spread fungi of all colors, from the</p><p> rawest red to palest blue, but all now fading slowly</p><p> to a monochromatic background in the growing</p><p> dusk.</p><p> The buzzing, fluttering, and the flapping of the</p><p> insects of the day died slowly down, while from</p><p> a million hiding-places there crept out into the</p><p> deep night soft and furry bodies of great moths,</p><p> who preened themselves and smoothed their feathery</p><p> antenna before taking to the air. The strong-</p><p> limbed crickets set up their thunderous noise—</p><p> grown gravely bass with the increasing size of the</p><p> organs by which the sound was made—and then</p><p> there began to gather on the water those slender</p><p> spirals of tenuous mist that would presently blanket</p><p> the stream in a mantle of thin fog.</p><p> Night fell, ,The clouds above seemed to lower and</p><p>THE MAD PLANET </p><p>743 </p><p> grow dark. Gradually, now a drop and then a drop,</p><p> the languid fall of large, warm raindrops that would</p><p> drip from the moisture-laden skies all through the</p><p> night began. The edge of the stream became a</p><p> place where great disks of coolly glowing flame</p><p> appeared.</p><p> The mushrooms that bordered on the river were</p><p>faintly phosphoi*escent {Pleurotus phosphor eus) </p><p>and shone coldly upon the “rusts” and flake-fungi </p><p>beneath their feet. Here and there a ball of lam- </p><p>bent flame appeared, drifting idly above the steam- </p><p>ing, festering earth. </p><p> Thirty thousand years before, men had called</p><p>them “will-o'-the-wisps,” but Burl simply stared at </p><p>them, accepting them as he accepted all that passed. </p><p>Only a man attempting to advance in the scale of </p><p>civilization tries to explain everything that he sees. </p><p>The savage and the child are most often content </p><p>to observe without comment, unless the legends </p><p>told by wise folk who are possesed by the itch of </p><p>knowledge are repeated to them. </p><p> Burl watched for a long time. Great fireflies</p><p>whose beacons lighted up their surroundings for </p><p>many yards—fireflies Burl knew to be as long as his </p><p>spear—great fireflies shed their intermittent glows </p><p>upon the stream. Softly fluttering wings, in great </p><p>beats that poured torrents of air upon him, passed </p><p>above Burl. </p><p> The air was full of winged creatures. The night</p><p>was broken by their cries, by the sound of their </p><p>invisible wings, by their cries of anguish and their </p><p>mating calls. Above him and on all sides the per- </p><p>sistent, intense life of the insect world went on </p><p>ceaselessly, but Burl rocked back and forth upon </p><p>his frail mushroom boat and wished to weep be- </p><p>cause he was being carried from his tribe, and from </p><p>Saya—Saya of the swift feet and white teeth, of </p><p>the shy smile. </p><p> Burl may have been homesick, "but his principal</p><p>thoughts were of Saya. He had dared greatly to </p><p>bring a gift of fresh meat to her, meat captured </p><p>as meat had never been known to be taken by a </p><p>member of the tribe. And now he was “being carried </p><p>from her! </p><p> He lay, disconsolate, upon his floating atom on</p><p>the water for a great part of the night. It was long </p><p>after midnight when the mushroom raft struck </p><p>gently and remained grounded upon a shallow in </p><p>the stream.</p><p> When the light came in the morning, Burl gazed</p><p>about him keenly. He Was some twenty yards from </p><p>the shore, and the greenish scum surrounded his </p><p>now disintegrating vessel. The river had widened </p><p>out until the other bank was barely to be seen </p><p>through the haze above the surface of the river, but </p><p>the nearer shore seemed firm and no more full of </p><p>dangers than the territory his tribe inhabited. He </p><p>felt the depth of the water with his spear, then was </p><p>struck with the multiple usefulness of that weapon. </p><p>The water would come but slightly above his ankles. </p><p> Shivering a little with fear, Burl stepped down</p><p>into the water, then made for the bank at the top </p><p>of his speed. He felt a soft something clinging to </p><p>one of his bare feet. With an access of terror, he </p><p>ran faster, and stumbled upon the shore in a panic. </p><p>He stared down at his foot. A shapeless, flesh- </p><p>colored pad clung to his heel, and, as Burl watched, </p><p>it began to swell slowly, while the pink of its </p><p>wrinkled folds deepened. </p><p> It was no more than a leech, sharing in the en-</p><p>largement nearly all the lower world had under- </p><p>gone, but Burl did not know that. He thrust at it </p><p>with the side of his spear, then scraped frantically </p><p>at it, and it fell off, leaving a blotch of blood upon </p><p>the skin where it came away. It lay, writhing and </p><p>pulsating upon the ground, and Burl fled from it. </p><p> He found himself in one of the toadstool forests</p><p>with which he was familiar, and finally paused, </p><p>disconsolately. He knew the nature of the fungus </p><p>growth about him, and presently fell to eating. In </p><p>Burl the sight of food always produced hunger—a </p><p>wise provision of nature to make up for the in- </p><p>stinct to store food, which he lacked. </p><p> Burl’s heart was small within him. He was far</p><p>from his tribe, and far from Saya. In the par- </p><p>lance of this day, it is probable that no more than </p><p>forty miles, separated them, but Burl did not think </p><p>of distances. He had come down the river. He was </p><p>in a land he had never known or seen. And he was </p><p>alone. </p><p> All about him was food. All the mushrooms that</p><p>surrounded him were edible, and formed a store of </p><p>sustenance Burl’s whole tribe could not have eaten </p><p>in many days, but that very fact brought Saya to </p><p>his mind more forcibly. Pie squatted on the ground, </p><p>wolfing down the insipid mushroom in great gulps, </p><p>when an idea suddenly came to him with all the </p><p>force of inspiration. </p><p> He would bring Saya here, where there was food,</p><p>food in great quantities, and she would be pleased. </p><p>Burl had forgotten the large and oily fish that still </p><p>hung down his back from the sinew about his neck, </p><p>but now he rose, and its flapping against him re- </p><p>minded him again. </p><p> He took and fingered it all over, getting his hands</p><p>and himself thoroughly greasy in the process, but </p><p>he could eat no more. The thought of Saya’s pleas- </p><p>ure at the sight of that, too, reinforced his deter- </p><p>mination. </p><p> With all the immediacy of a child or a savage he</p><p>set off at once. lie had come along the bank of the </p><p>stream. He would retrace his steps along the bank </p><p>of the stream. </p><p> Through the awkward aisles of the mushroom</p><p>forest he made his way, eyes and ears open for </p><p>possibilities of danger. Several times he heard the </p><p>omnipresent clicking of ants on their multifarious </p><p>businesses in the wood, but he could afford to </p><p>ignore them. They were foragers rather than hun- </p><p>ters. He only feared one land of ant, the army-ant, </p><p>which sometimes travels in hordes of millions, eat- </p><p>ing all that it comes upon. In ages past, when they </p><p>were tiny creatures not an inch long, even the </p><p>largest animals fled from them. Now that they </p><p>measured a foot in length, not even the gorged </p><p>spiders whose distended bellies were a yard in </p><p>thickness, dared offer them battle. </p><p> The mushroom-forest came to an end. A cheerful</p><p>grasshopper (Ephigger) munched delicately at some </p><p>dainty it had found. Its hind legs were bunched </p><p>beneath it in perpetual readiness for flight. A </p><p>monster wasp appeared above—as long as Burl him- </p><p>self—poised aii instant, dropped, and seized the </p><p>luckless feaster. </p><p> There was a struggle, then the grasshopper be-</p><p>744 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>came helpless, and the wasp’s flexible abdomen </p><p>curved delicately. Its sting entered the jointed ar- </p><p>mor of its prey, just beneath the head. The sting </p><p>entered with all the deliberate precision of a sur- </p><p>geon’s scalpel, and all struggle ceased. </p><p> The wasp grasped the palalyzed, not dead, insect</p><p>and flew away. Burl grunted, and passed on. He </p><p>had hidden when the wasp darted down from above. </p><p> The ground grew rough and Burl’s progress be-</p><p>came painful. He clambered arduously up steep </p><p>slopes and made his way cautiously down their </p><p>farther sides. Once he had to climb through a </p><p>tangled mass of mushrooms so closely placed, and so </p><p>small, that he had to break them apart with blows </p><p>of his spear before he could pass, when they shed </p><p>upon him torrents of a fiery-red liquid that rolled </p><p>off his greasy breast and sank into the ground </p><p>(Lactarius deliciosus). </p><p> A strange self-confidence now took possession of</p><p>Burl. He walked less cautiously and more boldly. </p><p>The mere fact that he had struck something and </p><p>destroyed it provided him with a curious fictitious </p><p>courage. </p><p> He had climbed slowly to the top of a red-clay</p><p>cliff, perhaps a hundred feet high, slowly eaten </p><p>away by the river when it overflowed. Burl could </p><p>see the river. At some past flood-time it had lapped </p><p>at the base of the cliff on whose edge he walked, </p><p>though now it came no nearer than a quarter-mile. </p><p> The cliffside was almost covered with shelf-fungi,</p><p>large and small, white, yellow, orange, and green, in </p><p>indescribable confusion and luxuriance. From a </p><p>point halfway up the cliff the inch-thick cable of a </p><p>spider’s web stretched down to an anchorage on </p><p>the ground, and the strangely geometrical pattern </p><p>of the web glistened evilly. </p><p> Somewhere among the fungi of the cliffside the</p><p>huge creature waited until some unfortunate prey </p><p>should struggle helplessly in its monster snare. The </p><p>spider waited in a motionless, implacable patience, </p><p>invincibly certain of prey, utterly merciless to its </p><p>victims. </p><p> Burl strutted on the edge of the cliff, a silly little</p><p>pink-skinned creature with an oily fish slung about </p><p>his neck and a draggled fragment of a moth’s wing </p><p>about his middle. In his hand he bore the long spear </p><p>of a minotaur beetle. He strutted, and looked </p><p>scornfully down upon the whitely shining trap be-</p><p>low him. He struck mushrooms, and they had </p><p>fallen before him. He feared nothing. He strode </p><p>fearlessly along. He would go to Saya and bring </p><p>her to this land where food grew in abundance. </p><p> Sixty paces before him, a shaft sank vertically</p><p>in the sandy, clayey soil. It was a carefully rounded </p><p>shaft, and lined with silk. It went down for per- </p><p>haps thirty feet or more, and there enlarged itself </p><p>into a chamber where the owner and digger of the </p><p>shaft might rest. The top of the hole was closed </p><p>by a trap-door, stained with mud and earth to </p><p>imitate with precision the surrounding soil. A </p><p>keen eye would have been needed to perceive the </p><p>opening. But a keen eye now peered out from a </p><p>tiny crack, the eye of the engineer of the under- </p><p>ground dwelling. </p><p> Eight hairy legs surrounded the body of the</p><p>creature that hung motionless at the top of the silk- </p><p>lined Shaft. A huge misshapen globe formed its </p><p>body, colored a dirty brown. Two pairB of ferocious </p><p>mandibles stretched before its fierce mouth parts. </p><p>Two eyes glittered evilly in the darkness of the bur- </p><p>row. And over the whole body spread a rough, </p><p>mangy fur. </p><p> It was a thing of implacable malignance, of in-</p><p>credible ferocity. It was the brown hunting-spider, </p><p>the American tarantula {Mygale Hentzii). Its </p><p>body was two feet and more in diameter, and its </p><p>legs, outstretched, would cover a circle three yards </p><p>across. It watched Burl, its eyes glistening. Slaver </p><p>welled up and dropped from its jaws. </p><p> And Burl strutted forward on the edge of the cliff,</p><p>puffed up with a sense of his own importance. The </p><p>white snare of the spinning spider below him im- </p><p>pressed him as amusing. He knew the spider would </p><p>not leave its web to attack him. He reached down </p><p>and broke off a bit of fungus growing at his feet. </p><p>Where he broke it, it was oozing a soupy liquid </p><p>and was full of tiny maggots in a delirium of feast- </p><p>ing. Burl flung it down into the web, and then </p><p>laughed as the black bulk of the hidden spider </p><p>swung down from its hiding-place to investigate. </p><p> The tarantula, peering from its burrow, quivered</p><p>with impatience. Burl drew near, and nearer. He </p><p>was using his spear as a lever, now, and prying off </p><p>bits of fungus to fall down the cliffside into the </p><p>colossal web. The spider, below, went leisurely from </p><p>one place t,o another, investigating each new missile </p><p>with its palpi, then leaving them as they appeared </p><p>lifeless and undesirable prey. Burl laughed again </p><p>as a particularly large lump of shelf-fungus nar- </p><p>rowly missed the black-and-silver figure below.</p><p>Then— </p><p> The trap-door fell into place with a faint click, and</p><p>Burl whirled about. His laughter turned to a </p><p>scream. Moving toward him with incredible rapid- </p><p>ity, the monster tarantula opened its dripping jaws. </p><p>Its mandibles gaped wide. The poison fangs were </p><p>unsheathed. The creature was thirty paces away, </p><p>twenty paces—ten. It leaped into the air, eyes </p><p>glittering, all its eight legs extended to seize, fangs </p><p>bared— </p><p> Burl screamed again, and thrust out his arms to</p><p>ward off the impact of the leap. In his terror, his </p><p>grasp upon his spear had become agonized. The </p><p>spear-point shot out and the tarantula fell upon it. </p><p>Nearly a quarter of the spear entered the body of </p><p>the ferocious thing. </p><p> It stuck upon the spear, writhing horribly, still</p><p>struggling to reach Burl, who was transfixed with </p><p>horror. The mandibles clashed, strange sounds </p><p>came from the beast. Then one of the attenuated, </p><p>hairy legs rasped across Burl’s forearm. He gasped </p><p>in ultimate fear and stepped backward—and the </p><p>edge of the cliff gave way beneath him. </p><p> He hurtled downward, still clutching the spear</p><p>which held the writhing creature from him. Down </p><p>through space, his eyes glassy with panic, the two </p><p>creatures—the man and the giant tarantula—fell </p><p>together. There was a strangely elastic crash and </p><p>crackling. They had fallen into the web beneath </p><p>them. </p><p> Burl had reached the end of terror. He could be</p><p>no more fear-struck. Struggling madly in the </p><p>gummy coils of an immense web, which ever bound </p><p>him more tightly, with a wounded creature shud- </p><p>dering in agony not a yard from him—yet a </p><p>wounded creature that still strove to reach him with </p><p>THE MAD PLANET </p><p>745 </p><p> its poison fangs—{Burl had reached the limit of</p><p> panic.</p><p> He fought like a madman to break the coils about</p><p> him. His arms and breast were greasy from the</p><p> oily fish, and the-sticlcy web did not adhere to them,</p><p> but his legs and body were inextricably fastened by</p><p> the elastic threads spread for just such prey as he.</p><p> He paused a moment, in exhaustion. Then he</p><p> saw, five yards away, the silvery and black monster</p><p> waiting patiently for him to weary himself. It</p><p> judged the moment propitious. The tarantula and</p><p> the man were one in its eyes, one struggling thing</p><p> that had fallen opportunely into its snare. They</p><p> were moving but feebly now. The spider advanced</p><p> delicately, swinging its huge bulk nimbly along the</p><p> web, paying out a cable after it as it came.</p><p> Burl's arms were free, because of the greasy coat-</p><p> ing they had received. He waved them wildly,</p><p> shrieking at the pitiless monster that approached.</p><p> The spider paused. Those moving arms suggested</p><p> mandibles that might wound or slap.</p><p> Spiders take few hazards. This spider was no</p><p> exception to the rule. It drew cautiously near, then</p><p> stopped. It’s spinnerets became busy, and with one</p><p> of its eight legs, used like an arm, it flung a gummy</p><p> silk impartially over both the tarantula and the</p><p> man.</p><p> Burl fought against the descending shroud. He</p><p> strove to thrust it away, but in vain. In a matter</p><p> of minutes he was completely covered in a silken</p><p> cloth that hid even the light from his eyes. He</p><p> and his enemy, the giant tarantula, were beneath</p><p> the same covering, though the tarantula moved but</p><p> weakly.</p><p> The shower ceased. The wed-spider had decided</p><p> that they were helpless. Then Burl felt the cables</p><p> of the web give slightly, as the spider approached to</p><p> sting and suck the sweet juices from its prey.</p><p>CHAPTER III. </p><p>The Army Ants </p><p> THE web yielded gently as the added weight</p><p> of the black-bellied spider approached. Burl</p><p> froze into stillness under his enveloping cov-</p><p> ering. Beneath the same silken shroud the taran-</p><p> tula writhed in agony upon the point of Burl’s spear.</p><p> It clashed its jaws, shuddering upon the horny</p><p> barb.</p><p> Burl was quiet in an ecstasy of terror. He waited</p><p> for the poison-fangs to be thrust into him. He</p><p> knew the process. Pie had seen the leisurely fashion</p><p> in which the giant spiders delicately stung their</p><p> prey, then withdrew to wait without impatience for</p><p> the poison to do its work.</p><p> When their victim had ceased to struggle they</p><p> drew near again, and sucked the sweet juices from</p><p> the body, first from one point and then another,</p><p> until what had so recently been a creature vibrant</p><p> with life became a shrunken, withered husk—to be</p><p> flung from the web at nightfall. Most spiders are</p><p> tidy housekeepers, destroying their snares daily to</p><p> . spin anew.</p><p> i The bloated, evil creature moved meditatively</p><p> i about the shining sheet of silk it had cast over the</p><p> 1 man and the giant tarantula when they fell from</p><p> | the cliff above. Now only the tarantula moved</p><p> | feebly. Its body was outlined by a bulge in the</p><p>concealing shroud, throbbing faintly as it still strug- </p><p>gled with the spear in its vitals. The irregularly </p><p>rounded protuberance offered a point of attack for </p><p>the web-spider. It moved quickly forward, and </p><p>stung. </p><p> Galvanized into fresh torment by his new</p><p>agony, the tarantula writhed in a very hell of pain. </p><p>Its legs, clustered about the spear still fastened into </p><p>its body, struck out purposelessly, in horrible ges- </p><p>tures of delirious suffering. Burl screamed as one </p><p>of them touched him and struggled himself. </p><p> His arms and head were free beneath the silken</p><p>sheet because of the grease and oil that coated them. </p><p>He clutched at the threads about him and strove to </p><p>draw himself away from his deadly neighbor. The </p><p>threads did not break, but they parted one from </p><p>another, and a tiny opening appeared. One of the </p><p>tarantula’s attenuated limbs touched him again. </p><p>With the strength of utter panic he hauled himself </p><p>away, and the opening enlarged. Another struggle, </p><p>and Burl’s head emerged into the open air, and he </p><p>stared down for twenty feet upon an open space al- </p><p>most carpeted with the chitinous remains of his </p><p>present captor's former victims. </p><p> Burl’s head was free, and his breast and arms.</p><p>The fish slung over his shoulder had shed its oil </p><p>upon him impartially. But the lower part of his </p><p>body was held firm by the gummy snare of the web- </p><p>spider, a snare far more tenacious than any bird- </p><p>lime ever manufactured by man. </p><p> He hung in his tiny window for a moment, de-</p><p>spairing. Then he saw, at a little distance, the </p><p>bulk of the monster spider, waiting patiently for </p><p>its poison to take effect and the struggling of its </p><p>prey to be stilled. The tarantula was no more than </p><p>shuddering now. Soon it would be still, and the </p><p>black-bellied creature waiting on the web would </p><p>approach for its meal. </p><p> Burl withdrew his head and thrust desperately at</p><p>the sticky stuff about his loins and legs. The oil </p><p>upon his hands kept it from clinging to them, and </p><p>it gave a little. In a flash of inspiration, Burl </p><p>understood. He reached over his shoulder and </p><p>grasped the greasy fish; tore it in a dozen places </p><p>and smeared himself with the now rancid exuda- </p><p>tion, pushing the sticky threads from his limbs and </p><p>oiling the surface from which he had thrust it </p><p>away. </p><p> He felt the web tremble. To the spider, its poi-</p><p>son seemed to have failed of effect. Another sting </p><p>seemed to be necessary. This time it would not in- </p><p>sert its fangs into the quiescent tarantula, but </p><p>would sting where the disturbance was manifest— </p><p>would send its deadly venom into Bu,rl. </p><p> He gasped, and drew himself toward his window.</p><p>It was as if he would have pulled his legs from his </p><p>body. His head emerged, his shoulders, half his </p><p>body was out of the hole. </p><p> The colossal spider surveyed him, and made ready</p><p>to cast more of its silken sheet upon him. The </p><p>spinnerets became active and the sticky stuff about </p><p>Burl’s feet gave way! He shot out of the open- </p><p>ing and fell sprawling, awkwardly and heavily, upon </p><p>the earth below, crashing upon the shrunken shell </p><p>of a flying beetle which had fallen into the snare </p><p>and had not escaped as he had. </p><p> Burl rolled over and over, and then sat up. An</p><p>angry foot-long ant stood before him, its mandi- </p><p>746 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>bles extended threateningly, while its antennas </p><p>waved wildly in the air. A shrill stridulation filled </p><p>the air. </p><p> In ages past, when ants were tiny creatures of</p><p>lengths to be measured in fractions of an inch, </p><p>learned scientists debated gravely if their tribe </p><p>possessed a cry. They believed that certain grooves </p><p>upon the body of the insects, after the fashion of </p><p>those upon the great legs of the cricket, might </p><p>offer the means of uttering an infinitely high- </p><p>pitched sound too shrill for man's ears to catch. </p><p> Burl knew that the stridulation was caused by</p><p>the doubtful insect before him, though he had never </p><p>wondered how it was produced. The cry was used </p><p>to summon others of its city, to help it in its diffi- </p><p>culty or good fortune. </p><p> ■Clickings sounded fifty or sixty feet away. Com-</p><p>rades were coming to aid the pioneer. Harmless </p><p>save when interfered with—all save the army ant, </p><p>that is—the whole ant tribe was formidable when </p><p>aroused. Utterly fearless, they could pull down a </p><p>man and slay him as so many infuriated fox terriers </p><p>might have done thirty thousand years before. </p><p> Burl fled, without debate, and nearly collided</p><p>with one of the anchoring cables of the web from </p><p>which he had barely escaped a moment before. He </p><p>heard the shrill sound behind him suddenly sub- </p><p>side. The ant, short-sighted as all ants were, no </p><p>longer felt itself threatened and went peacefully </p><p>about the business Burl had interrupted, that of </p><p>finding among the grewsome relics beneath the </p><p>spider’s web some edible carrion which might feed </p><p>the inhabitants of its city. </p><p> Burl sped on for a few hundred yards, and</p><p>stopped. It behooved him to move carefully. He </p><p>was in strange territory, and as even the most </p><p>familiar territory was full of sudden and implacable </p><p>dangers, unknown lands were doubly or trebly </p><p>perilous. </p><p> Burl, too, found difficulty in moving. The glut-</p><p>inous stuff from the spider’s shroud of silk still </p><p>stuck to his feet and picked up small objects as he </p><p>went along. Old ant-gnawed fragments of insect </p><p>armour pricked him even through his toughened </p><p>soles. </p><p> He looked about cautiously and removed them,</p><p>took a dozen steps and had to stop again. Burl’s </p><p>brain had been uncommonly stimulated of late. It</p><p>had gotten him into at least one predicament—due </p><p>to his invention of a spear—but had no less readily </p><p>led to his escape from another. But for the reason- </p><p>ing that had led him to use the grease from the </p><p>fish upon his shoulder in oiling his body when he </p><p>struggled out of the spider’s snare, he would now </p><p>be furnishing a meal for that monster. </p><p> Cautiously, Burl looked all about him. He seemed</p><p>to be safe. Then, quite deliberately, he sat down </p><p>to think. It was the first time in his life that he </p><p>had done such a thing. The people of his tribe </p><p>were not given to meditation. But an idea had </p><p>struck Burl with all the force of inspiration—an </p><p>abstract idea. </p><p> When he was in difficulties, something within him</p><p>seemed to suggest a way out. Would it suggest an </p><p>inspiration now? He puzzled over the problem. </p><p>Childlike—and savage-like—the instant the thought </p><p>came to him he proceeded to test it out. He fixed </p><p>his gaze upon his foot, The sharp edges of pebbles. </p><p>of the remains of insect-armour, of a dozen things, </p><p>hurt his feet when he walked. They had done so </p><p>even since he had been born, but never before had </p><p>his feet been sticky so that the irritation continued </p><p>for more than a single step. </p><p> Now he gazed upon his foot, and waited for the</p><p>thought within him to develop. Meanwhile he </p><p>slowly removed the sharp-pointed fragments, one by </p><p>one. Partly coated as they were with the half- </p><p>liquid gum from his feet, they clung to his fingers </p><p>as they had to his feet, except upon those portions </p><p>where the oil was thick as before. </p><p> Burl’s reasoning, before, was simple and of the</p><p>primary order. Where oil covered him, the web </p><p>did not. Therefore he would coat the rest of him- </p><p>self with oil. Had he been placed in the same pre- </p><p>dicament again, he would have used the same means </p><p>of escape. But to apply a bit of knowldge gained </p><p>in one predicament to another difficulty was some- </p><p>thing he had not yet done. </p><p> A dog may be taught that by pulling on the</p><p>latch-string of a door he may open it, but the same </p><p>dog coming to a high and close-barred gate with a </p><p>latch-string attached will never think of pulling </p><p>on this second latch-string. He associates a latch- </p><p>string with the opening of the door. The opening </p><p>of a gate is another matter entirely. </p><p> Burl had been stirred to one invention by immi-</p><p>nent peril. That is not extraordinary. But to </p><p>reason in cold blood, as he presently did, that oil </p><p>on his feet would nullify the glue upon his feet and</p><p>enable him again to walk in comfort—that was a </p><p>triumph. The inventions of savages are essentially </p><p>matters of life and death, of food and safety. Com- </p><p>fort and luxury are only produced by intelligence </p><p>of a high order. </p><p> Burl, in safety, had added to his comfort. That</p><p>was truly a more important thing in his develop- </p><p>ment than almost any other thing he could have </p><p>done. He oiled his feet. </p><p> It was an almost infinitesimal problem, but Burl’s</p><p>struggles with the mental process of reasoning were </p><p>actual. Thirty thousand years before him, a wise </p><p>man had pointed out that education is simply train- </p><p>ing in thought, in efficient and effective thinking. </p><p>Burl’s tribe had been too much preoccupied with </p><p>food and mere existence to think, and now Burl, </p><p>sitting at the base of a squat toadstool that all but </p><p>concealed him, reexemplified Rodin’s “Thinker” for </p><p>the first time in many generations. </p><p> For Burl to reason, that oil upon the soles of</p><p>his feet would guard him against sharp stones wa3 </p><p>as much a triumph of intellect as any masterpiece </p><p>of art in the ages before him. Burl was learning </p><p>how to think.	j</p><p> He stood up, walked, and crowed in sheer delight,</p><p>then paused a moment in awe of his own intelli- </p><p>gence. Thirty-five miles from his tribe, naked, </p><p>unarmed, utterly ignorant of fire, of wood, of any </p><p>weapons save a spear he had experimented with the </p><p>day before, abysmally uninformed concerning the </p><p>very existence of any art or science, Burl stopped to </p><p>assure himself that he was very wonderful. </p><p> Pride came to him. He wished to display himself</p><p>to Saya, these things upon his feet, and his spear. </p><p>But his spear was gone. </p><p> With touching faith in the efficacy of this new</p><p>pastime, Burl sat promptly down again and knitted </p><p>THE MAD PLANET </p><p>747 </p><p>his brows. Just as a superstitious person, once con- </p><p>vinced that by appeal to a favorite talisman he will </p><p>be guided aright, will inevitably apply to that talis- </p><p>man on all occasions, so Burl plumped himself down </p><p>to think. </p><p> These questions were easily answered. Burl</p><p>was naked. He would search out garments for him- </p><p>self. He was weaponless. He would find himself </p><p>a spear. He was hungry—and would seek food, and </p><p>he was far from his tribe, so he would go to them. </p><p>Puerile reasoning, of course, but valuable because </p><p>it was consciously reasoning, consciously appealing </p><p>to his mind for guidance in difficulty, deliberate </p><p>progress from a mental desire to a mental resolution. </p><p> Even in the high civilization of ages before, few</p><p>men had really used their brains. The great ma- </p><p>jority of people had depended upon machines and </p><p>their leaders to think for them. Burl’s tribe-folk </p><p>depended on their stomachs. Burl, however, was </p><p>gradually developing the habit of.thinking which </p><p>makes for leadership and which would be invalu- </p><p>able to his little tribe. </p><p> He stood up again and faced up-stream, moving</p><p>slowly and cautiously, his eyes searching the ground </p><p>before him keenly and his ears alert for the slightest </p><p>sound of danger. Gigantic butterflies, riotous in </p><p>coloring, fluttered overhead through the misty </p><p>haze. Sometimes a grasshopper hurtled through </p><p>the air like a projectile, its transparent wings beat- </p><p>ing the air frantically. Now and then a wasp sped </p><p>by, intent upon its hunting, or a bee droned heavily </p><p>along, anxious and worried, striving in a nearly </p><p>flowerless world to gather the pollen that would </p><p>feed the hive. </p><p> Here and there Burl saw flies of various sorts,</p><p>somo no larger than his thumb, but others the size </p><p>of his whole hand. They fed upon the juices that </p><p>dripped from the maggot-infested mushrooms, when </p><p>filth more to their liking was not at hand. </p><p> Very far away a shrill roaring sounded faintly.</p><p>It was like a multitude of clickings blended into </p><p>a single sound, but was so. far away that it did not </p><p>impress itself upon Burl’s attention. He had all </p><p>the strictly localized vision of a child. What was* </p><p>near was important, and what was distant could be </p><p>ignored. Only the imminent required attention, </p><p>and Burl was preoccupied. </p><p> Had he listened, he would have realized that army</p><p>ants were abroad in countless millions, spreading</p><p>themselves out in a broad array and eating all they </p><p>came upon far more destructively than so many </p><p>locusts. </p><p> Locusts in past ages had eaten all green things.</p><p>There were only giant cabbages and a few such </p><p>tenacious rank growths in the world that Burl </p><p>knew. The locusts had vanished with civilization </p><p>and knowledge and the greater part of mankind, but </p><p>the army ants remained as an invincible enemy to </p><p>men and insects, and the most of the fungus growths </p><p>that covered the earth. </p><p> Burl did not notice the sound, however. He moved</p><p>forward, briskly though cautiously, searching with </p><p>his eyes for garments, food, and weapons. He con- </p><p>fidently expected to find all of them within a short </p><p>distance. </p><p> Surely enough, he found a thicket—if one might</p><p>call it so—of edible fungi no more than half a mile </p><p>beyond the spot where he had improvised his Ban-* </p><p>dais to protect the soles of his feet. </p><p> Without especial elation, Burl tugged at the</p><p>largest until he had broken off a food supply for </p><p>several days. He went on, eating as he did so, </p><p>past a broad plain a mile and more across, being </p><p>broken into odd little hillocks by gradually ripen- </p><p>ing and suddenly developing mushrooms with which </p><p>he was unfamiliar. </p><p> The earth seemed to be in process of being pushed</p><p>aside by rounded protuberances of which only the </p><p>tips showed. Blood-red hemispheres seemed to be </p><p>forcing aside the earth so they might reach the </p><p>outer air. </p><p> Burl looked at them curiously, and passed among</p><p>them without touching them. They were strange, </p><p>and to Burl most strange things meant danger. In </p><p>any event, Burl was full of a new purpose now. He </p><p>wished garments and weapons. </p><p> Above the plain a wasp hovered, a heavy object</p><p>dangling beneath its black belly, ornamented by a </p><p>single red band. It was a wasp—the hairy sand- </p><p>wasp—and it was bringing a paralyzed gray cater- </p><p>pillar to its burrow. </p><p> Burl watched it drop down with the speed and</p><p>sureness of an arrow, pull aside a heavy, flat stone, </p><p>and descend into the ground. It had a vertical </p><p>shaft dug down for forty feet or more. </p><p> It descended, evidently inspected the interior, re-</p><p>appeared, and vanished into the hole again, drag-</p><p>ging the gray worm after it. Burl, marching on </p><p>over the broad plain that seemed stricken with some </p><p>erupting disease from the number of red pimples </p><p>making their appearance, did not know what passed </p><p>below, but observed the wasp emerge again and </p><p>busily scratch dirt and stones into the shaft until </p><p>it was full. </p><p> The wasp had paralyzed a caterpillar, taken it to</p><p>the already prepared burrow, laid an egg upon it, </p><p>and filled up the entrance. In course of time the egg </p><p>would hatch into a grub barely as long as Burl’s </p><p>forefinger, which would then feed upon the torpid </p><p>caterpillar until it had waxed large and fat. Then </p><p>it would weave itself a chrysalis and sleep a long </p><p>sleep, only to wake as a wasp and dig its way to the </p><p>open air. </p><p> Burl reached the farther side of the plain and</p><p>found himself threading the aisles of one of the </p><p>fungus forests in which the growths were hideous, </p><p>misshapen travesties upon the trees they had sup- </p><p>planted. Bloated, yellow limbs branched off from </p><p>rounded, swollen trunks. Here and there a pear- </p><p>shaped puff-ball, Burl’s height and half as much </p><p>again, waited craftily until a chance touch should </p><p>cause it to shoot upward a curling puff of infinitely </p><p>fine dust. </p><p> Burl went cautiously. There were dangers here,</p><p>but he moved forward steadily, none the less. A </p><p>great mass of edible mushroom was slung under </p><p>one of his arms, and from time to time he broke </p><p>off a fragment and ate of it, while his large eyes </p><p>searched this way and that for threats of harm. </p><p> Behind him, a high, shrill roaring had grown</p><p>slightly in volume and nearness, but was still too </p><p>far away to impress Burl. The army ants were </p><p>working havoc in the distance. By thousands and </p><p>millions, myriads upon myriads, they were foraging </p><p>the country, clambering upon every eminence, des- </p><p>cending into every depression, their antenna wav- </p><p>743 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>ing restlessly and their mandibles forever threaten- </p><p>ingly extended. The ground was black with them, </p><p>and each was ten inches and more in length. </p><p> A single such creature would be formidable to an</p><p>unarmed and naked man like Burl, whose wisest </p><p>move would be flight, but in their thousands and </p><p>millions they presented a menace from which no </p><p>escape seemed possible. They were advancing </p><p>steadily and rapidly, shrill stridulations and a mul- </p><p>titude of clickings marking their movements. </p><p> The great, helpless caterpillars upon the giant</p><p>cabbages heard the sound of their coming, but were </p><p>too stupid to flee. The black multitudes covered the </p><p>rank vegetables, and tiny but voracious jaws began </p><p>to tear at the flaccid masses of flesh. </p><p> Each creature had some futile means of strug-</p><p>gling. The caterpillars strove to throw off their </p><p>innumerable assailants by writhings and contor- </p><p>tions, wholly ineffective. The bees fought their en- </p><p>trance to the gigantic hives with stings and wing- </p><p>beats. The moths took to the air in helpless blind- </p><p>ness when discovered by the relentless throngs of </p><p>small black insects which reeked of formic acid and </p><p>left the ground behind them denuded of every liv- </p><p>ing thing. </p><p> Before the oncoming horde was a world of teem-</p><p>ing life, where mushrooms and fungi fought with </p><p>thinning numbers of giant cabbages for foothold. </p><p>Behind the black multitude was—nothing. Mush- </p><p>rooms, cabbages, bees, wasps, cricket, every creep- </p><p>ing and crawling thing that did not get aloft be- </p><p>fore the black tide reached it was lost, tom to bits </p><p>by tiny mandibles. Even the hunting spiders and </p><p>tarantulas fell before the hosts of insects, having </p><p>killed many in their final struggles, but over- </p><p>whelmed by sheer numbers. And the wounded and </p><p>dying army ants made food for their sound com- </p><p>rades. </p><p> There is no mercy among insects. Only the web-</p><p>spiders sat unmoved and immovable in their colos- </p><p>sal snares, secure in the knowledge that their </p><p>gummy webs would discourage attempts at invasion </p><p>along the slender supporting cables. </p><p> Surging onward, flowing like a monstrous,</p><p>murky tide over the yellow, steaming earth, the </p><p>army ants advanced. Their vanguard reached the </p><p>river, and recoiled. Burl was perhaps five miles </p><p>distant when they changed their course, communi- </p><p>cating the altered line of march to those behind</p><p>them in some mysterious fashion of transmitting </p><p>intelligence. </p><p> Thirty thousand years before, scientists had de-</p><p>bated gravely over the means of communication </p><p>among ants. They had observed that a single ant </p><p>finding a bit of booty too large for him to handle </p><p>alone would return to the ant-city and return with </p><p>others. From that one instance they deduced a </p><p>language of gesture made with the antennas. </p><p> Burl had no wise theories. He merely knew facts,</p><p>but he knew that the ants had some form of speech </p><p>or transmission of ideas. Now, however, he was </p><p>moving cautiously along toward the stamping- </p><p>grounds of his tribe, in complete ignorance of the </p><p>black blanket of living creatures creeping over the </p><p>ground toward him. </p><p> A million tragedies marked the progress of the</p><p>insect army. There was a tiny colony of mining </p><p>bees—Zebra bees—a single mother, some four feet </p><p>long, had dug a huge gallery with some ten cells, </p><p>in which she laid her eggs and fed her grubs with </p><p>hard-gathered pollen. The grubs had waxed fat </p><p>and large, became bees, and laid eggs in their </p><p>turn, within the gallery their mother had dug out </p><p>for them./ </p><p> Ten such bulky insects now foraged busily for</p><p>grubs within the ancestral home, while the founder </p><p>of the colony had grown draggled and wingless with </p><p>the passing of time. Unable to forage, herself, </p><p>the old bee became the guardian of the nest or hive, </p><p>as is the custom among the mining bees. She </p><p>closed the opening of the hive with her head, mak- </p><p>ing a living barrier within the entrance, and with- </p><p>drawing to give entrance and exit only to duly </p><p>authenticated members of the colony. </p><p> The ancient and draggled concierge of the under-</p><p>ground dwelling was at her post when the wave of </p><p>army ants swept over her. Tiny, evil-smelling feet </p><p>trampled upon her. She emerged to fight with </p><p>mandible and sting for the sanctity of the hive. </p><p>In a moment she was a shaggy mass of biting ants, </p><p>rending and tearing at her chitinous armour. The </p><p>old bee fought madly, viciously, sounding a buzzing </p><p>alarm to the colonists yet within the hive. They </p><p>emerged, fighting as they came, for the gallery lead- </p><p>ing down was a dark flood of small insects. </p><p> For a few moments a battle such as would make</p><p>an epic was in progress. Ten huge bees, each four </p><p>to five feet long, fighting with legs and jaw, wing </p><p>and mandible, with all the ferocity of as many </p><p>tigers. The tiny, vicious ants covered them, snap-</p><p>ping at their multiple eyes, biting at the tender </p><p>joints in their armour—sometimes releasing the </p><p>larger prey to leap upon an injured comrade wound- </p><p>ed by the huge creature they battled in common. </p><p> The fight, however, could have but one ending.</p><p>Struggle as the bees might, herculean as their ef- </p><p>forts might be, they were powerless against the </p><p>incredible numbers of their assailants, who tore them </p><p>into tiny fragments and devoured them. Before the </p><p>last shred of the hive’s defenders had vanished, </p><p>the hive itself was gutted alike of the grubs it had </p><p>contained and the food brought to the grubs by </p><p>such weary effort of the mature bees. </p><p> The army ants went on. Only an empty gallery</p><p>remained, that and a few fragments of tough </p><p>armour, unappetising even to the omnivorous ants. </p><p> Burl was meditatively inspecting the scene of a</p><p>recent tragedy, where rent and scraped fragments </p><p>of a great beetle’s shiny casing lay upon the ground. </p><p>A greater beetle had come upon the first and slain </p><p>him. Burl was looking upon the remains of the </p><p>meal. </p><p> Three or four minims, little ants barely six</p><p>inches long, foraged industriously among the bits. </p><p>A new ant-city was to be formed, and the queen- </p><p>ant lay hidden a half-mile away. These were the </p><p>first hatchlings, who would feed the larger ants on </p><p>whom would fall the great work of the ant-city. </p><p>Burl ignored them, searching with his eyes for a </p><p>spear or weapon of some sort. </p><p> Behind him the clicking roar, the high-pitched</p><p>stridulations of the horde of army ants, rose in </p><p>volume. Burl turned disgustedly away. The best </p><p>he could find in the way of a weapon was a fiercely </p><p>toothed hind-leg. He picked it up, and an angry </p><p>whine rose from the ground. </p><p>THE MAD PLANET </p><p>749 </p><p> One of the black minims was working busily to</p><p>detach a fragment of flesh from the joint of the </p><p>leg, and Burl had snatched the morsel from him. </p><p>The little creature was hardly half a foot in length, </p><p>but it advanced upon Burl, shrilling angrily. He </p><p>struck it with the leg and crushed it. Two of the </p><p>other minims appeared, attracted by the noise the </p><p>first had made. Discovering the crushed body of </p><p>their fellow, they unceremoniously dismembered it </p><p>and bore it away in triumph. </p><p> Burl went on, swinging the toothed limb in his</p><p>hand. It made a fair club, and Burl was accustomed </p><p>to use stones to crush the juicy legs of such giant </p><p>crickets as his tribe sometimes came upon. He </p><p>formed a half-defined idea of a club. The sharp </p><p>teeth of the thing in his hand made him realize </p><p>that a sidewise blow was better than a spear-like </p><p>thrust. </p><p> The sound behind him had become a distant</p><p>whispering, high-pitched, and growing nearer. </p><p>The army ants swept over a mushroom forest, and </p><p>the yellow, umbrella-like growths swarmed with </p><p>black creatures devouring the substance on which </p><p>they found a foot-hold. </p><p> A great blue-bottle fly, shining with a metallic</p><p>luster, reposed in an ecstacy of feasting, sipping </p><p>through its long proboscis the dark-colored liquid </p><p>that dripped slowly from a mushroom. Maggots </p><p>filled the mushroom, and exuded a solvent pepsin that </p><p>liquified the white firm “meat.” </p><p> They fed upon this soup, this gruel, and a surplus</p><p>dripped to the ground below, where the blue-bottle </p><p>drank eagerly. Burl drew near, and struck. The </p><p>fly collapsed into a writhing heap. Burl stood over </p><p>it for an instant, pondering. </p><p> The army ants came nearer, down into a tiny</p><p>valley, swarming into and through a little brook </p><p>over which Burl had leaped. Ants can remain </p><p>under water for a long time without drowning, so </p><p>the small stream was but a minor obstacle, though </p><p>the current of water swept many of them off their </p><p>feet until they choked the brook-bed and their com- </p><p>rades passed over their struggling bodies dry-shod. </p><p>They were no more than temporarily annoyed how- </p><p>ever, and crawled out to resume their march. </p><p> About a quarter of a mile to the left of Burl's</p><p>line of march, and perhaps a mile behind the spot </p><p>where he stood over the dead blue-bottle fly, there </p><p>was a stretch of an acre or more where the giant,</p><p>rank cabbages had so far resisted the encroach- </p><p>ments of the ever-present mushrooms. The pale, </p><p>cross-shaped flowers of the cabbages formed food </p><p>for many bees, and the leaves fed numberless grubs </p><p>and worms, and loud-voiced crickets which crouched </p><p>about on the ground, munching busily at the succu- </p><p>lent green stuff. The army ants swept into the </p><p>green area, ceaselessly devouring all they came up- </p><p>on. </p><p> A terrific din arose. The crickets hurtled away</p><p>in rocket-like flight, in a dark cloud of wildly-beat- </p><p>ing wings. They shot aimlessly in any direction, </p><p>with the result that half, or more that half, fell </p><p>in the midst of the black tide of devouring insects </p><p>and were seized as they fell. They uttered terrible </p><p>cries as they were being torn to bits. Horrible in- </p><p>human screams reached Burl’s ears. </p><p> A single such cry of agony would not have at-</p><p>tracted Burl’s attention—he lived in the very </p><p>atmosphere of tragedy—but the chorus of crea- </p><p>tures in torment made him look up. This was no </p><p>minor horror. Wholesale slaughter was going on. </p><p>He peered anxiously in the direction of the sound. </p><p> A stretch of sickly yellow fungus was here and</p><p>there interspersed with a squat toadstool or a splash </p><p>of vivid color where one of the many “rusts” had </p><p>found a foothold. To the left a group of awkward, </p><p>misshapen fungoids clustered in silent mockery of </p><p>a forest of trees. There was a mass of faded green, </p><p>where the giant cabbages stood. </p><p> With the true sun never shining upon them save</p><p>through a blanket of thick haze or heavy clouds, </p><p>they were pallid things, hut they were the only </p><p>green things Burl had seen. Their nodding white </p><p>flowers with four petals in the form of a cross </p><p>glowed against the yellowish-green leaves. But </p><p>as Burl gazed toward them, the green became slowly </p><p>black. </p><p> From where he stood, Burl could see two or three</p><p>great grubs in lazy contentment, eating ceaselessly </p><p>of the cabbages on which they rested. Suddenly </p><p>first one and then the other began to jerk spasmo- </p><p>dically. Burl saw that about each of them a tiny </p><p>rim of black had clustered. Tiny black motes milled </p><p>over the green surfaces of the cabbages. The grubs </p><p>became black, the cabbages became black. Horrible </p><p>contortions of the writhing grubs told of the </p><p>agonies they were enduring. Then a black wave </p><p>appeared at the further edge of the stretch of </p><p>sickly yellow fungus, a glistening, living wave, that </p><p>moved forward rapidly with the the roar of click- </p><p>ings and a persistent overtone of shrill stridula-</p><p>tions. </p><p> The hair rose upon Burl’s head. He knew what</p><p>this was! He knew all too well the meaning of </p><p>that tide of shining bodies. With a gasp of terror, </p><p>all his intellectual preoccupations forgotten, he </p><p>turned and fled in ultimate panic. And the tide </p><p>came slowly on after him. </p><p>CHAPTER IV. </p><p>The Red Death </p><p>HE flung away the great mass of edible mush- </p><p>room, but clung to his sharp-toothed club </p><p>desperately, and darted through the tangled </p><p>aisles of the little mushroom forest with a heedless </p><p>disregard of the dangers that might await him </p><p>there. Flies buzzed about him loudly, huge crea- </p><p>tures, glittering with a metallic luster. 'Once he </p><p>was struck upon the shoulder by the body of one </p><p>of them, and his skin was torn by the swiftly </p><p>vibrating wings of the insect, as long as Burl’s </p><p>hand. </p><p> Burl thrust it away and sped on. The oil with</p><p>which he was partly covered had turned rancid, </p><p>now, and the odor attracted them, connoisseurs of </p><p>the fetid. They buzzed over his head, keeping pace </p><p>even with his head-long flight. </p><p> A heavy weight settled upon his head, and in a</p><p>moment was doubled. Two of the creatures had </p><p>dropped upon his oily hair, to sip the rancid oil </p><p>through their disgusting proboscides. Burl shook </p><p>them off with his hand and ran madly on. His </p><p>ears were keenly attuned to the sound of the army </p><p>ants behind him, and it grew but little farther </p><p>away. </p><p>•750 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> The clicking roar continued, but began to be</p><p>overshadowed by the buzzing of the flies. In Burl’s </p><p>time the flies had not great heaps of putrid matter </p><p>in which to lay their eggs. The ants—busy </p><p>scavengers—carted away the debris of the mul- </p><p>titudinous tragedies of the insect world long before </p><p>it could acquire the gamey flavor beloved by the fly </p><p>maggots. Only in isolated spots were the flies </p><p>really numerous, but there they clustered in clouds </p><p>that darkened the sky. </p><p> Such a buzzing, whirling cloud surrounded the</p><p>madly-running figure of Burl. It seemed as though </p><p>a miniature whirlwind kept pace with the little pink- </p><p>skinned man, a whirlwind composed of winged </p><p>bodies and multi-faceted eyes. He twirled his club </p><p>before him, and almost every stroke was interrupted </p><p>by an -.mpact against a thinly-armoured body which </p><p>collapsed with a spurting of reddish liquid. </p><p> An agonizing pain as of a red-hot iron struck</p><p>upon Burl’s back. One of the stinging flies had </p><p>thrust its sharp-tipped proboscis into Burl’s flesh </p><p>to suck the blood. </p><p> Burl uttered a cry and—ran full tilt into the</p><p>thick stalk of a blackened and draggled toadstool. </p><p>There was a curious crackling as of wet punk or </p><p>brittle, rotten wood. The toadstool collapsed upon </p><p>itself with a strange splashing sound. Many flies </p><p>had laid their eggs in the fungoid, and it was a </p><p>teeming mass of corruption and ill-smelling liquid. </p><p> With the crash of the toadstool’s “head” upon the</p><p>ground, it fell into a dozen pieces, and the earth for </p><p>yards around was spattered with a stinking liquid </p><p>in which tiny, headless maggots twitched convul- </p><p>sively. </p><p> The buzzing of the flies took on a note of satis-</p><p>faction, and they settled by hundreds about the edges </p><p>of the ill-smelling pools, becoming lost in the </p><p>ecstacy of feasting while Burl staggered to his feet </p><p>and darted off again. This time he was but a minor </p><p>attraction to the flies, and but one or two came near </p><p>him. From every direction they were hurrying to </p><p>the toadstool feast, to the banquet of horrible lique- </p><p>fied fungus that lay spread upon the ground. </p><p> Burl ran on. He passed beneath the wide-spread-</p><p>ing leaves of a giant cabbage. A great grass-hop- </p><p>per crouched upon the ground, its tremendous jaws </p><p>crunching the rank vegetation voraciously. Half a </p><p>dozen great worms ate steadily from their resting- </p><p>places among the leaves. One of them slung itself</p><p>beneath an over-hanging leaf—which would have </p><p>thatched a dozen homes for as many men—and was </p><p>placidly anchoring itself in preparation for the </p><p>spinning of a cocoon in which to sleep the sleep of </p><p>metamorphosis. </p><p> A mile away, the great black tide of army ants</p><p>was advancing relentlessly. The great cabbage, the </p><p>huge grasshopper, and all the stupid caterpillars up- </p><p>on the wide leaves would soon be covered with the </p><p>tiny, biting insects. The cabbage would be reduced </p><p>to a chewed and destroyed stump, the colossal, furry </p><p>grubs would be torn into a myriad mouthfuls and </p><p>devoured by the black army ants, and the grass- </p><p>hopper would strike out with terrific, unguided </p><p>strength, crushing its assailants by blows of its </p><p>powerful hind-legs and bites of its great jaws. But </p><p>it would die, making terrible sounds of torment as </p><p>the vicious mandibles of the army ants found </p><p>crevices in its armour. </p><p> The clicking roar of the ants’ advance oversha-</p><p>dowed all other sound now. Burl was running </p><p>madly, his breath coming in great gasps, his eyes </p><p>wide with panic. Alone of all the world about him, </p><p>he knew the danger behind. The insects he passed </p><p>were going about their business with that terrify- </p><p>ing efficiency found only in the insect world. </p><p> There is something strangely daunting in the ac-</p><p>tions of an insect. It moves so directly, with such </p><p>uncanny precision, with such utter indifference to </p><p>anything but the end in view. Cannibalism is a </p><p>rule, almost without exception. The paralysis of </p><p>prey, so it may remain alive and fresh—though in </p><p>agony—for weeks on end, is a common practice. </p><p>The eating piecemeal of still-living victims is a </p><p>matter of course. </p><p> Absolute mercilessness, utter callousness, in-</p><p>credible inhumanity beyond anything known in the </p><p>animal world is the natural and commonplace </p><p>practice of the insects. And these vast cruelties </p><p>are performed by armoured, machine-like creatures </p><p>with an abstraction and a routine air that suggests </p><p>a horrible Nature behind them all. </p><p> Burl nearly stumbled upon a tragedy. He passed</p><p>within a dozen yards of a space where a female </p><p>dung-beetle was devouring the mate whose honey- </p><p>moon had begun that same day and ended in that </p><p>gruesome fashion. Hidden behind a clump of mush- </p><p>rooms, a great yellow-banded spider was coyly </p><p>threatening a smaller male of her own species. He </p><p>was discreetly ardent, but if he won the favor of the </p><p>gruesome creature he was wooing, he would fur- </p><p>nish an appetizing meal for her some time within </p><p>twenty-four hours.</p><p> Burl’s heart was pounding madly. The breath</p><p>whistled in his nostrils—and behind him, the wave </p><p>of army ants was drawing nearer. They came upon </p><p>the feasting flies. Some took to the air and escaped </p><p>but others were too engrossed in their delicious </p><p>meal. The twitching little maggots, stranded upon </p><p>the earth by the scattering of their soupy broth, </p><p>were torn in pieces. The flies who were seized </p><p>vanished into little maws. The serried ranks of </p><p>black insects went on. </p><p> The tiny clickings of their limbs, the perpetual</p><p>challenges and cross-challenges of crossed antenna;, </p><p>the stridulations of the creatures, all combined to </p><p>make a high-pitched but deafening din. Now and </p><p>then another sound pierced the noises made by the </p><p>ants themselves. A cricket, seized by a thousand </p><p>tiny jaws, uttered cries of agony. The shrill note </p><p>of the crickets had grown deeply bass with the in- </p><p>crease in size of the organs that uttered it. </p><p> There was a strange contrast between the ground</p><p>before the advancing horde and that immediately </p><p>behind it. Before, a busy world, teeming with life. </p><p>Butterflies floating overhead on lazy wings, grubs </p><p>waxing fat and huge upon the giant cabbages, </p><p>crickets eating, great spiders sitting quietly in their </p><p>lairs waiting with invincible patience for prey to </p><p>draw near their trap-doors or fall into their webs, </p><p>colossal beetles lumbering heavily through the </p><p>mushroom forests, seeking food, making love in </p><p>the monstrous, tragic fashion. </p><p> And behind the wide belt of army ants—chaos.</p><p>The edible mushrooms gone. The giant cabbages </p><p>left as mere stumps of unappetizing pulp, the busy </p><p>life of the insect world completely wiped out save </p><p>THE MAD PLANET </p><p>751 </p><p>for the flying creatures that fluttered helplessly </p><p>over an utterly changed landscape. Here and there </p><p>little bands of stragglers moved busily over the </p><p>denuded earth, searching for some fragment of </p><p>food that might conceivably have been overlooked </p><p>by the main body. </p><p> Burl was putting forth his last ounce of strength.</p><p>His limbs trembled, his breathing was agony, sweat </p><p>stood out upon his forehead. He ran, a little, naked </p><p>man with the disjointed fragment of a huge in- </p><p>sect’s limb in his hand, running for his insignifi- </p><p>cant life, running as if his continued existence </p><p>among the million tragedies of that single day were </p><p>the purpose for which the universe had been created. </p><p> He sped across an open space a hundred yards</p><p>across. A thicket of beautifully golden mushrooms </p><p>(Agaricus coelareus) barred his way. Beyond the </p><p>mushrooms a range of strangely colored hills began, </p><p>purple and green and black and gold, melting into </p><p>each other, branching off from each other, inex- </p><p>tricably tangled. </p><p> They rose to a height of perhaps sixty or seventy</p><p>feet, and above them a little grayish haze had gath- </p><p>ered. There seemed to be a layer of tenuous vapor </p><p>upon their surfaces, which slowly rose and coiled, </p><p>and gathered into a tiny cloudlet above their tips. </p><p> The hills, themselves, were but masses of fungus,</p><p>mushrooms and rusts, fungoids of every descrip- </p><p>tion, yeasts, “musts,” and every form of fungus </p><p>growth which had grown within itself and about </p><p>itself until this great mass of strangely colored, </p><p>spongy stuff had gathered in a mass that undulated </p><p>unevenly across the level earth for miles. </p><p> Burl burst through the golden thicket and attacked</p><p>the ascent. His feet sank into the spongy sides of </p><p>the hillock. Panting, gasping, staggering from ex- </p><p>haustion, he made his way up the top. He plunged </p><p>into a little valley on the farther side, up another </p><p>slope. For perhaps ten minutes he forced himself </p><p>on, then collapsed. He lay, unable to move further, </p><p>in a little hollow, his sharp-toothed club still clasped </p><p>in his hands. Above him, a bright yellow butterfly </p><p>with a thirty-foot spread of wings fluttered lightly. </p><p> He lay motionless, breathing in great gasps, his</p><p>limbs refusing to lift him. </p><p> The sound of the army ants continued to grow</p><p>near. At last, above the crest of the last hillock </p><p>he had surmounted, two tiny antenna* appeared,</p><p>then the black, glistening head of an army ant, the </p><p>forerunner of its horde. It moved deliberately for- </p><p>ward, waving it antennee ceaselessly. It made its </p><p>way toward Burl, tiny clickings coming from the </p><p>movements of its limbs. </p><p> A little wisp of tenuous vapor swirled toward the</p><p>ant, a wisp of the same vapor that had gathered </p><p>above the whole range of hills as a thin, low cloud. It </p><p>enveloped the insect—and the ant seemed to be </p><p>attacked by a strange convulsion. Its legs moved </p><p>aimlessly. It threw itself desperately about. If </p><p>it had been a animal, Burl would have watched with </p><p>wondering eyes while it coughed and gasped, but it </p><p>was an insect breathing through air-holes in its </p><p>abdomen. It writhed upon the spongy fungus </p><p>growth across which it had been moving. </p><p> Burl, lying in an exhausted, panting heap upori</p><p>the purple mass of fungus, was conscious of a </p><p>strange sensation. His body felt strangely warm. </p><p>He knew nothing of fire or the heat of the sun, and </p><p>the only sensation of warmth he had ever known </p><p>was that caused when the members of his tribe </p><p>had huddled together in their hiding place when the </p><p>damp chill of the night had touched their soft- </p><p>slcinned bodies. Then the heat of their breath and </p><p>their bodies had kept out the chill. </p><p> This heat that Burl now felt was a hotter, fiercer</p><p>heat. He moved his body with a tremendous effort, </p><p>and for a moment the fungus was cool and soft </p><p>beneath him. Then, slowly the sensation of heat be- </p><p>gan again, increased until Burl’s skin was red </p><p>and inflamed from the irritation. </p><p> The . thin and tenuous vapor, too, made Burl’s</p><p>lungs smart and his eyes water. He was breathing </p><p>in great, choky gasps, but the period of rest—short </p><p>as it was—had enabled him to rise and stagger on. </p><p>He crawled painfully to the top of the slope, and </p><p>looked back. </p><p> The hill-crest on which he stood was higher than</p><p>any of those he had passed in his painful run, and he </p><p>could see clearly the whole of the purple range. </p><p>Where he was, he stood near the farther edge of the </p><p>range, which was here perhaps half a mile wide. </p><p> It was a ceaseless, undulating mass of hills and</p><p>hollows, ridges and spurs, all of them colored, pur- </p><p>ple and brown and golden-yellow, deepest black and </p><p>dingy white. And from the tips of most of the </p><p>pointed hills little wisps of vapor rose up. </p><p> A thin, dark cloud had gathered overhead. Burl</p><p>could look to the right and left and see the hills</p><p>fading into the distance, growing fainter as the </p><p>haze above them seemed to grow thicker. He saw, </p><p>too, the advancing cohorts of the army ants, creep- </p><p>ing over the tangled mass of fungus growth. They </p><p>seemed to be feeding as they went, upon the fungus </p><p>that had gathered into these incredible monstros- </p><p>ities. </p><p> The hills were living. They were not upheavals</p><p>of the ground, they were festering heaps of insanely </p><p>growing, festering mushrooms and fungus. Upon </p><p>most of them a purple mould had spread itself so. </p><p>that they seemed a range of purple hills, but here </p><p>and there patches of other vivid colors showed, and </p><p>there was a large hill whose whole side was a </p><p>brilliant golden hue. Another had tiny bright-red </p><p>spots of a strange and malignant mushroom whose </p><p>properties Burl did not know, scattered all over the </p><p>purple with which it was covered. </p><p> Burl leaned heavily upon his club and watched</p><p>dully. He could run no more. The army ants were </p><p>spreading everywhere over the mass of fungus. </p><p>They would reach him soon. </p><p> Far to the right the vapor thickened. A column</p><p>of smoke arose. What Burl did not know and would, </p><p>never know was that far down in the interior of </p><p>that compressed mass of fungus, slow oxidation </p><p>had been going on. The temperature of the interior </p><p>had been raised. In the darkness and the dampness </p><p>deep down in the hills, spontaneous combustion had </p><p>begun. </p><p> Just as the vast piles of coal the railroad com-</p><p>panies of thirty thousand years before had gathered </p><p>together sometimes began to burn fiercely in their </p><p>interiors, and just as the farmers’ piles of damp </p><p>straw or hay suddenly burst into fierce flames from </p><p>no cause, so these huge piles of tinder-like mush- </p><p>rooms had been burning slowly within themselves. </p><p> There had been no flames, because the surface</p><p>752 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>remained intact and nearly air-tight. But when </p><p>the army ants began to tear at the edible surfaces </p><p>despite the heat they encountered, fresh air found </p><p>its way to the smouldering masses of fungus. The </p><p>slow combustion became rapid combustion. The </p><p>dull heat became fierce flames. The slow trickle of </p><p>thin smoke became a huge column of thick, chok- </p><p>ing, acrid stuff that set the army ants that breathed </p><p>it into spasms of convulsive writhing. </p><p> From a dozen points the flames burst out. A</p><p>dozen or more columns of blinding smoke rose to the </p><p>heavens. A pall of fume-laden smoke gathered </p><p>above the range of purple hills, while Burl watched </p><p>apathetically. And the serried ranks of army ants </p><p>marched on to the widening furnaces that awaited </p><p>them. </p><p> They had recoiled from the river, because their</p><p>instinct had warned them. Thirty thousand years </p><p>without danger from fire, however, had let their </p><p>racial fear of fire die out. They marched into the </p><p>blazing orifices they had opened in the hills, snap- </p><p>ping with their mandibles at the leaping flames, </p><p>springing at the glowing tinder. </p><p> The blazing areas widened, as the purple surface</p><p>was undermined and fell in. Burl watched the </p><p>phenomenon without comprehension and even with- </p><p>out thankfulness. He stood, panting more and </p><p>more slowly, breathing more and more easily, until </p><p>the glow from the approaching flames reddened his </p><p>skin and the acrid smoke made tears flow from his </p><p>eyes. </p><p> Then he retreated slowly, leaning on his club and</p><p>looking back. The black wave of the army ants </p><p>was sweeping into the fire, sweeping into the in- </p><p>credible heat of that carbonized material burning </p><p>with an open flame. At last there were only the </p><p>little bodies of stragglers from the great ant-army, </p><p>scurrying here and there over the ground their </p><p>comrades had denuded of all living things. The </p><p>bodies of the main army had vanished—burnt to </p><p>crisp ashes in the furnace of the hills. </p><p> There had been agony in that flame, dreadful</p><p>agony such as no man would like to dwell upon. </p><p>The insane courage of the ants, attacking with their </p><p>horny jaws the burning masses of fungus, rolling </p><p>over and over with a flaming missile clutched in </p><p>their mandibles, sounding their shrill war-cry while </p><p>cries of agony came from them—blinded, their </p><p>antennae burnt off, their lidless eyes scorched by the </p><p>licking flames, yet going madly forward on flaming</p><p>feet to attack, ever attack this unknown and un- </p><p>knowable enemy. </p><p> Burl made his way slowly over the hills. Twice</p><p>he saw small bodies of the army ants. They had </p><p>passed between the widening surfaces their com- </p><p>rades had opened, and they were feeding voraciously </p><p>upon the hills they trod on. Once Burl was spied, </p><p>and a shrill war-cry was sounded, but he moved </p><p>on, and the ants were busily eating. A single ant </p><p>rushed toward him. Burl brought down his club </p><p>and a writhing body remained, to be eaten later by </p><p>its comrades when they came upon it. </p><p> Again night fell. The sky grew red in the west,</p><p>though the sun did not shine through the ever- </p><p>present cloud bank. Darkness spread across the </p><p>sky. Utter blackness fell over the whole mad world, </p><p>save where the luminous mushrooms shed their </p><p>pale light upon the ground and fireflies the length </p><p>of Burl’s arm shed their fitful gleams upon an earth </p><p>of fungus growths and monstrous insects. </p><p> Burl made his way across the range of mush-</p><p>room hills, picking his path with his large blue </p><p>eyes whose pupils expanded to great size. Slowly, </p><p>from the sky, now a drop and then a drop, now a </p><p>drop and then a drop, the nightly rain that would </p><p>continue until daybreak began. </p><p> Burl found the ground hard beneath his feet. He</p><p>listened keenly for sounds of danger. Something </p><p>rustled heavily in a thicket of mushrooms a hun- </p><p>dred yards away. There were sounds of preening, </p><p>and of delicate feet placed lightly here and there </p><p>upon the ground. Then the throbbing beat of huge </p><p>wings began suddenly, and a body took to the air. </p><p> A fierce, down-coming current of air smote Burl,</p><p>and he looked upward in time to catch the outline </p><p>of a huge body—a moth—as it passed above him. </p><p>He turned to watch the line of its flight, and saw </p><p>a strange glow in the sky behind him. The mush- </p><p>room hills were still burning. </p><p> He crouched beneath a squat toadstool and waited</p><p>for the dawn, his club held tightly in his hands, and </p><p>his ears alert for any sound of danger. The slow- </p><p>dropping, sodden rain kept on. It fell with irre- </p><p>gular, drum-like beats upon the tough top of the </p><p>toadstool under which he had taken refuge. </p><p> Slowly, slowly, the sodden rainfall continued.</p><p>Drop by drop, all the night long, the warn pellets </p><p>of liquid came from the sky. They boomed upon </p><p>the hollow heads of the toadstools, and splashed in- </p><p>to the steaming pools that lay festering all over the</p><p>fungus-covered earth. </p><p> And all the night long the great fires grew and</p><p>spread in the mass of already half-carbonized mush- </p><p>room. The flare at the horizon grew brighter and </p><p>nearer. Burl, naked and hiding beneath a huge </p><p>mushroom, wondering, with wide eyes, what this </p><p>thing was, watched it grow near him. He had never </p><p>seen a flame before. </p><p> The overhanging clouds were brightened by the</p><p>flames. Over a stretch at least a dozen miles in </p><p>length and from half a mile to three miles across, </p><p>seething furnaces sent columns of dense smoke up </p><p>to the roof of clouds, luminous from the glow be- </p><p>low them, and spreading out and forming an inter- </p><p>mediate layer below the cloudbanks themselves. </p><p> It wras like the glow of all the many lighls of a</p><p>vast city thrown against the sky—but the last great </p><p>city had moulded into fungus-covered rubbish thirty </p><p>thousand years before. Like the flitting of air- </p><p>planes above a populous city, too, was the flitting of </p><p>fascinated creatures above the glow. </p><p> Moths and great flying beetles, gigantic gnats</p><p>and midges, grown huge with the passing of time, </p><p>they fluttered and danced the dance of death above </p><p>the flames. As the fire grew nearer to Burl, he </p><p>could see them. </p><p> Colossal, delicately-formed creatures swooped</p><p>above the strange blaze. Moths with their riotously- </p><p>colored wings of thirty-foot spread beat the air with </p><p>mighty strokes, and their huge eyes glowed like </p><p>carbuncles as they stared with the frenzied gaze </p><p>of intoxicated devotees into the glowing flames be- </p><p>low them. </p><p> Burl saw a great peacock moth soaring above the</p><p>burning mushroom hills. Its wings were all of </p><p>forty feet across, and fluttered like gigantic sails </p><p>THE MAD PLANET. </p><p>753 </p><p>as the moth gazed down at the flaming furnace be- </p><p>low. The separate flames had united, now, and a </p><p>single sheet of white-hot burning stuff spread across </p><p>the country for miles, sending up its clouds of </p><p>smoke, in which and through which the fascinated </p><p>creatures flew. </p><p> Feathery antennse of the finest lace spread out</p><p>before the head of the peacock moth, and its body </p><p>was softest, richest velvet. A ring of snow-white </p><p>down marked where its head began, and the red </p><p>glow from below smote on the maroon of its body </p><p>with a strange effect. </p><p> For one instant it was outlined clearly. Its eyes</p><p>glowed more redly than any ruby’s fire, and the </p><p>great, delicate wings were poised in flight. Burl </p><p>caught the flash of the flumes upon two great irides- </p><p>cent spots upon the wide-spread wings. Shining </p><p>purple and vivid red, the glow of opal and the </p><p>sheen of pearl, all the glory of chalcedony and of </p><p>chrysoprase formed a single wonder in the red </p><p>glare of burning fungus. White smoke compassed </p><p>the great moth all about, dimming the radiance of its </p><p>gorgeous dress. </p><p> Burl saw it dart straight into the thickest and</p><p>brightest of the licking flames, flying madly, eagerly, </p><p>into the searing, hellish heat as a willing, drunken </p><p>sacrifice to the god of fire. </p><p> Monster flying beetles with their horny wing-</p><p>cases stiffly stretched, blundered above the reeking, </p><p>smoking pyre. In the red light from before them </p><p>they shone like burnished metal, and their clumsy </p><p>bodies with the spurred and fierce-toothed limbs </p><p>darted like so many grotesque meteors through the </p><p>luminous haze of ascending smoke. </p><p> Burl saw strange collisions and still stranger</p><p>meetings. Male and female flying creatures cir- </p><p>cled and spun in the glare, dancing their dance of </p><p>love and death in the wild radiance from the funeral </p><p>pyre of the purple hills. They mounted higher </p><p>than Burl could see, drunk with the ecstacy of liv- </p><p>ing, then descended to plunge headlong to death in </p><p>the roaring fires beneath them. </p><p> From every side the creatures came. Moths of</p><p>brightest yellow with soft and furry bodies pal- </p><p>pitant with life flew madly into the column of light </p><p>that reached to the overhanging clouds, then moths </p><p>of deepest black with gruesome symbols upon their </p><p>wings came swiftly to dance, like motes in sunlight, </p><p>above the glow.</p><p> And Burl sat crouched beneath an overshadowing</p><p>toadstool and watched, Thc perpetual, slow, sod- </p><p>den raindrops fell. A continual faint hissing pene- </p><p>trated the sound of the fire—the raindrops being </p><p>turned to steam. The air was alive with flying </p><p>things. From far away Burl heard a strange, deep </p><p>bass muttering. He did not know the cause, but </p><p>there was a vast swamp, of the existence of which </p><p>he was ignorant, some ten or fifteen miles away, </p><p>and the chorus of insect-eating giant frogs reached </p><p>his ears even at that distance. </p><p> The night wore on, while the flying creatures</p><p>above the fire danced and died, their numbers ever </p><p>recruited by fresh arrivals. Burl sat tensely still, </p><p>his wide eyes watching everything, his mind grop- </p><p>ing for an explanation of what he saw. At last the </p><p>sky grew dimly gray, then brighter, and day came </p><p>on. The flames of the burning hills grew faint as </p><p>the fire died down, and after a long time Burl crept </p><p>from his hiding-place and stood erect. </p><p> A hundred yards from where he was, a straight</p><p>wall of smoke rose from the still smoldering fungus, </p><p>and Burl could see it stretching for miles in either </p><p>direction. He turned to continue on his way, and </p><p>saw the remains of one of the tragedies of the night. </p><p> A huge moth had flown into the flames, been hor-</p><p>ribly scorched, and floundered out again. Had it </p><p>been able to fly, it would have returned to its de- </p><p>vouring deity, but now it lay immovable upon the </p><p>ground, its antenna* seared hopelessly, one beauti- </p><p>ful, delicate wing burned in gaping holes, its eyeg </p><p>dimmed by flame and its exquisitely tapering limbs </p><p>broken and crushed by the force with which it had </p><p>struck the ground. It lay helpless upon the earth, </p><p>only the stumps of its antennse moving restlessly, </p><p>and its abdomen pulsating slowly as it drew pain- </p><p>racked breaths. </p><p> Burl drew near and picked up a stone. He moved</p><p>on presently, a velvet cloak cast over his shoulders, </p><p>gleaming with all the colors of the rainbow. A </p><p>gorgeous mass of soft, blue moth fur was about his </p><p>middle, and he had bound upon his forehead two </p><p>yard-long, golden fragments of the moth’s magnifi- </p><p>cent antennae. He strode on slowly, clad as no man </p><p>had been clad in all the ages. </p><p> After a little he secured a spear and took up his</p><p>journey to Saya, looking like a prince of Ind upon </p><p>a bridal journey—though no mere prince ever wore </p><p>such raiment in days of greatest glory. </p><p>CHAPTER V.</p><p>The Conqueror </p><p>FOR many long miles Burl threaded his way} </p><p>through a single forest of thin-stalked toad- </p><p>stools. They towered three man-heights high, </p><p>and all about their bases were streaks and splashes </p><p>of the rusts and molds that preyed upon them* </p><p>Twice Burl came to open glades, wherein open, </p><p>bubbling pools of green sfirae festered in corruption, </p><p>and once he hid himself fearfully as a monster </p><p>scarabeus beetle lumbered within three yards of </p><p>him, moving heavily onward with a clanking of </p><p>limbs as of some mighty machine. </p><p> Burl saw the mighty armor and the inward-curv-</p><p>ing jaws of the creature, and envied him his </p><p>weapons. The time was not yet come, however, </p><p>when Burl would smile at the great insect and hunt </p><p>him for the juicy flesh contained in those armored </p><p>limbs. </p><p> Burl was still a savage, still ignorant, still timid.</p><p>His principal advance had been that whereas he had </p><p>fled without reasoning, he now paused to see if he </p><p>need flee. In his hands he bore a long, sharp- </p><p>pointed, chitinous spear. It had been the weapon </p><p>of a huge, unnamed flying insect scorched td </p><p>death in the burning of the purple hills, which had </p><p>floundered out of the flames to die. Burl had </p><p>worked for an hour before being able to detach </p><p>the weapon he coveted. It was as long and longer </p><p>than Burl himself. </p><p> He was a strange sight, moving slowly and cau-</p><p>tiously through the shadowed lanes of the mush- </p><p>room forest. A cloak of delicate velvet in which all </p><p>the colors of the rainbow played in iridescent beauty; </p><p>hung from his shoulders. A mass of soft and beau- </p><p>754 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>tiful moth fur was about his middle, and in the </p><p>strip of sinew about his waist the fiercely toothed </p><p>limb of a fighting beetle was thrust carelessly. He </p><p>had bound to his forehead twin sacks of a great </p><p>moth’s feathery golden antennas. </p><p> Against the play of color that came from his bor-</p><p>rowed plumage his pink skin showed in odd con- </p><p>trast. He looked like some proud knight walking </p><p>slowly through the gardens of a goblin’s castle. But </p><p>he was still a fearful creature, no more than the </p><p>monstrous creatures about him save in the posses- </p><p>sion of latent intelligence. He was weak—and </p><p>therein lay his greatest promise. A hundred thou- </p><p>sand years before him his ancestors had been forced </p><p>by lack of claws and fangs to develop brains. </p><p> Burl was sunk as low as they had been, but he</p><p>had to combat more horrifying enemies, more inex- </p><p>orable threatenings, and many times more crafty </p><p>assailants. His ancestors had invented knives and </p><p>spears and flying missiles. The creatures about </p><p>Burl had knives and spears a thousand times more </p><p>deadly than the weapons that had made his ances- </p><p>tors masters of the woods and forests. </p><p> Burl was in comparison vastly more weak than</p><p>his forbears had been, and it was that weakness </p><p>that in times to come would lead him and those </p><p>who followed him to heights his ancestors had never </p><p>known. But now— </p><p> He heard a discordant, deep bass bellow, coming</p><p>from a spot not twenty yards away. In a flash of </p><p>panic he darted behind a clump of the mushrooms </p><p>and hid himself, panting in sheer terror. He </p><p>waited for an instant in frozen fear, motionless and </p><p>tense. His wide, blue eyes were glassy. </p><p> The bellow came again, but this time with a</p><p>querulous note. Burl heard a crashing and plunging </p><p>as of some creature caught in a snare. A mush- </p><p>room fell with a brittle snapping, and the spongy </p><p>thud as it fell to the ground was followed by a </p><p>tremendous commotion. Something was fighting </p><p>desperately against something else, but Burl did </p><p>not know what creature or creatures might be in </p><p>combat. </p><p> He waited for a long time, and the noise gradu-</p><p>ally died away. Presently Burl’s breath came more </p><p>slowly, and his courage returned. He stole from his </p><p>hiding-place, and would .have made away, but some- </p><p>thing held him back. Instead of creeping from the </p><p>scene, he crept cautiously over toward the source of</p><p>the noise. </p><p> He peered between two cream-colored toadstool</p><p>stalks and saw the cause of the noise. A wide, fun- </p><p>nel-shaped snare of silk was spread out before him, </p><p>some twenty yards across and as many deep. The </p><p>individual threads could be plainly seen, but in the </p><p>mass it seemed a fabric of sheerest, finest texture. </p><p>Held up by the tall mushrooms, it was anchored to </p><p>the ground below, and drew away to a tiny point </p><p>through which a hole gave on some yet unknown re- </p><p>cess. And all the space of the wide snare was </p><p>hung with threads, fine, twisted threads no more </p><p>than half the thickness of Burl’s finger. </p><p> This was the trap of a labyrinth spider. Not one</p><p>of the interlacing threads was strong enough to </p><p>hold the feeblest of prey, but the threads were there </p><p>by thousands. A great cricket had become en- </p><p>tangled in the maze of sticky lines. Its limbs </p><p>thrashed out, smashing the snare-lines at every </p><p>stroke, but at every stroke meeting and becoming </p><p>entangled with a dozen more. It thrashed about </p><p>mightily, emitting at intervals the horrible, deep </p><p>bass cry that the chirping voice of the cricket had </p><p>become with its increase in size. </p><p> Burl breathed more easily, and watched with a</p><p>fascinated curiosity. Mere death—even tragic </p><p>death—as among insects held no great interest for </p><p>him. It was a matter of such common and matter- </p><p>of-fact occurrence that he was not greatly stirred. </p><p>But a spider and his prey was another matter. </p><p> There were few insects that deliberately sought</p><p>man. Most insects have their allotted victims, and </p><p>will touch no others, but spiders have a terrifying </p><p>impartiality. One great beetle devouring another </p><p>was a matter of indifference to Burl. A spider de- </p><p>vouring some luckless insect was but an example </p><p>of what might happen to him. He watched alertly, </p><p>his gaze travelling from the emmeshed cricket to </p><p>the strange orifice at the rear of the funnel-shaped </p><p>snare. </p><p> The opening darkened. Two shining, glistening</p><p>eyes had been watching from the rear of the fun- </p><p>nel. It drew itself into a tunnel there, in which </p><p>the spider had been waiting. Now it swung out </p><p>lightly and came toward the cricket. It was a gray </p><p>spider (Agelena labyrintkica), with twin black rib- </p><p>bons upon its thorax, next the head, and with two </p><p>stripes of curiously speckled brown and white upon </p><p>its abdomen. Burl saw, too, two curious appendages </p><p>like a tail. </p><p> It came nimbly out of its tunnel-like hiding-place</p><p>and approached the cricket. The cricket was strug- </p><p>gling only feebly now, and the cries it uttered were </p><p>but feeble, because of the confining threads that </p><p>fettered its limbs. Burl saw the spider throw itself </p><p>upon the cricket and saw the final, convulsive shud- </p><p>der of the insect as the spider’s fangs pierced its </p><p>tough armor. The sting lasted a long time, and </p><p>finally Burl saw that the spider was really feeding. </p><p>All the succulent juices of the now dead cricket were </p><p>being sucked from its body by the spider. It had </p><p>stung the cricket upon the haunch, and presently it </p><p>went to the other leg and drained that, too, by means </p><p>of its powerful internal suction-pump. When the </p><p>second haunch had been sucked dry, the spider </p><p>pawed the lifeless creature for a few moments and </p><p>left it. </p><p> Food was plentiful, and the spider could afford</p><p>to be dainty in its feeding. The two choicest titbits </p><p>had been consumed. The remainder could be dis- </p><p>carded. </p><p> A sudden thought came to Burl and quite took his</p><p>breath away. For a second his knees knocked to- </p><p>gether in self-induced panic. He watched the gray </p><p>spider carefully, with growing determination in his </p><p>eyes. He, Burl, had killed a hunting-spider upon </p><p>the red-clay cliff. True, the killing had been an </p><p>accident, and had nearly cost him his own life a few </p><p>minutes later in the web-spider’s snare, but he had </p><p>killed a spider, and of the most deadly kind. </p><p> Now, a great ambition was growing in Burl’S</p><p>heart. His tribe had always feared spiders too </p><p>much to know much of their habits, but they knew </p><p>one or two things. The most important was that </p><p>the snare-spiders never left their lairs to hunt-^ </p><p>never! Burl was about to make a daring applica- </p><p>tion of that knowledge. </p><p>THE MAD PL'ANET </p><p>755 </p><p> Ho drew back from the white and shining snare</p><p>and crept softly to the rear. The fabric gathered </p><p>itself into a point and then continued for some </p><p>twenty feet as a tunnel, in which the spider waited </p><p>while dreaming of its last meal and waiting for </p><p>the next victim to become entangled in the laby- </p><p>rinth in front. Burl made his way to a point where </p><p>the tunnel was no more than ten feet away, and </p><p>waited. </p><p> Presently, through the interstices of the silk, he</p><p>saw the gray bulk of the spider. It had left the ex- </p><p>hausted body of the cricket, and returned to its </p><p>resting-place. It settled itself carefully upon the </p><p>soft walls of the tunnel, w’ith its shining eyes fixed </p><p>upon the tortuous threads of its trap. Burl’s </p><p>hair was standing straight up upon his head from </p><p>sheer fright, but he was the slave of an idea. </p><p> He drew near and poised his spear, his new and</p><p>sharp spear, taken from the body of an unknown </p><p>dying creature killed by the burning purple hills. </p><p>Burl raised the spear and aimed its sharp and </p><p>deadly point at the thick gray bulk he could see </p><p>dimly through the threads of the tunnel. He thrust </p><p>it home with all his strength—and ran away at the </p><p>top of his speed, glassy-eyed from terror. </p><p> A long time later he ventured near again, his</p><p>heart in his mouth, ready to flee at the slightest </p><p>sound. All was still. Burl had missed the hor- </p><p>rible convulsions of the wounded spider, had not </p><p>heard the frightful gnashings of its fangs as it </p><p>gnashed at the piercing weapon, had not seen the </p><p>silken threads of the tunnel ripped and torn as the </p><p>spider—hurt to death—had struggled with insane </p><p>strength to free itself. </p><p> He came back beneath the overshadowing toad-</p><p>stools, stepping quietly and cautiously, to find a </p><p>great rent in the silken tunnel, to find the great </p><p>gray bulk lifeless and still, half-fallen through the </p><p>opening the spear had first made. A little puddle </p><p>of evil-smelling liquid lay upon the ground below </p><p>the body, and from time to time a droplet fell from </p><p>the spear into the puddle with a curious splash. </p><p> Burl looked at what he had done, saw the dead</p><p>body of the creature he had slain, saw the ferocious </p><p>mandibles, and the keen and deadly fangs. The </p><p>dead eyes of the creature still stared at him malig- </p><p>nantly, and the hairy legs were still braced as if </p><p>further to enlarge, the gaping hole through which </p><p>it had partly fallen. </p><p> Exultation filled Burl’s heart. His tribe had been</p><p>but furtive vermin for thousands of years, fleeing </p><p>from the mighty insects, and, hiding from them, if </p><p>overtaken, but waiting helplessly for death, scream- </p><p>ing shrilly in terror. </p><p> He, Burl, had turned the tables. He had slain</p><p>one of the enemies of his tribe. His breast ex- </p><p>panded. Always his tribesmen went quietly and </p><p>fearfully, making no sound. But a sudden, exul- </p><p>tant yell burst from Burl’s lips—the first hunting </p><p>cry from the lips of a man in a hundred centuries! </p><p> The next second his pulse nearly stopped in sheer</p><p>panic at having made such a noise. He listened </p><p>fearfully, but there was no sound. He drew near </p><p>his prey and carefully withdrew his spear. The vis- </p><p>cid liquid made it slimy and slippery, and he had </p><p>to wipe it dry against a leathery toadstool. Then </p><p>Burl had 'to conquer his logical fear again before </p><p>daring to touch the creature he had slain. </p><p> He moved off presently, with the belly of the</p><p>spider upon his back and two of the hairy legs over </p><p>his shoulders. The other limbs of the monster hung </p><p>limp, and trailed upon the ground. Burl was now </p><p>a still more curious sight as a gayly colored object </p><p>with a cloak shining in iridescent colors, the golden </p><p>antennse of a great moth rising from his forehead, </p><p>and the hideous bulk of a gray spider for a burden. </p><p> He moved through the thin-stalked mushroom</p><p>forest, and because of the thing he carried all crea- </p><p>tures fled before him. They did not fear man— </p><p>their instinct was slow-moving—but during all the </p><p>millions of years that insects have existed, there </p><p>have existed spiders to prey upon them. So Burl </p><p>moved on in solemn state, a brightly clad man bent </p><p>beneath the weight of a huge and horrible monster. </p><p> He came upon a valley full of torn and blackened</p><p>mushrooms. There was not a single yellow top </p><p>among them. Every one had been infested with </p><p>tiny maggots which had liquefied the tough meat </p><p>of the mushroom and caused it to drip to the </p><p>ground below. And all the liquid had gathered in a </p><p>golden pool in the center of the small depression. </p><p>Burl heard a loud humming and buzzing before he </p><p>topped the rise that opened the valley for his in- </p><p>spection. He stopped a moment and looked down. </p><p> A golden-red lake, its center reflecting the hazy</p><p>sky overhead. All about, blackened mushrooms, </p><p>seeming to have been charred and burned by a fierce </p><p>flame. A slow-flowing golden brooklet trickled </p><p>slowly over a rocky ledge, into the larger pool. And </p><p>all about the edges of the golden lake, in ranks </p><p>and rows, by hundreds, thousands, and by millions,</p><p>w'ere ranged the green-gold, shining bodies of great </p><p>flies. </p><p> They were small as compared with the other in-</p><p>sects. They had increased in size but a fraction of </p><p>the amount that the bees, for example, had in- </p><p>creased ; but it was due to an imperative necessity </p><p>of their race. </p><p> The flesh-flies iaid their eggs by hundreds in de-</p><p>caying carcasses. The others laid their eggs by hun- </p><p>dreds in the mushrooms. To feed the maggots that </p><p>would hatch, a relatively great quantity of food </p><p>was needed, therefore the flies must remain com- </p><p>paratively small, or the body of a single grasshop- </p><p>per, say, would furnish food for but two or three </p><p>grubs instead of the hundreds it must support. </p><p> Burl stared down at the golden pool. Bluebottles,</p><p>greenbottles, and all the flies of metallic luster were </p><p>gathered at the Lucullan feast of corruption. Their </p><p>buzzing as they darted above the odorous pool of </p><p>golden liquid made the sound Burl had heard. Their </p><p>bodies flashed and glittered as they darted back and </p><p>forth, seeking a place to alight and join in the orgy. </p><p> Those which clustered about the banks of the</p><p>pool were still as if carved from metal. Their huge, </p><p>red eyes glowed, and their bodies shone with an </p><p>obscene fatness. Flies are the most digusting of </p><p>all insects. Burl watched them a moment, watched </p><p>the interlacing streams of light as they buzzed </p><p>eagerly above the pool, seeking a place at the festive </p><p>board. </p><p> A drumming roar sounded in the air. A golden</p><p>speck appeared in the sky, a slender, needlelike body </p><p>with transparent, shining wings and two huge eyes. </p><p>It grew nearer and became a dragon-fly twenty feet </p><p>and more in length, its body shimmering, purest </p><p>766 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>gold. It poised itself above thc pool and then </p><p>darted down. Its jaws snapped viciously and re- </p><p>peatedly, and at each snapping the glittering body </p><p>of a fly vanished. </p><p> A second dragon-fly appeared, its body a vivid</p><p>purple, and a third. They swooped and rushed </p><p>above the golden pool, snapping in mid air, turning </p><p>their abrupt, angular turns, creatures of incredible </p><p>ferocity and beauty. At the moment they were noth- </p><p>ing more or less than slaughtering-machines. They </p><p>darted here and there, their many-faceted eyes </p><p>burning with blood-lust. In that mass of buzzing </p><p>flies even the most voracious appetite must be </p><p>sated, but the dragon-flies kept on. Beautiful, </p><p>slender, graceful creatures, they dashed here and </p><p>there above the pond like avenging fiends or the </p><p>mythical dragons for which they had been named. </p><p> And the loud, contented buzzing kept on as be-</p><p>fore. Their comrades were being slaughtered by </p><p>hundreds not fifty feet above their heads, but the </p><p>glittering rows of red-eyed flies gorging themselves </p><p>upon the golden, evil-smelling liquid kept placidly </p><p>on with their feasting. The dragon-flies could con- </p><p>tain no more, even of their chosen prey, but they </p><p>continued to swoop madly above the pool, striking </p><p>down the buzzing flies even though the bodies </p><p>must perforce drop uneaten. One or two of the </p><p>dead flies—crushed to a pulp by the angry jaws </p><p>of a great dragon-fly—dropped among its feasting </p><p>brothers. They shook themselves. </p><p> Presently one of them placed its disgusting pro-</p><p>boscis upon the mangled form and sipped daintily </p><p>of the juices exuding from the broken armor. </p><p>Another joined it, and another. In a little while a </p><p>cluster of them elbowed and pushed each other for </p><p>a chance to join in the cannibalistic feast. </p><p> Burl turned aside and went on, while the slim</p><p>forms of the dragon-flies still darted here and </p><p>there above the pool, still striking down the dron- </p><p>ing flies with vengeful strokes of their great jaws, </p><p>while a rain of crushed bodies was falling to the </p><p>contented, glistening, horde below. </p><p> Only a few miles farther on Burl came upon a</p><p>familiar landmark He knew it well, but from a </p><p>safe distance as always. A mass of rock had heaved </p><p>itself up from the nearly level plain over which he </p><p>was traveling, and formed an outjutting clilT. At </p><p>one point the rock overhung a sheer drop, making </p><p>an inverted ledge—a roof over nothingness—which </p><p>had been preempted by a hairy creature and made</p><p>into a fairylike dwelling. A white hemisphere clung </p><p>tenaciously to the rock above, and long cables </p><p>anchored it firmly. </p><p> Burl knew the place as one to be fearfully avoided.</p><p>A Clotho spider (Qlotho Durandi), had built itself </p><p>a nest there, from which it emerged to hunt the </p><p>unwary. Within that half-globe there was a mon- </p><p>ster, resting upon a cushion of softest silk. But </p><p>if one went too near, one of the little inverted arches, </p><p>seemingly firmly closed by a wall of silk, would open </p><p>and a creature out of a dream of hell emerge, to run </p><p>with fiendish agility toward its prey. </p><p> Surely, Burl knew the place. Hung upon the</p><p>outer walls of the silken palace were stones and </p><p>tiny boulders, discarded fragments of former meals, </p><p>and the gutted armor from limbs of ancient prey. </p><p>But what caused Burl to know the place most surely </p><p>and most tembly was another decoration that </p><p>dangled from the castle of this insect ogre. This </p><p>was the shrunken, dessicated figure of a man, all its </p><p>juices extracted and the life gone. </p><p> The death of that man had saved Burl's life two</p><p>years before. They had been together, seeking a </p><p>new source of edible mushrooms for food. The </p><p>Clotho spider was a hunter, not a spinner of snares. </p><p>It sprang suddenly from behind a great puff-ball, </p><p>and the two men froze in terror. Then it came </p><p>swiftly forward and deliberately chose its victim. </p><p>Burl had escaped when the other man was seized. </p><p>Now he looked meditatively at the hiding-place of </p><p>his ancient enemy. Some day— </p><p> But now he passed on. He went past the thicket</p><p>in which the great moths hid during the day, and </p><p>past the pool—a turgid thing of slime and yeast—1 </p><p>in which a monster water-snake lurked. He pene- </p><p>trated the little wood of the shining mushrooms </p><p>that gave out light at night, and the shadowed place </p><p>where the truffle-hunting beetles went chirping </p><p>thunderously during the dark hours. </p><p> And then he saw Saya. He caught a flash of pink</p><p>skin vanishing behind the thick stalk of a squat </p><p>toadstool, and ran forward, calling her name. She </p><p>appeared, and saw the figure with the horrible bulk </p><p>of the spider upon its back. She cried out in hor- </p><p>ror, and Burl understood. He let his burden fall </p><p>and went swiftly toward her. </p><p> They met. Saya waited timidly until she saw who</p><p>this man was, and then astonishment went over her </p><p>face. Gorgeously attired, in an iridescent cloak </p><p>from the whole wing of a great moth, with a strip </p><p>of softest fur from a night-flying creature about</p><p>his middle, with golden, feathery antennse bound </p><p>upon his forehead, and a fierce spear in his hands </p><p>:—this was not the Burl she had known. </p><p> But then he moved slowly toward her, filled with</p><p>a fierce delight at seeing her again, thrilling with </p><p>joy at the slender gracefulness of her form and the </p><p>dark richness of her tangled hair. He held out his </p><p>hands and touched her shyly. Then, manlike, he be- </p><p>gan to babble excitedly of the things that had hap- </p><p>pened to him, and dragged her toward his great </p><p>victim, the gray-bellied spider. </p><p> Saya trembled when she saw the furry bulk lying</p><p>upon the ground, and would have fled when Burl </p><p>advanced and took it up upon his back. Then </p><p>something of the pride that filled him came vicar- </p><p>iously to her. She smiled a flashing smile, and </p><p>Burl stopped short in his excited explanation. He </p><p>was suddenly tongue-tied. His eyes became plead- </p><p>ing and soft. He laid the huge spider at her feet </p><p>and spread out his hands imploringly. </p><p> Thirty thousand years of savagery had not les-</p><p>sened the feminity in Saya. She became aware </p><p>that Burl was her slave, that these wonderful things </p><p>he wore and had done were as nothing if she did not </p><p>approve. She drew away—saw the misery in Burl's </p><p>face—and abruptly ran into his arms and clung to </p><p>him, laughing happily. And quite suddenly Burl </p><p>saw with extreme clarity that all these things he </p><p>had done, even the slaying of a great spider, were </p><p>of no importance whatever beside this most won- </p><p>derful thing that had just happened, and told Saya </p><p>so quite humbly, but holding her very close to him </p><p>as he did so. </p><p> And so Burl came back fa his tribe. He had</p><p>left it neal-ly naked, with but a wisp of moth-wing </p><p>THE MAD PLANET </p><p>twisted about his middle, a timid, fearful, trembling </p><p>creature. He returned in triumph, walking slowly </p><p>and fearlessly down a broad lane of golden mush- </p><p>rooms toward the hiding place of his people. </p><p> Upon his shoulders was draped a great and many-</p><p>colored cloak made from the whole of a moth's wing. </p><p>Soft fur was about his middle. A spear was in his </p><p>hand and a fierce club at his waist. He and Saya </p><p>bore between them the dead body of a huge spider </p><p>—aforetime the dread of the pink-skinned, naked </p><p>men. </p><p> But to Burl the most important thing of all was</p><p>that Saya walked beside him openly, acknowledging </p><p>him before all the tribe. </p><p>The End </p><p>- </p><p>NEXJT MONTH </p><p> “The First Men</p><p> in the Moon</p><p>By H.

My </p><p>passage through the principal German </p><p>cities had been brilliantly marked by </p><p>balloon ascents; but as yet no German </p><p>had accompanied me in my car, and the fine experi- </p><p>ments made at Paris by MM. Greene, Eugene God- </p><p>ard, and Poitevin had not tempted the grave Teutons </p><p>to essay aerial voyages. </p><p> Eut scarcely had the news of my approaching</p><p>ascent spread through Frankfort, than three of </p><p>the principal citizens begged the favor of being </p><p>allowed to ascend with me. Two days afterwards </p><p>we were to start from the Place de la Comedie. I </p><p>began at once to get my balloon ready. It was of </p><p>silk, prepared with gutta percha; and its volume, </p><p>which was three thousand cubic yards, enabled it to </p><p>ascend to the loftiest heights. </p><p> The day of the ascent was that of the great Sep-</p><p>tember fair, which attracts so many people to </p><p>Frankfort. Lighting gas, of perfect quality and </p><p>great lifting power, had been furnished me, and </p><p>about eleven o’clock the balloon was filled; but only </p><p>three-quarters filled,—an indispensable precaution, </p><p>for, as one rises, the atmosphere diminishes in den- </p><p>sity, and the fluid enclosed within the balloon, ac- </p><p>quiring more elasticity, might burst its sides. My </p><p>calculations told me exactly the quantity of gas </p><p>necessary to carry up my companions and myself. </p><p> We were to start at noon. The impatient crowd</p><p>which pressed around the enclosed square, over- </p><p>flowing into the contiguous streets, and covering </p><p>the houses from the ground-floor to the slated </p><p>gables, presented a striking scene. </p><p> I carried three hundred pounds of ballast in bags;</p><p>the car, quite round, four feet in diameter, was </p><p>comfortably arranged; the hempen cords which sup- </p><p>ported it stretched symmetrically over the upper </p><p>hemisphere of the balloon; the compass was in place, </p><p>the barometer suspended in the circle which united </p><p>the supporting cords, and the anchor put in order. </p><p>All was now ready for </p><p>the ascent. </p><p> Among those who press-</p><p>ed around the enclosure, </p><p>I remarked a young man </p><p>with a pale face and agi- </p><p>tated features. The sight </p><p>of him impressed me.</p><p>He was' an eager specta- </p><p>tor of my ascents, whom I </p><p>had already met in sev- </p><p>eral German cities. With </p><p>an uneasy air, he closely </p><p>watched the curious </p><p>machine, as it lay motionless a few feet above the </p><p>ground; and he remained silent among those about </p><p>him. </p><p> Twelve o’clock came. The moment had arrived,</p><p>but my traveling companions did not appear. </p><p> I sent to their houses, and learnt that one had</p><p>left for Hamburg, another for Vienna, and the third </p><p>for London. Their courage had failed them at un- </p><p>dertaking one of those excursions which, thanks to </p><p>the improvement in aeronautics are free, from all </p><p>danger. As they formed, in some sort, a part .of the </p><p>programme of the day, the fear had seized them; </p><p>that they might be forced to execute it faithfully, </p><p>and they had fled far from the scene at the instant </p><p>when the balloon was being filled. Their heroism </p><p>was evidently in inverse ratio to their speed—in </p><p>decamping. </p><p> The multitude, half deceived, showed not a little</p><p>ill humor. I did not hesitate to ascend alone. In </p><p>order to re-establish the equilibrium between the </p><p>specific gravity of the balloon and the weight which </p><p>had thus proved wanting, I replaced my companions </p><p>by more sacks of sand, and got into the car. The </p><p>twelve men who had held the balloon by twelve cords, </p><p>let these slip a little between their fingers, and the </p><p>balloon rose several feet higher. There was not a </p><p>breath of wind, and the atmosphere was so laden </p><p>that it seemed to forbid the ascent. </p><p> “Is everything ready?” I cried.</p><p> The men put themselves in readiness. A last</p><p>glance told me that I might go. “Attention!” </p><p> There was a movement in the crowd, which seem-</p><p>ed to be invading the enclosure. </p><p> “Let go!”</p><p> The balloon rose slowly, but I experienced a shock</p><p>which threw me to the bottom of the car. </p><p> When I got up, I found myself face to face with</p><p>an unexpected fellow-voyager,—the pale young </p><p>man. </p><p> “Monsieur, I salute you,” said he, with utmost</p><p>coolness. </p><p> “By what right-”</p><p> “Am I here?, By the right which the impossi-</p><p>bility of your getting rid of me confers.” </p><p> I was amazed! His calmness put me out of coun-</p><p>tenance, and I had nothing to reply. I looked at the </p><p>intruder but he took no notice of my astonishment. </p><p> “Does my weight disarrange your equilibrium,</p><p>monsieur?” he asked. “You will permit me—” and </p><p>without waiting consent, he picked up two bags and </p><p>emptied them into space. </p><p>“Monsieur,” said I, taking the only course now </p><p>possible, “you have come; very well, you will re- </p><p>, main; but to me alone be- </p><p>longs the management of </p><p>the balloon.” </p><p> “Monsieur,” said he,</p><p>“your urbanity is French </p><p>all over: it comes from </p><p>my country. I morally </p><p>press the hand you refuse </p><p>me. Make all precautions, </p><p>and act as seems best to </p><p>you. I will wait till you </p><p>have done-” </p><p> “For what?”</p><p> “To talk with you.”</p><p> The barometer had fallen to twenty-six inches.</p><p>We were nearly six hundred yards from the city; </p><p>but nothing betrayed the horizontal displacement of </p><p>the balloon, for the mass of air in which it is en- </p><p>closed goes forward with it. A sort of confused </p><p>glow enveloped the objects spread out under us, and </p><p>fortunately obscured their outline. </p><p> I examined my companion afresh. He was a man</p><p>of thirty years, simply clad. The sharpness of his </p><p>features betrayed an indomitable energy, and he </p><p>seemed very muscular. Indifferent to the astonish- </p><p>ment he created, he remained motionless, trying in </p><p>was one of the very first stories published by </p><p> our well-known author, appearing soon after 1850.</p><p>It is perhaps not of the fine quality of some of Verne's </p><p>later works, but it is a little gem in itself, because, with- </p><p>out a doubt, it holds your interest, short as it is, has </p><p>plenty of excitement and a good deal of action. More-</p><p>over, it is not only probable, but in a newspaper account </p><p>some years ago, the identical thing happened in a slightly </p><p>different setting. It probably will happen again. We </p><p>know that you will like “A Drama in the Air." </p><p>760 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>the meantime to distinguish the objects below us. </p><p> “Miserable mist!” said he, after a few moments.</p><p> I did not reply.</p><p> “You owe me a grudge?” he went on. “Bah! I</p><p>could not pay for my journey, and it was necessary </p><p>to take you by surprise.” </p><p> “Nobody asks you to descend, monsieur!”</p><p> “Eh, do you not know, then, that the same thing</p><p>happened to the Counts of Laurencin and Dam- </p><p>pierre, when they ascended at Lyons, on the 15th </p><p>of January, 1784? A young merchant, named Fon- </p><p>taine, scaled the gallery, at the risk of capsizing the </p><p>machine. He accomplished the journey, and nobody </p><p>died of it!” </p><p> “Once on the ground, -we will have an explana-</p><p>tion,”«replied I, piqued at the light tone in which he </p><p>epolce. </p><p> “Bah! Do not let us think of our return.”</p><p> “Do you think, then, I shall not hasten to de-</p><p>scend?”’ </p><p> “Descend!” said he, in surprise. “Descend? Let</p><p>us begin by first ascending.” </p><p> And before I could prevent it, two more bags had</p><p>been thrown out of the car, without even having </p><p>been emptied. </p><p> “Monsieur!” cried I, in a rage.</p><p> “I know your ability,” replied the unknown quietly</p><p>ly, “and your fine ascents are famous. But if Ex- </p><p>perience is the sister of Practice, she is also a cousin </p><p>of Theory, and I have studied the aerial art long. </p><p>It has got into my head!” he added sadly, falling </p><p>into a silent reverie. </p><p> The balloon, having risen some distance farther,</p><p>now become stationary. The unknown consulted </p><p>the barometer and said, “Here we are, at eight </p><p>hundred yards. Men are like insects. See! I </p><p>think we should always contemplate them from this </p><p>height, to judge correctly of their proportions. The </p><p>Place de la Com6die is transformed into an im- </p><p>mense ant-hill. Observe the crowd which is gather- </p><p>ed on the quays; and the mountains also get smaller </p><p>and smaller. We are over the Cathedral. The </p><p>Main is only a line, cutting the city in two, and the </p><p>bridge seems a thread thrown between the two</p><p>banks of the river.” </p><p> The atmosphere became somewhat chilly.</p><p> “There is nothing I would not do for you, my</p><p>host,” said the unknown. “If you are cold, I will </p><p>take off my coat and lend it to you.” </p><p> “Thanks,” said I dryly.</p><p> “Bah! Necessity makes law. Give me your</p><p>hand. I am your fellow-countryman; you will learn </p><p>something in my company, and my conversation will </p><p>indemnify you for the trouble I have given you.” </p><p> I sat down, without replying, at the opposite ex-</p><p>tremity of the car. The young man drew a volumi- </p><p>nous manuscript from his coat. It was an essay on </p><p>ballooning. </p><p> “I possess,” said he, “the most curious collection</p><p>of engravings and caricatures extant concerning </p><p>aerial manias. How people admired and scoffed at </p><p>the same time at this precious discovery! We are </p><p>happily no longer in the age in which Montgolfier </p><p>tried to make artificial clouds with steam, or a gas </p><p>having electrical properties, produced by the com- </p><p>bustion of moist straw and chopped-up-wool.” </p><p> “Do you Wish to depreciate the talent of the in-</p><p>ventors?” I asked, for I had resolved to enter into </p><p>the adventure. “Was it not good to have proved by </p><p>experience the possibility of rising in the air?” </p><p> “Ah, monsieur, who denies the glory of the first</p><p>aerial navigators? It required immense courage to </p><p>rise by means of those frail envelopes which only </p><p>contained heated air. But I ask you, has the aerial </p><p>science made great progress since Blanchard’s as- </p><p>censions, that is, since nearly a century ago? Look </p><p>here, monsieur.” </p><p> The unknown took an engraving from his port-</p><p>folio. </p><p> “Here,” said he, “is the first aerial voyage un-</p><p>dertaken by Pilatre des Hosiers and the Marquis </p><p>d'Arlandes, four months after the discovery of bal- </p><p>loons. Louis XVI. refused to consent to the venture, </p><p>and two men who were condemned to death were </p><p>the first to attempt the aerial ascent. Pilatre des </p><p>Hosiers became indignant at this injustice, and, by </p><p>means of intrigues, obtained permission to make the </p><p>experiment. The car, which renders the manage- </p><p>ment easy, had not been invented, and a circular </p><p>gallery was placed around the lower and contracted </p><p>part of the Montgolfier balloon. The two aeronauts</p><p>must then remain motionless at each extremity of </p><p>this gallery, for the moist straw which filled it for- </p><p>bade them all motion. A chafing-dish with fire was </p><p>suspended below the orifice of the balloon; when the </p><p>aeronauts wished to rise, they threw straw upon </p><p>this brazier, at the risk of setting fire to the balloon, </p><p>and the aiz% more heated, acquired fresh ascending </p><p>power. The two bold travelers rose, on the 21st of </p><p>November, 1783, from the Muette Gardens, which </p><p>the dauphin had put at their disposal. The balloon </p><p>went up majestically, passed over the Isle of Swans, </p><p>crossed the Seine at the Conference barrier, and, </p><p>drifting between the dome of the Invalides and the </p><p>Military School, approached the Church of Saint </p><p>Sulpice. Then the aeronauts added to the fire, </p><p>crossed the Boulevard, and descended beyond the </p><p>Enfer barrier. As it touched the soil, the balloon </p><p>collapsed, and for a few moments buried Pilatre des </p><p>Rosiers under it folds.” </p><p> “Unlucky augury,” I said, interested in the story,</p><p>which affected me nearly. </p><p> “An augury of the catastrophe which was later</p><p>to cost this unfortunate man his life,” x-eplied the </p><p>unknown sadly. “Have you never experienced any- </p><p>thing like it?” </p><p> “Never.”</p><p> “Bah! Misfortunes sometimes occur unfore-</p><p>shadowed!” added my companion. He then remain- </p><p>ed silent.	- -</p><p> We were drifting' southward, and Frankfort had</p><p>already, passed from beneath us. </p><p> “Perhaps we shall have a storm,” said the young</p><p>man. </p><p> “We shall descend before that,” I replied.</p><p> “Better to ascend. We shall escape it more</p><p>surely.” And two more bags of sand were hurled </p><p>into space. </p><p> The balloon rose rapidly, and stopped at twelve</p><p>hundred yards. I became colder; and yet the sun's </p><p>rays, falling upon the surface, expanded the gas </p><p>within, and gave it a greater ascending force. </p><p>“Fear nothing,” said the unknown. “We have </p><p>/ </p><p>A DRAMA' IN THE AIR </p><p>761 </p><p>still three thousand five hundred fathoms of breath- </p><p>ing air. Besides, do not trouble yourself about </p><p>what I do.” </p><p> I would have risen, but a vigorous hand held me</p><p>to my seat. “Your name?” I asked. </p><p> "My name? What matters it to you?”</p><p> “I demand your name!”</p><p> “My name is Erostratus or Empedocles, which-</p><p>ever you choose!” </p><p> This reply was far from reassuring. The un-</p><p>known, besides, talked with such strange coolness </p><p>that I anxiously asked myself whom I had to deal </p><p>with. </p><p> “Monsieur,” he continued, “nothing original has</p><p>been imagined since the physicist Charles. Four </p><p>months after the discovery of balloons, this man had </p><p>invented the valve which permits the gas to escape </p><p>when the balloon is too full, or when you wish to </p><p>descend; the car, which aids the management of the </p><p>machine; the netting, which holds the envelope of </p><p>the balloon, and divides the weight over its whole </p><p>surface; the ballast, which enables you to ascend, </p><p>and to choose the place of your landing; the india- </p><p>rubber coating, which renders the tissue imperme- </p><p>able; the barometer, which shows the height at- </p><p>tained. Lastly, Charles used hydrogen, which, four- </p><p>teen times lighter than air, permits you to penetrate </p><p>to the highest atmospheric regions, and does not ex- </p><p>pose you to the dangers of a combustion in the air. </p><p>On the 1st of December, 1783, three hundred thous- </p><p>and spectators were crowded around the Tuilleries. </p><p>Charles rose, and the soldiers presented arms to </p><p>him. Ho traveled nine leagues in the air, conduct- </p><p>ing his balloon with an ability not surpassed by </p><p>modern aeronauts. The king awarded him a pen- </p><p>sion of two thousand livres; for then they encour- </p><p>aged new inventions.” </p><p> The unknown now seemed to be under tho</p><p>influence of considerable agitation. </p><p> “See, there is Darmstadt,” said he, leaning over</p><p>the car. “Do you perceive the chateau? Not very </p><p>distinctly, eh? What would you have? The heat of </p><p>the storm makes the outline of objects waver, and </p><p>you must have a skilled eye to recognize localities.” </p><p>“Are you certain it is Darmstadt? I asked. </p><p> “I am sure of it. We are now six leagues from</p><p>Frankfort.” </p><p> “Then we must descend.”</p><p> “Descend! You would not go down on the</p><p>steeples,” said the unknown, with a chuckle. </p><p> “No, but the suburbs of the city.”</p><p> “Well, let us avoid tho steeples!”</p><p> So speaking, my companion seized some bags of</p><p>ballast. I hastened to prevent him; but he over- </p><p>threw me with one hand, and the unballasted bal- </p><p>loon ascended to two thousand yards. </p><p> “Rest easy,” said he, “and do not forget that</p><p>Brioschi, Biot, Gay-Lussac, Bixio, and Barral as- </p><p>cended to still greater heights to make their scien- </p><p>tific experiments.” </p><p> “Monsieur, we must descend,” I resumed, trying</p><p>to persuade him by gentleness. “The storm is gath- </p><p>ering around us. It would be more prudent-” </p><p> “Bah! We will mount higher than the storm, and</p><p>then we shall no longer fear it!”cried my companion. </p><p>“What is nobler than to overlook the clouds which </p><p>oppress the earth? Is it not an honor thus to navi- </p><p>gate on aerial billows? The greatest men have </p><p>traveled as we are doing. The Marchioness and </p><p>Countess de Montalembert, the Countess of Podenas, </p><p>Mademoiselle la Garde, the Marquis de Montalem- </p><p>bert, rose from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine for </p><p>these unknown regions, and the Duke de Chartres </p><p>exhibited much skill and presence of mind in his </p><p>ascent on the 15th of July, 174. At Lyons, the </p><p>Counts of Laurencin and Dampierre; at Nantes, M. </p><p>de Luynes; at Bordeaux, D’Arbelet des Granges; in </p><p>Italy, the Chevalier Andreani; in our own time, the </p><p>Duke of Brunswick,—have all left traces of their </p><p>glory in the air. To equal these great personages, </p><p>we must penetrate still higher than they into the </p><p>celestial depths! To approach the infinite is to </p><p>comprehend it!” </p><p> The rarefaction of the air was fast expending tho</p><p>hydrogen in the balloon, and I saw its lower part, </p><p>purposely left empty, swell out, so that it was abso- </p><p>lutely necessary to open the valve; but my compan- </p><p>ion did not seem to intend that I should manage the </p><p>balloon as I wished. I then resolved to pull the </p><p>valve-cord secretly, as he was excitedly talking; for </p><p>I feared to guess with whom I had to deal. It would </p><p>have been too horrible! It was nearly a quarter be- </p><p>fore one. We had been gone forty minutes from </p><p>Frankfort; heavy clouds were coming against the</p><p>wind from the south, and seemed about to burst </p><p>upon us. </p><p> “Have you lost all hope of succeeding in your</p><p>project?” I asked with anxious interest. </p><p> “All hope!” exclaimed the unknown in a low voice.</p><p>“Wounded by slights and caricatures, these asses' </p><p>kicks have finished me! It is the eternal punish- </p><p>ment reserved for innovators! Look at these carica- </p><p>tures of all periods, of which my portfolio is full.” </p><p> While my companion was fumbling with his</p><p>papers, I had seized the valve-cord without his per- </p><p>ceiving it. I feared, however, that he might hear </p><p>the hissing noise, like a water-course, which the gas </p><p>makes in escaping. </p><p> “How many jokes were made about the Abb6</p><p>Moilan! said he. “He was to go up with Janninet </p><p>and Bredin. During the filling their balloon caught </p><p>fire, and the ignorant populace tore it to pieces! </p><p>Then this caricature of ‘curious animals' appeared, </p><p>giving each of them a punning nickname.” </p><p> I pulled the valve-cord, and the barometer began</p><p>to ascend. It was time. Some far-off rumblings </p><p>were heard in the south. </p><p> “Here is another engraving,” resumed the un-</p><p>known, not suspecting what I was doing. “It is an </p><p>immense balloon carrying a ship, strong castles, </p><p>houses, and so on. The caricaturists did not sus- </p><p>pect that their follies would one day become truths. </p><p>It is complete, this large vessel. On the left is its </p><p>helm, with the pilot’s box; at the prow are pleasure- </p><p>houses, an immense organ, and a cannon to call the </p><p>attention of the inhabitants of the earth or the </p><p>moon; above the poop there are the observatory and </p><p>the balloon longboat; in the equatorial circle, the </p><p>army barrack; on the left, the funnel; then the up- </p><p>per galleries for promenading, sails, pinions; below, </p><p>the caf6s and general storehouse. Observe this </p><p>pompous announcement: ‘Invented for the happiness </p><p>of the human race, this globe will depart at once for </p><p>the ports of the Levant, and on its return the pro- </p><p>762 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>gramme of its voyages to the two poles and the ex- </p><p>treme west will be announced. No one need furnish </p><p>himself with anything; everything is foreseen, and </p><p>all will prosper. Thus pleasure will be the soul of </p><p>the aerial company.' All this provoked laughter; </p><p>but before long, if I am not cut off, they will see it </p><p>all realized." </p><p> We were visibly descending. He did not perceive</p><p>itl </p><p> “This kind of ‘game at balloons,"’ he resumed,</p><p>spreading out before me some of the engravings of </p><p>his valuable collection, “this game contains the en- </p><p>tire history of the aerostatic art. It is used by </p><p>elevated minds, and displayed with dice and coun- </p><p>ters, with whatever stakes you like, to be paid or </p><p>received according to where the player arrives.” </p><p>“Why,” said I, “you seem to have studied the </p><p>science of aerostation profoundly.” </p><p> “Yes, monsieur, yes! From Phaeton, Icarus,</p><p>Architas, I have searched for, examined, learnt </p><p>everything. I could render immense services to the </p><p>world in this art, if God granted me life. But that </p><p>will not be!” </p><p> “Why?”</p><p> “Because my name is Empedocles, or Erostratus.”</p><p>Meanwhile the balloon was happily approaching </p><p>the earth; but when one is falling, the danger is as </p><p>great at a hundred feet as at five thousand. </p><p> “Do you recall the battle of Fleurus?” resumed</p><p>my companion, whose face became more and more </p><p>animated. “It was at that battle that Contello, by </p><p>order of the Government, organized a company of </p><p>balloonists. At the siege of Maubeuge General Jour- </p><p>dan 'derived so much service from this new method </p><p>of observation that Contello ascended twice a day </p><p>with the general himself. The communications be- </p><p>tween the aeronaut and his agents who held the </p><p>balloon were made by means of small white, red, </p><p>and yellow flags. Often the gun and cannon shot </p><p>were directed upon the balloon when he ascended, </p><p>but without result. Where General Jourdan was </p><p>preparing to invest Charleroi, Contello went to the </p><p>vicinity, ascended from the plain of Jumet, and con- </p><p>tinued his observations for seven or eight hours </p><p>witih General Morlot, and this no doubt aided in </p><p>giving us the victory of Fleurus. General Jourdan </p><p>publicly acknowledged the help which the aeronau- </p><p>tical observations had afforded him. Well, despite </p><p>the services rendered on that occasion and during</p><p>the Belgian campaign, the year which had seen the </p><p>beginning of the military career of balloons saw </p><p>also its end. The school of Meudon, founded by the </p><p>Government, was closed by Buonaparte on his re- </p><p>turn from Egypt. And now, what can you expect </p><p>from the new-born infant? as Franklin said. The </p><p>infant was born alive; it should not be stifled!” </p><p>The unknown bowed his head in his hands for </p><p>some moments; then rousing himself, he said, “Des- </p><p>pite my prohibition, monsieur, you have opened the </p><p>valve.” </p><p> I dropped the cord.</p><p> “Happily,” he resumed, “we have still three hun-</p><p>dred pounds of ballast.” </p><p> “What is your purpose?” said I.</p><p> “Have you ever crossed the seas ?” he asked.</p><p> I turned pale.</p><p> “It is unfortunate*” he went on, “that we are be-</p><p>ing driven towards the Adriatic. That is only a </p><p>stream; but higher up we may find other currents.” </p><p>And, without any notice of me, he threw over </p><p>several bags of sand, then, in a menacing voice, he </p><p>said, “I let you open the valve because the expand- </p><p>ing gas threatened to burst the balloon; but do not </p><p>do it again!” </p><p> Then we went on, “You remember the voyage of</p><p>Blanchard and Jeffries from Dover to Calais? It </p><p>was magnificent! On the 7th of January, 1785, </p><p>there being a north-west wind, their balloon was in- </p><p>flated with gas on the Dover coast. A mistake of </p><p>equilibrium, just as they were ascending, forced </p><p>them to throw out their ballast so that they might </p><p>not go down again, and they only kept thirty pounds. </p><p>It was too little; for, as the wind did not freshen, </p><p>they only advanced very slowly towards the French </p><p>coast. Besides, the permeability of the tissue </p><p>served to reduce the inflation little by little, and in </p><p>an hour and a half the aeronauts perceived that </p><p>they were descending. </p><p> “ ‘What shall we do?’ said Jeffries.</p><p> “ ‘We are only one quarter of the way over,’ re-</p><p>plied Blanchard, ‘and very low down. On rising, we </p><p>shall perhaps meet more favorable winds.’ </p><p> “ ‘Let us throw out the rest of the sand.’</p><p> “The balloon acquired some ascending force, but</p><p>it soon began to descend again. Towards the mid-</p><p>dle of the transit the aeronauts threw over their </p><p>books and tools. A quarter of an hour after, </p><p>Blanchard said to Jeffries, ‘The barometer?’ </p><p> “ ‘It is going up! We are lost, and yet there is</p><p>the French coast.’ </p><p> “A loud noise was heard.</p><p> “ ‘Has the balloon burst?’ asked Jeffries.</p><p> “ ‘No. The loss of the gas has reduced the in-</p><p>flation of the lower part of the balloon. But we </p><p>are still descending. We are lost! Out with every- </p><p>thing useless!’ </p><p> “Provisions, oars, and rudder were thrown into</p><p>the sea. The aeronauts were only one hundred </p><p>yards high. </p><p> “‘We are going up again,’ said the doctor.</p><p> “ ‘No. It is the spurt caused by the diminution</p><p>of the weight, and not a ship in sight, not a bark on </p><p>the horizon! To the sea with our clothing!’ </p><p> “The unfortunates stripped themselves, but the</p><p>balloon continued to descend. </p><p> “ ‘Blanchard’ said Jeffries, ‘you should have made</p><p>this voyage alone; you consented to take me; I will </p><p>sacrifice myself! I shall drop into the water, and </p><p>the balloon, relieved of my weight, will mount </p><p>again.’ </p><p> “‘No, no! It is frightful!’</p><p> “The balloon became less and less inflated, and as</p><p>it doubled up its concavity pressed the gas against </p><p>the sides, and hastened its downward course. </p><p> “ ‘Adieu,’ said the doctor. ‘God preserve you!’</p><p>“He was about to throw himself over, when </p><p>Blanchard held him back. </p><p> “ ‘There is one more chance/ said he. ‘We can cut</p><p>the cords which hold the car, and cling to the net! </p><p>Perhaps the balloon will rise. Let us hold ourselves </p><p>ready. But—the barometer is going down! The </p><p>wind is freshening! We are saved!’ </p><p> “The aeronauts preceived Calais. Their joy was</p><p>delirious, A few momanfo more, and they had </p><p>A DRAMA IN THE AIR </p><p>763 </p><p>fallen in the forest of Guines. I do not doubt,” </p><p>added the unknown, “that, under similar circum- </p><p>stances, you would have followed Doctor Jeffries' </p><p>example!” </p><p> The clouds rolled in glittering masses beneath us.</p><p>The balloon threw large shadows on them, and </p><p>was surrounded as by an aureola. The thunder </p><p>rumbled below the car. All this was terrifying. </p><p> “Let us descend!” I cried.</p><p> “Descend, when the sun is up there, waiting for</p><p>us? Out with more bags!” </p><p> And more than fifty pounds of ballast were cast</p><p>over. </p><p> At a height of three thousand five hundred yards</p><p>we remained stationary. Thc unknown talked un- </p><p>ceasingly. I was in a state of complete prostration, </p><p>while he seemed to be in his element. “With a good </p><p>wind, we shall go far,” he cried. “In the Antilles </p><p>there are currents of air which have a speed of a </p><p>hundred leagues an hour. When Napoleon was </p><p>crowned, Garnerin sent up a balloon with colored </p><p>lamps, at eleven o’clock at night. The wind was </p><p>blowing north-north-west. The next morning, at </p><p>daybreak, the inhabitants of Rome greeted its pass- </p><p>age over the dome of St. Peter’s. We shall go far- </p><p>ther and higher!” </p><p> i scarcely heard him. Everything whirled around</p><p>me. An opening appeared in the clouds. </p><p> “See that city,” said the unknown. “It is Spires!”</p><p> I leaned over the car and perceived a small black-</p><p>ish mass. It was Spires. The Rhine, which is so </p><p>large, seemed an unrolled ribbon. The sky was a </p><p>deep blue over our heads. The birds had long aban- </p><p>doned us, for in that rarefied air they could not have </p><p>flown. We were alone in space, and I in the pres- </p><p>ence of this unknown! </p><p> “It is useless for you to know whither I am lead-</p><p>ing you,” he said, as he threw the compass among </p><p>thc clouds. “Ah! a fall is a grand thing!. You </p><p>know that but few victims of ballooning are to be </p><p>reckoned, from Pilatre des Rosiers to Lieutenant </p><p>Gale, and that the accidents have always been the </p><p>result of imprudence. Pilatre des Rosiers set out </p><p>with Romain of Boulogne, on the 13th of June, </p><p>1785. To his gas balloon he had affixed a Mont- </p><p>golfier apparatus of hot air, so as to dispense, no</p><p>doubt, with the necessity of losing gas or throwing </p><p>out ballast. It was putting a torch under a powder- </p><p>barrel. When they had ascended four hundred </p><p>yards, and were taken by opposing winds, they were </p><p>driven over the open sea. Pilatre, in order to des- </p><p>cend, essayed to open the valve, but the valve-cord </p><p>became entangled in the balloon, and tore it so badly </p><p>that it became empty in an instant. It fell upon </p><p>the Montgolfier apparatus, overturned it, and drag- </p><p>ged down the unfortunates, who were soon shattered </p><p>to pieces! It is frightful, is it not?” </p><p> I could only reply, “For pity’s sake let us des-</p><p>cend !” </p><p> The clouds gathered around us on every side,</p><p>and dreadful detonations, which reverberated in </p><p>the cavity of the balloon, took place beneath us. </p><p> “You provoke me,” cried the unknown, “and you!</p><p>shall no longer know whether we are rising or fall- </p><p>ing!” </p><p> The barometer went the way of the compass, ac-</p><p>companied by several more bags of sand. We must </p><p>have been 5000 yards high. Some icicles had al- </p><p>ready attached themselves to the sides of the car, </p><p>and a kind of fine snow seemed to penetrate to my </p><p>very bones. Meanwhile a frightful tempest was </p><p>raging under us, but wTe were above it. </p><p> “Do not be afraid,” said the unknown. “It is</p><p>only the imprudent who are lost. Olivari, who </p><p>perished at Orleans, rose in a paper ‘Montgolfier ;’ </p><p>his car, suspended below the chafing-dish, and bal- </p><p>lasted with combustible materials, caught fire; </p><p>Olivari fell, and was killed! Mosment rose, at </p><p>Lille, on a light tray; an oscillation disturbed hi3 </p><p>equilibrium; Mosment fell, and was killed! Bittorf, </p><p>at Mannheim, saw his balloon catch fire in the air; </p><p>and he, too, fell, and was killed! Harris rose in a </p><p>badly constructed balloon, the valve of which wa3 </p><p>too large and would not shut; Harris fell, and was </p><p>killed! ^ Sadler, deprived of ballast by his long so- </p><p>journ in the air, was dragged over the town of </p><p>Boston and dashed against the chimneys; Sadler </p><p>fell, and was killed! Cokling descended with a; </p><p>convex parachute which he pretended to have per- </p><p>fected; Cokling fell, and was killed! Well, I love </p><p>them, these victims of their own imprudence, and </p><p>I shall die as they did. Higher! still higher!” </p><p> All the phantoms of this necrology passed before</p><p>my eyes. The rarefaction of the air and the sun's </p><p>rays added to the expansion of the gas, and the </p><p>balloon continued to mount. I tried to open the </p><p>valve, but the unknown cut the cord several feet</p><p>above my head. I was lost. </p><p> “Did you see Madame Blanchard fall?” said he*</p><p>“I saw her; yes, I! I was at Tivoli on the 6th of </p><p>July, 1819. Madame Blanchard rose in a small- </p><p>sized balloon, to avoid the expense of filling, and </p><p>she was forced to inflate it entirely. The gas leaked </p><p>out below, and left a regular train of hydrogen in </p><p>its path. She carried with her a sort of pyrotechnic </p><p>aureola, suspended below her car by a wire, which </p><p>she was to set off in the air. This she had don© </p><p>many times before. On this day she also carried up </p><p>a small parachute ballasted by a firework contri- </p><p>vance, that would go off in a shower of silver. She </p><p>was to start this contrivance after having lighted </p><p>it with a port-fire made on purpose. She set out; </p><p>the night was gloomy. At the moment of lighting </p><p>her fireworks she was so imprudent as to pass the </p><p>taper under the column of hydrogen which was </p><p>leaking from the balloon. My eyes were fixed upon </p><p>her. Suddenly an unexpected gleam lit up the </p><p>darkness. I thought she was preparing a surprise. </p><p>The light flashed out, suddenly disappeared and re- </p><p>appeared, and gave the summit of the balloon tho </p><p>shape of an immense jet of ignited gas. This </p><p>sinister glow shed itself over the Boulevard and the </p><p>whole Montmarrte quarter. Then I saw the unhappy </p><p>woman rise, try twice to close the appendage of </p><p>the balloon, so as to put out the fire, then sit down </p><p>in her car and try to guide her descent; for she did </p><p>not fall. The combustion of the gas lasted for </p><p>several minutes. The balloon, becoming gradually </p><p>less, continued to descend, but it was not a fall. Tho </p><p>wind blew from the north-west and drove it towards </p><p>Paris. There were then some large gardens just </p><p>by the house No. 16, Rue de Provence. Madame </p><p>Blanchard essayed to fall there without danger; but </p><p>the balloon and the car struck on the roof of the </p><p>764 </p><p>AMAZTNG STORIES </p><p>house with a light shock. ‘Save me!’ cried the </p><p>wretched woman. I got into the street at this </p><p>moment. The car slid along the roof, and en- </p><p>countered an iron cramp. Madame Blanchard was </p><p>thrown out of her car and precipitated upon the </p><p>pavement. She was killed!” </p><p> These stories froze me with horror. The un-</p><p>known was standing with bare head, disheveled </p><p>hair, haggard eyes! There was no longer any il- </p><p>lusion possible. I recognized the horrible truth. </p><p>I was in the presence of a madman! </p><p> He threw out the rest of the ballast, and we must</p><p>have now reached a height of at least nine thou- </p><p>sand yards. Blood spurted from my nose and </p><p>mouth! </p><p> ‘Who are nobler than the martyrs of science?”</p><p>cried the lunatic. “They are canonized by poster- </p><p>ity.” </p><p> But I no longer heard him. He bent down to my</p><p>ear and muttered, “And have you forgotten Zam- </p><p>becarri’s catastrophe? Listen. On the 7th of </p><p>October, 1804, the clouds seemed to lift a little. On </p><p>the preceding days, the wind and rain had not </p><p>ceased; but the announced ascension of Zambecarri </p><p>could not be postponed. His enemies were already </p><p>bantering him. It was necessary to ascend to save </p><p>the science and himself from becoming a public </p><p>jest. It was at Boulogne. No one helped him to </p><p>inflate his balloon. He rose at midnight, accom- </p><p>panied by Andreoli and Grossetti. The balloon </p><p>mounted slowly, for it had been perforated by the </p><p>rain, and the gas was leaking out. The three in- </p><p>trepid aeronauts could only observe the state of the </p><p>barometer by aid of a dark lantern. Zambecarri </p><p>had eaten nothing for twenty-four hours. Grossetti </p><p>was also fasting. </p><p> “ ‘My friends,’ said Zambecarri, ‘I am overcome</p><p>by cold, and exhausted. I am dying.’ </p><p> “He fell inanimate in the gallery. It was tho</p><p>same with Grossetti. Andreoli alone remained con- </p><p>scious. After long efforts, he succeeded in re- </p><p>viving Zambecarri. </p><p> “‘What news? Whither are we going? How is</p><p>the wind? What time is it?’ </p><p> “ ‘It is two o’clock.’</p><p> “ ‘Where is the compass?’</p><p> “ ‘Upset!’</p><p> “ ‘Great God! The lantern has gone out!’</p><p> “ ‘It cannot burn in this rarefied air,” said Zam-</p><p>becarri. </p><p> “The moon had not risen and the atmosphere was</p><p>plunged in murky darkness. ‘I am cold, Andreoli. </p><p>What shall I do?’ </p><p> “They slowly descended through a layer of</p><p>whitish clouds. ‘Sh!’ said Andreoli. ‘Do you hear?’ </p><p>“ ‘What?’ asked Zambecarri. </p><p> “ ‘A strange noise.’</p><p> “ ‘You are mistaken. Consider these travelers, m</p><p>the middle of the night, listening to that unaccount- </p><p>able noise! Are they going to knock, against a </p><p>tower? Are they about to be precipitated on the </p><p>roofs? ‘Do you hear? One would say it was the </p><p>sea.’ </p><p> “ ‘Impossible!’</p><p> “ ‘It is the groaning of the waves!’</p><p> “ ‘It is true.’</p><p> “‘LightI light!’ After five fruitless attempts,</p><p>Andreoli succeeded in obtaining light. It was three </p><p>o’clock. </p><p> ‘The noise of violent waves was heard. They</p><p>were almost touching the surface of the sea! ‘We </p><p>are lost!’ cried Zambecarri, seizing a bag of sand. </p><p> “ ‘Help!’ cried Andreoli.</p><p> “The car touched the water, and the waves came</p><p>up to their breasts. ‘Throw out the instruments, </p><p>clothes!’ </p><p> “The aeronauts completely stripped themselves.</p><p>The balloon, relieved, rose with frightful rapidity. </p><p>Zambecarri was taken with vomiting. Grossetti </p><p>bled profusely. The unfortunate men could not </p><p>speak, so short was their breathing. They were </p><p>taken with cold, and they were soon crusted over </p><p>with ice. The moon looked as red as blood. </p><p> “After traversing the high regions for a half-</p><p>hour, the balloon again fell into the sea. It was </p><p>four in the morning. They were half submerged </p><p>in the water, and the balloon dragged them along,</p><p>as if under sail, for several hours. </p><p> “At daybreak they found themselves opposite</p><p>Pesaro, four miles from the coast. They were </p><p>about to reach it, when a gale blew them back into </p><p>the open sea. They were lost! The frightened </p><p>boats fled at their approach. Happily, a more intel- </p><p>ligent boatman accosted them, hoisted them on </p><p>board, and they landed at Ferrada. </p><p> “A frightful journey, was it not? But Zam-</p><p>becarri was a brave and energetic man. Scarcely </p><p>recovered from his sufferings, he resumed his as- </p><p>censions. During one of them he struck against </p><p>a tree; his spirit-lamp was broken on his clothes; </p><p>he was enveloped in fire, his balloon began to catch </p><p>the flames, and he came down half consumed. </p><p> “At last, on the 21st of September, 1812, he made</p><p>another ascension at Boulogne. The balloon clung </p><p>to a tree, and his lamp again set it on fire. Zam- </p><p>becarri fell, and was killed! And in presence of </p><p>these facts, we would still hesitate! No. The </p><p>higher we go, the more glorious will be our death!” </p><p> The balloon being now entirely relieved of ballast</p><p>and of all it contained, we were carried to an enor- </p><p>mous height. It vibrated in the atmosphere. The </p><p>least noise resounded in the vaults of heaven. Our </p><p>globe, the only object which caught my view in </p><p>immensity, seemed ready to be annihilated, and </p><p>above us the depths of the starry skies were lost </p><p>in thick darkness. </p><p> I saw my companion rise up before me.</p><p> “The hour is come!” he said. “We must die. We</p><p>are rejected of men. They despise us. We will </p><p>not endure it Let us crush them!” </p><p> “Mercy!” I cried.</p><p> “Let us cut these cords! Let this car be abandon-</p><p>ed in space. The attractive force will change its </p><p>direction, and we shall approach the sun!” </p><p> Despair galvanized me. I threw myself upon the</p><p>madman, we struggled together, and a terrible con- </p><p>flict took place. But I was thrown down, and while </p><p>he held me under his knee, the madman was cutting </p><p>the cords of the car. “One!” he cried. </p><p> “My God!”</p><p> “Two! Three!”</p><p> I made a superhuman effort, rose up, and vio-</p><p>lently repulsed the madman,</p><p>A DRAMA IN THE AIK </p><p>765 </p><p> “Four!" The car fell, but I instinctively clung</p><p>to the cords and hoisted myself into the meshes </p><p>of the netting. </p><p> The madman disappeared in space!</p><p> The balloon rose to an immeasurable height.</p><p>A horrible cracking was heard. The gas, too much </p><p>dilated, had burst the balloon. I shut my eyes- </p><p> Some instants after, a damp warmth revived</p><p>me. I was in the midst of clouds on fire. The </p><p>balloon turned over with dizzy velocity. Taken by </p><p>the wind, it made a hundred leagues an hour in a </p><p>horizontal course, the lightning flashing around it. </p><p> Meanwhile my fall was not a very rapid one.</p><p>When I opened my eyes, I saw the country. I was </p><p>two miles from the sea, and the tempest was driv- </p><p>ing me violently towards it, when an abrupt shock </p><p>forced me to loosen my hold. My hands opened, a </p><p>The </p><p>cord slipped swiftly between my fingers, and I </p><p>found myself on the solid earth! </p><p> It was the cord of the anchor, which, sweeping</p><p>along the surface of the ground, was caught in a </p><p>crevice; and my balloon, unballasted for the last </p><p>time, careered off to lose itself beyond the sea. </p><p> When I came to myself, I was in bed in a peas-</p><p>ant’s cottage, at Harderwijk, a village of Gelder- </p><p>land, fifteen leagues from Amsterdam, on the shores </p><p>of the Zuyder-Zee. </p><p> A miracle had saved my life, but my voyage had</p><p>been a series of imprudences, committed by a </p><p>lunatic, and I had not been able to prevent them. </p><p> May this terrible narrative, though instructing</p><p>those who read it, not discourage the explorers of </p><p>the air* </p><p>End </p><p> Stars</p><p> OUT through space my spirit leaps,</p><p> Swifter far than light;</p><p> Up to the lunar craters,</p><p> Gilded, banked with night;</p><p> Over the channeled, ruddy Mars,</p><p> Up through Saturn’s rings;</p><p> Parting the hair of comets,</p><p> On my spirit wings;</p><p> Out where vast and awful voids</p><p> Space the Milky Way—</p><p> Room for earths by hundreds</p><p> To spin the night and day;</p><p> Straight through stuff of orbs unborn,</p><p> Mammoth nebula*;</p><p> Lost where stars by thousands</p><p> Light the Ether Sea;</p><p> Far in timeless, bournless space</p><p> Till systems cease to roll;</p><p> Ever vainly seeking</p><p> Hope and the Supersoul.</p><p> Millions die who never knew</p><p> Half I see and ken</p><p> While I circle madly</p><p> Through the stars.

But, in</p><p> fact, many of those to whom the invi-</p><p> tations had gone did not even take the</p><p> trouble to thank their would-be savior.</p><p> A few, however, who did not come in</p><p> person, sent responses. Among these</p><p> was the President of the United</p><p> States. Mr. Samson’s letter was brief</p><p> but characteristic. It read:</p><p> To Cosmo Versal, Esq.</p><p> iSir:</p><p> The President directs me to</p><p> say that he is grateful for your</p><p> invitation, and regrets that he</p><p> cannot accept it. He is informed</p><p> by those to whose official advice</p><p> he feels bound to listen, that the</p><p> recent extraordinary events pos-</p><p> sess no such significance as you</p><p> attach to them,</p><p>Respectfully, </p><p> James Jenks, Secretary.</p><p> It must be remembered that this</p><p> letter was written before the oceanic</p><p> overflow began. After that, possibly,</p><p> the President and his advisers changed</p><p> their opinion. But then communica-</p><p> tion by rail was cut off, and as soon</p><p> as the downpour from the sky com-</p><p> menced the aero express lines were</p><p> abandoned. The air-ships would have</p><p> been deluged, and blown to destruc-</p><p> tion by the tremendous gusts which,</p><p> at intervals, packed the rain-choked</p><p> air itself into solid billows of water.</p><p> None of the rulers of the old world</p><p> responded, but about half the men of</p><p> science, and representatives of the</p><p> other classes that Cosmo had set down;</p><p>“Real Money in </p><p>the Bank” </p><p> “Think of it, Nell—$4601 And to thinK</p><p> that just a few months ago we couldn’t save</p><p> a ccnt.</p><p> “Remember the night we talked it over</p><p> and you persuaded me to send in that I.

The clatter of their vari-</p><p> ous tongues made a very Babel inside</p><p> the ark, when they talked to one an^</p><p> other in groups, but nearly all of them</p><p> were able to speak English, which,</p><p> after many years of experiment, has</p><p> been adopted as the common language</p><p> for transacting the world’s affairs.</p><p> There was another letter, which</p><p> Cosmo read with real regret, although</p><p> hardly with surprise. It was from</p><p> Professor Pludder. Instead of ex-</p><p> pressing gratitude for the invitation,</p><p> as the President, trained in political</p><p> blandiloquence, had done, Professor</p><p> Pludder indulged in denunciation.</p><p> “You are insane,” he said. “You</p><p> do not know what you are talking</p><p> about. Your letter is an insult to</p><p> science. These inundations” (this,</p><p> too, was written before the sky had</p><p> opened its flood-gates) “are perfectly</p><p> explicable by the ordinary laws of</p><p> nature. Your talk of a nebula is so</p><p> ridiculous that it deserves no reply.</p><p> If any lunatic accepts your absurd in-</p><p> vitation, and goes into your ‘ark,’ he</p><p> will find himself in Bedlam, where he</p><p> ought to be.”</p><p> “I guess you were right,” Cosmo</p><p> remarked to Joseph Smith, after read-</p><p> ing this outburst. Pludder would not</p><p> contribute to the regeneration of man-</p><p> kind. We are better off without him.”</p><p> But Cosmo Versal was mistaken in</p><p> thinking he had heard the last of Abiel</p><p> Pludder. The latter was destined to</p><p> show that he was hardly a less re-</p><p> markable specimen of homo sapiens</p><p> than the big-headed prophet of the</p><p> second deluge himself.</p><p> As soon as it became evident that’</p><p> there would be room to spare in the</p><p> ark, Cosmo set at work to fill up the</p><p> list. He went over his categories once</p><p> more, but now, owing to the pressure</p><p> of time, he was obliged to confine his</p><p> selections to persons within easy</p><p> reach. They came, nearly all, from</p><p> New York, or its vicinity; and since</p><p> these last invitations went out just</p><p> on the eve of the events described in</p><p> the last two chapters, there was no</p><p> delay in the acceptances, and the in-</p><p> vitees promptly presented themselves</p><p> in person.</p><p>AGENTS WANTED </p><p> Free Book.
