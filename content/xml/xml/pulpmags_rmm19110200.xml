In the good old days you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could tell a railroad man by the cut of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">jib as far as you could see him. The con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ductor didn't have to look at the applicant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for the courtesies of the road.

Had the freight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trains been equipped with brakes of sufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, thought Mr. Westinghouse, the collision</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have been avoided, and immediately he set</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work to develop such a brake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An inventor, named Ambler, already had .per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fected a chain-brake which was operated by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolving of a windlass in the engine, the chain</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus being taken up and the brake-levers of each</seg><seg type="columnLine">car thus operated. To Mr. Westinghouse came</seg><seg type="columnLine">die idea of exchanging the windlass for a cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the locomotive, the piston of which should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be of extraordinary length and connected with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Ambler's chain, so that the drawing in of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">piston by the application of steam from the loco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">motive would give a more accurate control of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brakes than was possible with the windlass device.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But experiments showed quickly that the piston</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be made long enough to operate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chain on more than four or five cars, and Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Westinghouse overcame this difficulty by placing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cylinder beneath each car with a flexible pipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">connecting each one to the locomotive for its</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply of steam. The effort failed because it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">found impossible to transmit the steam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was then that Mr Westinghouse saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">article on compressed air, and in the use of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">medium instantly saw a solution to his difficulties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An apparatus employing compressed air instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steam was built at once, and a Steubenville,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ohio, accommodation-train of the Panhandle Rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road was equipped with the device. On its first</seg><seg type="columnLine">test the engineer, as his train emerged from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel near the Union Station.in Pittsburgh, saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wagon on the tracks, and the value of the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">brake was demonstrated instantly by the short</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance in which the train was halted in time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid an accident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many experiments were made by various rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads, and, in 1869, several of these had their</seg><seg type="columnLine">running stock equipped with the new brake: but</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more the inventor was to face and overcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">an obstacle. It developed that it look too long</seg><seg type="columnLine">to set and release the brakes, and that in the event</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a break in the train, the rear section would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">without brakes.

I sighed as I real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized that for the next week I should prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably have to submit to being dragged about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to visit places in which I had no possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest, and to listen to Wesley's enthusi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">astic apostrophes on them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, as I went to pack the bags--this task</seg><seg type="columnLine">always devolved upon me, as Wesley was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite likely to put his shoes upon the bosom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his dress-shirt, and our Chinese servant</seg><seg type="columnLine">still adhered to Oriental ideas regarding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">component parts of a gentleman's wardrobe</seg><seg type="columnLine">--I was not the most happy person in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wesley, however, was as cheerful as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever seen him, and kept running in to</seg><seg type="columnLine">regale me with puerile anecdotes of the good</seg><seg type="columnLine">old days on the farm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went to bed in a fit of the sulks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was not improved by having to rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">at break of dawn to catch the train for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Youngbridge, in order to make connections</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the way-train that ran over the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">branch road through Youngville.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  During the half-mile drive from the sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to the Youngville House, a pilgrimage</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplished in a dilapidated surrey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn by a decrepit rackabones, I was in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">perpetual state of terror lest the bottom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our conveyance should drop out and deposit</seg><seg type="columnLine">us and our belongings in the dusty road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We arrived without mishap, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">about two o'clock in the afternoon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were shown to rooms on the second floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hotel. I say "hotel." because that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is what every one called it, although it</seg><seg type="columnLine">more nearlv resembled a converted barn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">than anything else I could bring to mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am firmly convihced that the proprietor</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran the place for his health; it certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not have been for that of his guests.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was anything but a philanthropist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, the weather was fine, and we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">spend most of our time out of doors, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was some consolation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had luncheon in the dining-room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is, I did. Wesley was so anxious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get out and see the town that he couldn't eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and didn't want me to. He grudged me</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything I put into my mouth, watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">my busy knife and fork until I politely</seg><seg type="columnLine">requested him to otherwise occupy himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when, with an injured air, he fell to drum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming on the table with a vinegar cruet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as I had finished, which I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">as quickly as possible, he arose with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sigh of relief, and announced his intention</seg><seg type="columnLine">of proceeding at once to "the old place."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Accordingly, we sallied forth, Wesley keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up a running fire of comment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the main street, Dick; they've</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it macadamized since I was here," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">informed me.

And see those big stores</seg><seg type="columnLine">--my! how the place has grown!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We turned down a side street, bordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rather cheap - looking frame houses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wesley looked them over disapprovingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I don't like those," he said. " When</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was a boy, this was Woods Lane, all bor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered with grand old oaks and elms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They've cut down all the trees and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">it look like property in a land-improvement</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme. It's an infernal shame! The men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who destroyed those trees ought to be tarred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feathered! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rest of the afternoon was simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">piling Pel ion upon Ossa, Wesley's com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments becoming more and more caustic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The climax was reached when he discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered that the old farm had been cut up</seg><seg type="columnLine">into miserable little thirty-foot lots, upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which more of the squat, frame cottages</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been erected; and that the site of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">" ole swiminin'-hole " was occupied by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large and odoriferous tannery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We committed the indiscretion of getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to windward of this, and beat a hasty re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treat. I was obliged to confess that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse than Wesley's pipe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we walked back toward the hotel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking another route, Wesley was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet; but now and then he burst into</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigorous denunciations of the vandals who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had changed a beautiful country village</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN WESLEY CAME BACK.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">63</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">into a small and mean imitation of a city</seg><seg type="columnLine">suburb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could understand exactly how he felt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having experienced something of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling when I visited my birthplace in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York city, and found that the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been converted into a populous</seg><seg type="columnLine">" double-decker " tenement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only the Billings farm remained of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the well-remembered places that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear to him. The Menness place had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been altered either, he said. Indeed, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed little doubt of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was inclined to believe it an offshoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the original ark. The house appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be in a state of innocuous desuetude,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there were alarming indications that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole thing was likely to fall apart at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the little white farmhouse of ]o-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siah Billings, set in the midst of its em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erald meadows and woods, looked quiet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">restful, that one harmonious note in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">discordant whole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was getting toward sundown, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows were lengthening on the grass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wesley's face wore a tired and disappoint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed look, as we stood at the gate and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the white palings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are just two people I want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, Dick," he said presently.

I believe that's he!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He flung open the gate, and hurried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet a white-haired old man, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming down the path toward us.

He turned and led</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way up to the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Come back to see the old place, have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, eh?" he said, when we had settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves comfortably, and Wesley had in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired after Timmy and various other one-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time intimates. "Well, it ain't what it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">used to be, I can tell you that." He shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head sadly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know when I've had such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock," Wesley said seriously. " I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back here, as you say, to see the old place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to renew old associations and old friend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships. And I find a miserable second-rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">town; all the associations dead and buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">or outraged--and you and Dr. Kellogg the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only friends left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going back to-morrow.

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But there won't be much longer, son."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The old man's voice was very low.

"We had a bad season</seg><seg type="columnLine">about three year ago, and I had to put a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mortgage on the place. Squire Daudel took</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.

In a field not far from the mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gulley he saw a cabin. Two minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">later he knocked at its door.

Confident</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was nobody inside, he tried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It opened, and he peered in. The place</seg><seg type="columnLine">was musty for lack of air. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">some straw on the floor that was clean and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been used for a bed. On one side was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small wooden shelf, over which a piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of broken mirror was held to the wall by</seg><seg type="columnLine">nails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seth went to the mirror and looked at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">visage. Egad, but he needed tonsorial at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention! His beard was getting long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unkempt--and his hair was none too slick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Otherwise, he thought, he looked pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tired from the long ride and the expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riences of the past few days, he stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself on the straw and fell asleep. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he awoke, the peculiar grayness of the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">that simmered through the little window</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him that it was morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He arose and went out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " My kingdom for a horse!

" These old hills are full of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">failures."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He drank, and bathed his face in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring. Then he made for the road again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started to tramp. He had walked about</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hours, when he spied a dozen or so</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses grazing on a hillside about half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Convincing himself that there were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">herdsmen in sight, he stole along the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derbrush until he came within close range</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the animals. One or two sniffed the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw their heads up, and snorted. Seth</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a long detour around a clump of</seg><seg type="columnLine">small oaks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eye was on a small bay bronco gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zing apart from the herd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " That's my kind," he declared. " Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">little fellows make the best travelers.

It was evident that he was the easiest</seg><seg type="columnLine">to catch and was used to round up the rest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At least, that was the reason which Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Waters gave. And he was right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found that the bronco stood perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">still as he approached. Catching the halter</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope, he forced it into the animal's mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and manipulated it deftly and quickly, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the manner known to cow-men when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to use a rope for a bit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bronco started on his familiar prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tise of rounding up the other horses when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seth Waters hopped on his back. He sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly realized that there was something out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ordinary when his rider steered him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direction of the road, thrust a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp heels in its unwilling flanks, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed him in an opposite direction from</seg><seg type="columnLine">home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Horse-stealing was punishable by death</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--	quick and unrelenting -- in those days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it needed no court of justice to prove the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guilt of the thief. He was generally taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his boots on and the stolen property</seg><seg type="columnLine">under him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seth knew that he was safe so long as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road before him was clear, and nothing like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of a rifle-shot echoed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills behind. He traveled along until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bronco was short of wind and the foam was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to fleck his coat. Then Seth</seg><seg type="columnLine">steered his mount to one side, where a clump</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trees afforded shelter and indicated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence of water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Late that afternoon, while the bronco was</seg><seg type="columnLine">grazing as peacefully and contentedly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his limited halter would permit, and his new</seg><seg type="columnLine">owner was contemplating the all-important</seg><seg type="columnLine">issue of food, both were surprised by a sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den rustling in the bushes near by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The animal was first to give an alarm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rising on his haunches, he snorted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reared until Seth feared that he would sever</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rope and run.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seth grabbed his mane with one hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the halter with the other. He did not want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lose that bronco.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whatever had caused the animal to rear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing was certain--it was not a man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No horse ever started in that manner be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of a man. Seth knew that some other</seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE HORNET'S NEST.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">animal was lurking around. He surmised,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, that it was a wild animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bronco gave another rear and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snort, and began to tremble from head to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail. Seth patted him gently and spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">soothingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then' he looked in the brush ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As if ready to spring, a huge panther</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched before him. He looked as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad been long without the sumptuous meal</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Seth would make.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, Mr. Waters was not a man to quail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When one has been through so much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he in the .years of his Western life, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing face to face with a panther is only an</seg><seg type="columnLine">episode.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some moments he stood by the horse's</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, patting his neck and flank and speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the most reassuring tone. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmed the bronco, who evidently knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the man had no fear, there was no dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger. Such is the remarkable instinct of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Let us see," said Seth as he looked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild beast over. " You belong to the feline</seg><seg type="columnLine">carnivore family, and are a sort of a leopard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You don't like human beings much, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">will devour them if your hunger is wrought</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the starving-point. You never leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Africa, the naturalists say, but I will bet</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you are the real thing. I know some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about animals--believe me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before he was aware, the panther made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden spring at him. In a flash, he threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm over the bronco's eyes to hide the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight from that animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a desperate thing to do, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only thing under the circumstances. If the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bronco broke and ran away, he would be at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the panther's mercy. If he mounted, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened horse might refuse to budge, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be just as precariously situated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What was he to do?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he made the sudden step toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bronco to cover its eyes, the panther grazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by him. He felt the thudding impact of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">body against his arm. Having failed in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">design---whatever that might lie--Seth rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soned that it would make a second attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was not wrong. It came at him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind. This time he looked fairly into its</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaping jaws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The beast tore a piece from the bronco's</seg><seg type="columnLine">left haunch. Then he took up a position</seg><seg type="columnLine">not ten feet away and began to devour his</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bronco whinnied and reared, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">then calmed down. Seth stepped to one side</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pick up a rock to hurl at the panther.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He noticed that when he moved, the pan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther moved toward him and showed its</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth with a threatening growl. If Seth re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained perfectly quiet, the panther seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have no objection to his company. Twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thrice he repeated the experiment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepping toward the rock, but each time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">panther showed his disapproval. Truly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a prisoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It is best to take the situation calmly,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he surmised. " I will just wait and see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Panther is going to do.

The bronco</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have known that his time had come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he made one mighty lunge, broke his</seg><seg type="columnLine">halter, and started to run.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The panther was too quick. In a flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was at the bronco's throat. The latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">started at a wild gallop, with his adversary-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging to his jugular. He dashed up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small incline, at the top of which a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">oak was growing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hurled himself against the oak in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort to either dislodge or kill the panther,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the marauder only clung the tighter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His teeth were fastened in the grip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death.

That blood-loving animal would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">never -released his grip had it been other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise. He took a sitting posture in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead horse. There was food enough for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I guess this is no place for me," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seth as he looked around him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was on the side of the little hill--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">incline, as I have described it--and in full</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of the panther. He feared that if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should deliberately arise and walk away, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">panther might spring at him. He had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">encounters with wild beasts before in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, and he knew that such flesh-eaters gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erally take no chances. Their instinct is</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty keen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seth, calling into play the old motto,</seg><seg type="columnLine">" Caution is wisdom," dragged his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the ground until he was at the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the little hill.

" These felines generally prefer hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mans to animals. He must have liked me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said to himself as he gradually slid along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground and vanished into a clump of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild oats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There he stopped and listened. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no sound. He made farther progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the tall oats. He crouched along until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came to a small clump of trees. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">he skirted, and was soon again on the dusty</seg><seg type="columnLine">pike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked for miles, until his feet, sore</seg><seg type="columnLine">and aching, indicated that he could go no</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther. Soon the road led into a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">canon where there was water. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathe his tired feet, and drink his fill, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest for the night. In the morning he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramp on and on again until something came</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seth was not the sort of man who denied</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate the privilege of being good to him.

It was the home of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seth was soon at the man's back door. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry dog at the end of a big chain an-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced his presence. The farmer evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the dog's keen discernment of men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramps, and appeared with a shotgun. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon was slung over his left arm, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand was in close proximity to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trigger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I'm unarmed," said Seth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Evidently that made no difference to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmer.

He did not ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear until after " reveille " in the morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was not drunk when he came into camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the morning, for he had slept off the ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fects to some extent on the prairie between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the town and camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men were at breakfast when Brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">was seen to enter camp. He was at once put</seg><seg type="columnLine">under guard and Lieutenant Hill, of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">company, sent word to the sergeant of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard that Brown was to be compelled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">march all that day and carry his full outfit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This meant that he was to wear his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knapsack with all that goes with it, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanket, one overcoat, a change of clothes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun, and his full allowance of cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridges.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was something very unusual for any</seg><seg type="columnLine">man under guard to carry a gun and am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munition; to be armed, in fact. I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it to be done but that once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brown was a sick man. The morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very warm and it gave promise of be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a torrid day. The prospect before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown was a bad one. He asked permission</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak to Lieutenant Hill, and the ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geant took him, with a guard, to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer. Brown said to the lieutenant:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I am very sick and not able to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">the punishment to-day. I can scarcely hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hill said: " If you had remained in camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">last night and had not drunk so much bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisky you would not be sick to-day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whose fault is it. yours or mine?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well," said Brown, " if you will let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">off to-day you may give any punishment</seg><seg type="columnLine">you like to-morrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Oh," said the lieutenant, "you give me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that privilege, do you? Well, you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk to-day just as I have ordered; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't give me one more word of back talk!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Take him back, sentry, and tell the sergeant</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to send him to me again! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Brown tried to speak again, but the lieu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenant lost his temper and said: "If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter another word, I will tie you to the tail</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a mule and let him drag you or kick you</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he likes! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The guard hurried Brown to the rear, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took his place in the center of the guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take up his awful punishment. I say</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful punishment, for the man was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick, no matter what the cause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The column started. Brown blundered</seg><seg type="columnLine">along for about an hour and again begged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be brought before the lieutenant, which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, the sergeant dared not do without</seg><seg type="columnLine">permission.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brown then asked to see the commanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer. If an enlisted man wishes to speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an officer, he must first obtain the per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission of his sergeant. The commanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer refused to interfere. Brown kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">begging to be allowed to again speak to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Hill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sergeant of the guard, seeing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his prisoner was in a bad way, went himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Lieutenant Hill and got the necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">permission for Brown. The entire com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand was halted for a short rest, and Brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">was brought forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hill said: "Well, what is it now?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Didn't I tell you not to come to me again? "</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown replied: v" ' Lieutenant,' it is im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible for me to march any farther. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am not able to stand it. I would rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">die."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Hill said: " You will stand it, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">must stand it! When you think you can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand up, why, fall down, and I will find a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to drag you along." Hill said this not</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an officer, but in a sneering, tantalizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">way and with a devilish smile on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brown was swaying and about to fall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His case was no longer one of punishment</seg><seg type="columnLine">between officer and private. It had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of torture, to gratify the officer's curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">osity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  All this time, the lieutenant was pulling</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chin whisker with his gloved hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smilingly goading his helpless prisoner into</seg><seg type="columnLine">an insane frenzy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE BOTTLE OF "WATER."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">113</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brown lowered his head a moment, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up and said in a low, tense voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I cannot walk any longer to-day; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I won't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before any one could stop him, he drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped his musket into the hollow of his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm and fired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lieutenant fell dead. He did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter even one groan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly Brown inslipped a fresh car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tridge, but Major Whitehead grappled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and, with the help of Captain Gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">braith, wrenched the gun from the des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate man. Brown was too weak to offer</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than momentary resistance and ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling. No one had much to say--we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were stunned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The major threw the cartridge from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown's gun. " Why did you load this ? "</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked.	■&gt;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To kill you with," exclaimed Brown;</seg><seg type="columnLine">" and I had another for that big man beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">you "--meaning Captain Galbraith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crazed man was taken to the rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his arms tied behind his back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After putting the dead lieutenant's body</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an ambulance, the command started</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Opinion among the men was di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided. Some condemned the act as brutal</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder; others said Brown did right, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Hill went too far and drove him mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brown seemed to glory in what he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">clone. He said that Hill intended he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk all day, and if he dropped down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he knew he must do, the officer would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have had him dragged to death. He seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">very anxious to hear what the men in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranks thought of the killing, and asked every</seg><seg type="columnLine">one he could get near enough if they blamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strange as it may seem, there were many</seg><seg type="columnLine">men* who thought Brown had done right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, though not daring to be outspoken, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence he had their sympathy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brown was the corps' shoemaker, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not considered a bad man. He would drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than was good for him at times, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">so would the officers. As a general thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown did his duty faithfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first sergeant of Brown's company,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick Guggall, was now busily going from</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to man holding a whispering conversa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with each. The officers up ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the column kept looking back toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place where Brown was plodding along,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound in the midst or-his guards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It seemed as if the officers were expecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to happen. It was becoming</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">evident that there was trouble of some kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">brewing. Men would dart from place to</seg><seg type="columnLine">place and speak in a low tone to others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of them seemed to object to what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. It could be seen that there were dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent opinions about something.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One man made such a determined stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">in favor of his way of thinking that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came near being shots exchanged between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two men, but this argument was silenced</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the first sergeant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Of course, we--I mean our little squad of '</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten men--being outsiders and interested only</seg><seg type="columnLine">as onlookers, took no part in this mystery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but could, from our elevated positions, see</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the hasty movements and earnest con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation of the few men that were endeavor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to gain converts to their way,of thinking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I had not even a suspicion of what was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind until I heard Brown say: "Oh!</seg><seg type="columnLine">My God! Why don't they come if they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming and put me out of my misery! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't go any farther."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then it dawned on me what all the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion was about. But still I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that among United States soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">many men could be found to deliberately</seg><seg type="columnLine">take part in another tragedy like the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">just acted by one reckless, suffering, half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">demented man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brown kept moaning, "if you fellows</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't hurry, it will be too late! Tell them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hurry up." Again he would say, " I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">never live to see the sun go down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke the truth. Within an hour from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time he shot Lieutenant Hill, about</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty men of his own company suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out of the ranks on either side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marching column.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It could be seen that they were obeying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the signal of a leader, for at a slap made</seg><seg type="columnLine">by striking the butt of a musket with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand' they all started at a "double quick"</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the rear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twenty yards from the rear-guard they</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted, and told the guards to step aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you want? What do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean?" angrily demanded the sergeant of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We want Brown. Get away from him</seg><seg type="columnLine">or you'll get hurt," yelled one of th? men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the rest seconded him. Not an officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked back; they began to ride farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not much you don't! There will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than one dead man around here if</seg><seg type="columnLine">any one tries that!

The guard kept muttering among</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves, and again it could be seen that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown had his friends who did not regard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shooting with so much horror as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, there seemed to be some magic</seg><seg type="columnLine">word which, when spoken, put an end to</seg><seg type="columnLine">further argument. It was evident, too, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown had no hope, and was eager to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all over, as he was suffering tortures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">both of mind and body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The guards reluctantly scattered to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front and rear, leaving Brown exposed. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of the way his hands were tied behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back, his body was bent forward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head was hanging, but, as soon as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard left him, he made an effort and raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">his blood-shot eyes to the small mob of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he had lived among for nearly three</seg><seg type="columnLine">years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had come to kill him. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">them all. He kept his eyes on them steadily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only allowing them to flit from one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">another until he had looked each of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">executioners in the face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said only a few words. They were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">" take a good aim, boys," and " this is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor way to pay debts," for most of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">owed him money for cobbling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the guard stepped forward, he fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and the firing-party took deliberate</seg><seg type="columnLine">aim. Some went down on one knee so as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be more steady. Then they fired. Brown's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was riddled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The squad hastily took their places in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ranks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was significant that the officers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">too far ahead of the marching column to</seg><seg type="columnLine">interfere in the killing of Brown. After the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting, they rode back and gave a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried orders. Then the command ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced a quarter of a mile and halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the burial-party was putting Brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a grave. The soil was quickly shovel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">led over him, and the march was taken up</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About noon, the ambulance containing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead lieutenant was started ahead under</seg><seg type="columnLine">escort, for the first place on the line of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad where steps could be taken to pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve the body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The affair made a deep impression on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men, and, no doubt, on the officers, also.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was dangerous to say much about it, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">both men had their champions. The lieu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenant was condemned by many for his cruel</seg><seg type="columnLine">treatment of Brown, yet there were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">many to speak a good word for Brown's</seg><seg type="columnLine">act.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was said that the lieutenant did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe Brown's statement that he was .so</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick, but this could have been all settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">very easily by allowing Brown to consult the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor. This the lieutenant had flatly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused to do. Though it was dangerous to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say anything in Brown's defense, yet he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had his friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night after "taps" six of his-com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rades secretly left the camp with picks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shovels, and a blanket, returned to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tragedy took place, and dug up Brown's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. While two were sewing it in a blan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ket, the others dug a deep grave to protect</seg><seg type="columnLine">it from the wolves. The burial-party then</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered the body, and, perhaps, a silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayer was said. There he lies to-day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The six quietly returned to camp. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a tramp of eighteen miles to make be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween " taps " and daylight, besides running</seg><seg type="columnLine">the risk of being found out, which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have incurred the ill-will of the officers--if</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing worse. Their act would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">construed as showing sympathy for Brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">as against Lieutenant Hill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the affair did not end. It caused a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitter feeling between the men in the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany, and, for a long time, it was the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">direct cause of many bloody quarrels, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused the killing of three of the men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot Brown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The best opinions seemed to be that both</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lieutenant and Brown received what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they deserved, but that, for the good of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">service. Brown should have been shot by</seg><seg type="columnLine">court martial instead of being murdered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mob instigated by the officers. Then there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been no evil aftermath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Only one good seemed to come from it all;</seg><seg type="columnLine">discipline became more strict, making cases</seg><seg type="columnLine">for punishment fewer and the penalties more</seg><seg type="columnLine">humane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Five deaths and a fued among a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had flowed from one bottle of hell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, that a saloon-keeper might make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ten Thousand Miles by Rail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BY GILSON WILLETS,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Special Traveling Correspondent of "The Railroad Man's Magazine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">No. 9.--SOME HOLD-UPS IN MISSOURI.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Hat with the Star, and the Part It Played in a Famous Attack by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bandits; Also, What a Large Reward Drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some Men To Do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ISS NELLIE SEACH, eight- She pointed to a wide-brimmed som-</seg><seg type="columnLine">een and very pretty, was brero.

Jerry was then put between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shafts of a single wagon and he made his</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliveries alone, for he would not work double</seg><seg type="columnLine">with any other horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry became the pet of the office force, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">favorite of the merchants and the stablemen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his intelligence and gentleness.

Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time ago, one of the horses in the bain became</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill. Jerry was put in a single stall that the sick</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal might have the box.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now this was not to Jerry's liking.

The driver soon caught on and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">became fast friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry has a record as a watchman that is hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">to equal. Several years ago there was what ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to be a hold-up in the yard at the rear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office.

An old minister, Mr. Moreland, who has come from Tillman's father, is assaulted, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Raymond tries to lay the crime at Tillman's door but is, himself, accused by Moreland.

The train was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalled at the foot of the Homestake Moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain, the extra weight of its passengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">proving too much, so the engineer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to back into the yards again. Or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders were then issued from the superin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendent's office that no more trains would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be moved while the army lay in waiting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It might be added here that the authori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties at Washington were also getting anx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ious, as the movement each day became</seg><seg type="columnLine">more formidable.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">done, a fire was started in one'of the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines, and the men hastened to load their</seg><seg type="columnLine">traps, blankets and provisions, of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had plenty, into some empty coal-cars</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing on the siding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything was soon ready, the engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">was run out, coupled onto the coal-cars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and noiselessly the Coxeyites took their</seg><seg type="columnLine">places about the train.

In this he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was disappointed, however, for as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engineer discovered the obstruction he</seg><seg type="columnLine">Realized that an effort was being made to</seg><seg type="columnLine">capture them.	f</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pulled her wide open and dashed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">full speed into the pile of dirt, sending rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gravel flying through the air.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">consultation was held, and it was decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run her to Livingston if possible, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a division terminal, where they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure another engine.

The first freight rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">was charged by the stage-coach, say be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween New York City and Albany, New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York. This rate by stage-coach or freight</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon was as low as could be charged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet bring the freighter a profit. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">the charge was too high the goods did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">move, or else some one hitched up his team</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started a rival freight line. By wagon</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was a very easy thing to do, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">public road was free to all, which a line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rails, of course, is not. All trains must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be run under a single management, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, will be accidents, Which does not</seg><seg type="columnLine">apply to wagons and the public road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Schooners Versus Stage-Coaches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before there was a railroad in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States there were certain well-de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fined charges for hauling various kinds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">freight between a number of points, such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as New York City and Albany, as just</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned, or between New York and Bos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton. The freight rate between New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Boston, of course, could not be much</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher than that charged by a ship be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween New York and Boston, otherwise the</seg><seg type="columnLine">goods would move by ship rather than by</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon. Thus, even before there was a rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road in existence, we find that bugbear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all freight men, "water competition."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Hudson River, as every one knows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flows past Albany to New York City, but is</seg><seg type="columnLine">frozen during the winter so that no boats</seg><seg type="columnLine">can run. In summer, freight was moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the two cities by water if there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was plenty of time, but by stage if time</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an essential element in the case, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the mails or some light article, say</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rifle, where the extra expense of delivery</seg><seg type="columnLine">by fast wagon service was little, compared</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its cost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, in summer, the stage line and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">freighter with his oxen hauled only ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terial of high value that needed great care</seg><seg type="columnLine">or quick delivery, but in winter the case</seg><seg type="columnLine">was different. Then, the Hudson being</seg><seg type="columnLine">frozen, the stage line and the wagons had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hauling all to themselves, and hence</seg><seg type="columnLine">could charge more. Also, the cost of serv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice in winter was naturally higher, due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snow, bad roads, and other causes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here we find trouble in figuring freight</seg><seg type="columnLine">rates even before the railroad was invented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Rates, in those days, changed with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather, for one rate the year round would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been impossible under such condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From Albany to Boston there is no water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, hence the wagon-owners could charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">a higher rate than they could from New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York to Albany.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Although the distances between- the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities, New York, Boston, and Albany, vary</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerably, for our purposes we can con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sider them practically equally distant apart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet with vastly different conditions applying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to each route. The sea from Boston to New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York is always open, hence the freight rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be expected to remain more or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady the year around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From New York to Albany, as we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">just seen, is a river, open half of the year</seg><seg type="columnLine">or more, while from Albany to Boston, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third leg of the triangle, there is no water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, hence the rate would be more or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher than that of the other two routes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more or less steady, but not so steady as by</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea between New York and Boston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A Problem Older Than Railroads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have chosen these three cities because</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them they well illustrate many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the things that so profoundly affect_the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">king of freight rates, whether by wagon or</seg><seg type="columnLine">freight-car, it matters not. There are, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, still other differences to be considered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">every one of which cuts a deep figure in</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a freight rate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Right here let me call attention to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that, at that time, the railroad was yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing undreamed of. He who fancies that</seg><seg type="columnLine">freight rates are all a matter of the railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows nothing of freight rates. Rome,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Italy, had her rate troubles just like Rome,</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York; one when Mr. C^sar attended</seg><seg type="columnLine">to such affairs and the other when Mr. Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riman did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But to get back to still other matters than</seg><seg type="columnLine">rivers, the weather, ships, and wagons that</seg><seg type="columnLine">affect freight rates: New York is larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Albany, and is a seaport, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller town is inland. New York's trade</seg><seg type="columnLine">is more or less constant, while that of Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bany varies greatly. In fact, it is a well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed fact that the larger the city the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more steady is its trade in all lines, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluding the moving of freight. In the fall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Albany had much wheat to send to New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York, while in the summer months but little</seg><seg type="columnLine">freight went down the valley on wheels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">144</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, this meant empty wagons at vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous times of the year between New York and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Albany. Empty wagons cost money to move</seg><seg type="columnLine">as horses eat oats and drivers must be paid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether the wagon is loaded or empty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In railroad language, this is called the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"empty car haul," and is one of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">things that worries a railroad president.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before we grasp this matter completely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we must glance at still another fundamental</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact in freight-rate making. It is hard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make this clear in a few words, and an il-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lustration will best serve our purpose. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact is this: The shipper must pay the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost of the round trip, even though he uses</seg><seg type="columnLine">the service only one way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suppose a man lives in Albany and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wishes to go to New York. There is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage leaving that particular day or for sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral days, as was once the case. He goes</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the local livery stable and asks: "How</seg><seg type="columnLine">much will you charge to take me to New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Cost of Going Back Empty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The liveryman says: " Let's see. I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the trip down and back in ten days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the roads and weather are good. I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">use two horses, each worth $1 a day, a driver</seg><seg type="columnLine">at $1 a day, making $3 a day for man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">team. The cost of staying over night will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be another $3. Profit $1 a day, or a total</seg><seg type="columnLine">of $7 a day for ten days. Call it $75 for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trip."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " But suppose you get a passenger to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry back? Can't you make the price less</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me if that happens?" asks the pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pective traveler.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Certainly," replies the liveryman. " I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you what I'll do. I'll charge you $75 if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can't get a passenger back; but if I can.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll ask only $50."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " But then you will be making $100,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">protests the traveler. " You should charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">me only $37.50 and the other man $37.50,</seg><seg type="columnLine">both alike."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the coach charges only $30 from</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York to Albany," the livery man says,</seg><seg type="columnLine">" and I must charge much less, say $25, or I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't get a passenger back at all, in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">case the trip will cost you $75, instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">only $50."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the traveler pays his $75 for a trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Albany to New York, and if the livery-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man can get a passenger back to Albany,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the traveler gets a rebate of $25, thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">making the trip cost him only $50. Doubt-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">less all the way to New York the two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">argued a regular prehistoric Interstate Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merce Commission trial, and when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted in New York both probably were</seg><seg type="columnLine">more or less muddled about it all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> •This is the very thing that confronted J.</seg><seg type="columnLine">J.

By this means, the Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northern could charge less for west-bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">freight, even if that charge was several times</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher than the east-bound forty-cent rate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here we are up against the "joint-cost"</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea again, only in a new light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So we have seen a glimpse of " volume of</seg><seg type="columnLine">traffic," of "water competition," and of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">" empty car haul," each a very important</seg><seg type="columnLine">item in the making of freight rates. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">let us invent the steam-engine, and with it</seg><seg type="columnLine">the railroad, and see what happens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first railroad from New York to Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bany found freight rates already estab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lished. To get business it had to charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same or a lower rate than those of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isting transportation companies, as, other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise, goods would not move by rail, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">would travel by wagon or boat. Now, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a very important fact; and please note</seg><seg type="columnLine">it carefully: A rate in existence fixes all</seg><seg type="columnLine">other rates between the same points. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">other words, one rate is based on another</seg><seg type="columnLine">that came before it. Whether this rate is</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed by wagon, ship, canal-boat, pack train,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or another railroad matters not in the least,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if for the' same service the goods will move</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a cheaper route.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">What Vanderbilt Found.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, in the early days a railroad'did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">push on into new country as it usually does</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-day. They followed the old toll-road</seg><seg type="columnLine">system to some extent. That is, a railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">would run from New York to Albany, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">another from Albany to Utica, and still an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other from Utica to Buffalo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each road had its own cars, stations, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">time-tables, regardless of all roads, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was neither pleasant nor profitable. To load</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unload wheat several times, and cart it</seg><seg type="columnLine">across town from one railroad to another</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost money; hence, wheat from Buffalo to</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York came by the Erie Canal. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad was then about what the various</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric lines are to-day, more or less local</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unconnected affairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But. one night, a man named Vanderbilt</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE A.

Then and there was born the New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York Central, and in time this dream be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came true.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Vanderbilt finally had his railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">running from Buffalo to New York, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the same conditions by water as be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween Albany to New York, but with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference. Behind Buffalo are the Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lakes, and around the Great Lakes is three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifths of the farming land of the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States, mostly given over to wheat in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, and now to wheat and corn. Wheat is</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that can be stored and kept for</seg><seg type="columnLine">months, or even years. It is easily handled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in tonnage is among the largest items</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the railroads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Erie Canal, like the Hudson River,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was closed in winter by ice. If Vanderbilt</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to hoist freight rates on wheat during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the winter, the wheat owner, or shipper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly stored his wheat, or else saw that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shipped before the cold weather came</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, often over Vanderbilt's own road at sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer-canal rates, leaving it without tonnage</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the winter, and with too much tonnage</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the other months, especially in the early</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall of the year.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this led to a long and bitter fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was settled at length by a steady all-the-</seg><seg type="columnLine">year-round freight rate on wheat between</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buffalo and New York, and what forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">this rate was the Erie Canal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How the Erie Canal Governs Rates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In time, Chicago became the great wheat</seg><seg type="columnLine">mart, and the New York Central obtained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Lake Shore from Buffalo to Chicago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making practically one railroad from Chi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cago to New York. As wheat was still the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great east-bound item of freight tonnage, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">price charged through the Erie Canal con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued to control the rates. Then came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pennsylvania and other lines into Chicago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all seeking to haul wheat. To get business</seg><seg type="columnLine">these lines had to meet the New York Cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tral's freight rates on wheat to New York,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thus we see the influence of the Erie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canal spreading over the railroads running</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Chicago to Philadelphia via Pitts-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burgh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> St. Louis also handles much wheat, corn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and live stock, and as there are railroads</seg><seg type="columnLine">running from St. Louis to Chicago to get</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   10	R R</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the hauling of wheat from St. Louis to Phil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">adelphia, the rate must not be more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">from St. Louis to Chicago plus that from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago to New York, all of which are con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolled by the same slow-going Erie Canal</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We are pretty far west here, and the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing applies as we go south or farther west.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each new rate is necessarily based on, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed by, some other rate already in exist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence, and each is still controlled by the Erie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canal rate. Between Denver and Chicago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, many things move that the Erie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canal does not carry; say, for instance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes going west. But remember the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"empty car haul," and our friend going by</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage from Albany to New York? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">same thing applies to every line of travel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passenger express or freight not only in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States, but in the world, so the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denver-Chicago lines can be no exception.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Multiplicity of Cause and Effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Things now become more complicated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we have to deal with " through cars,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is, cars loaded in San Francisco or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seattle for New York, Boston, or New Or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leans, that travel over many different lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">of railroad. Also we have water competition</seg><seg type="columnLine">around South America, and in some cases</seg><seg type="columnLine">even around the world via the Suez Canal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All these routes deeply affect the price of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauling a box of shoes or a ton of coal</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Raton, New Mexico, to Boston, or to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charleston, South Carolina.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We have seen enough, however, to under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand how the Erie Canal is the founda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion on which all United States freight rates</seg><seg type="columnLine">are directly or indirectly based.

Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">again we had better resort to an illustration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As every one knows, coal is widely dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tributed over the United States, but its</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality varies greatly. The best coal, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard, smokeless kind, comes from around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pittsburgh, while the coal of Wyoming is</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft and sooty, though it may be burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a locomotive boiler.

The demand for coal is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady the year round, as the domestic, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">household, demand almost ceases in sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer and comes in with a rush in fall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here is as pretty a problem in the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">king of freight rates as any one could wish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a problem that the most radical reform rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">expert, hired by some local traffic bureau,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would ponder over many a long day before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he even approached anything like a solu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. But to get back to the illustration, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which this paragraph has been a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">outline.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We will say that Jones has a mine of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard coal in Pennsylvania and mines soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">coal as a by-product. His chief market is</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York City, where he disposes of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard coal, but cannot sell his soft coal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He has to mine the soft coal to get out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard coal, and to throw it away would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a criminal waste, so he can afford to sell</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soft coal in Chicago at almost any price</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the freight rate from Pittsburgh to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He goes to the Pennsylvania freight man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after much figuring that individual</seg><seg type="columnLine">tells him that the road will haul the coal</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Chicago for cost almost, rather than see</seg><seg type="columnLine">it go to waste; say, for about half a cent a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pound, or $10 a ton. This is out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question, however, because practically the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same coal is already selling in Chicago for</seg><seg type="columnLine">$5 a ton, and to market coal in Chicago</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire Pittsburgh man must sell for no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than $5 a ton and pay his freight rate out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that $5.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Considering the empty car haul and va-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rious other things, the railroad at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes the Pittsburgh man a rate of §3 a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, who then ships his soft coal to Chi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cago, and sells it for $4 a ton, §1 under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rate of coal mined in Illinois.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Losing Money to Make More.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So	far so good, but the Illinois coal miner</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once goes to see the freight man of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Illinois Central, and says:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It costs me $2 to mine my soft coal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">your road charges me $2 a ton to haul it</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Chicago, and I am selling it at S5,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making SI profit.

To haul an empty car, by the way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">costs practically four-fifths of what it does</seg><seg type="columnLine">to haul the same car loaded. This, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other hand, would be a criminal waste, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be foolish to haul empty cars for</seg><seg type="columnLine">$4 when they can be hauled loaded for $5.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One argument against the "keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">every one in business" idea is that each</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the country should stand on its own</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, and if Pittsburgh can sell coal in Chi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cago cheaper than can the Illinois miners,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the Illinois miners have no business</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run their mines.

We have still another</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter to consider when it comes to making</seg><seg type="columnLine">freight rates, however. It is this, odd as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it may seem: The weaker railroad makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suppose for an illustration we take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denver and Rio Grande and the Union Pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cific between Salt Lake City and Denver.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Union Pacific has much the better</seg><seg type="columnLine">grade, less than two per cent, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denver and Rio Grande, running over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher and steeper mountain passes in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">148</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Rockies between the two cities, has grades</seg><seg type="columnLine">as high as five per cent.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Union Pacific can make a good profit at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rate that would ruin the Denver and Rio</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grande.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the old days, when railroads fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the death, a stronger road would thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">bankrupt the weaker road, buy it in, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">add it to its system.

She was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reader of those cheap novels of Gotham life</seg><seg type="columnLine">which are written for the benefit of the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versed provincial. So it ended by the store</seg><seg type="columnLine">being sold and the removal of the family to</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their cash went in short order and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">several directions, but mainly by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tiny grocery-store, the " good-will " of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was sold them at a price of many dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars. The store had had about half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenants in as many, months, and the neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">borhood abounded in thieving urchins who</seg><seg type="columnLine">filched industriously.

Mrs. O'Hare</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a good-sized widow who had a heart as</seg><seg type="columnLine">big as her fist. Her son drove a truck for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wholesale grocery, and was an active mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of the West Street Young Men's Golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rod Association, which, as its name implied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an organization for the purpose of ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">king possible nightly bouts with the gloves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. O'Hare herself " went out days," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was also a sporadic understudy for a char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman in a certain sky-scraper.

Altogether there was a suggestion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sturdy if paintless independence about the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cottage that somehow or other seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in keeping with its tenants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Yez'll come right over to th' house,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Mrs. O'Hare to Rupe's father as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter was locking the door of the grocery-</seg><seg type="columnLine">store for the last time.

"Heart,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the doctor, but she had gone as flowers</seg><seg type="columnLine">go when cut from their life-roots and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prived of air, light, and nourishment. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">day following the funeral Rupe's father got</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work that might have kept her alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Six months passed. The gap in Rupe's</seg><seg type="columnLine">life seemed deeper and darker than ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dead mother had shared with him an</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost passionate love of the country, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which she only became conscious when too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late. So, during her lifetime, Rupe, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom of his city existence, had managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to abstract lots of comfort from his talks</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his mother about the chickens and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pigeons and birds and trees and flowers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other things that they had left behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But all that was dead; and to the dumb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aching sense of his bereavement was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">added loss of the consolation which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">derived from being able to tell her his hopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and desires which were shaped on the basis</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a return to the country. She, too, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last weeks of her life, confided to him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">which she did not even tell her husband--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she also longed with the feverish long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of a wounded spirit for the quiet of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Because of their longing for the old life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither Rupe nor his mother could ever root</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves in the city soil. So the lad had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been more or less lonely, notwithstanding his</seg><seg type="columnLine">attendance at public school and the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was a real boy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH THE GOING OF MOTHER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">155</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In spite of a somewhat delicate constitu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. he could have made a lot of chums</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he so chosen; but the ways'of the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys were not his ways, neither was their talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">his talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Being a wholesome-minded youngster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rupe did not see the fun in a lot of things</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the precocious small New Yorkers did</seg><seg type="columnLine">or fancied. To make matters worse, Rupe's</seg><seg type="columnLine">father was one of those men who cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">give surface indication of their really affec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionate dispositions. Had it been otherwise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rupe would have loved him more and suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered less. As it was, everything seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go with the going of the mother, for the fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther was temperamentally incapable of ta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">king the lost one's place even to a minor</seg><seg type="columnLine">degree--although, to do him justice, he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shortcoming in this respect very keenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the throbbing and thunder of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulses quieted again, the silence of the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">became oppressive, for it stood back some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what from the avenue, and the roar of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">traffic was deadened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Rupe wasn't a bit scared. He tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find surcease from the sorrow which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so strong upon him in "make believe."</seg><seg type="columnLine">This time his imagination was strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to garment the hard facts of his loss</seg><seg type="columnLine">or his surroundings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The coral island proving a failure, Rupe</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran the whole gamut of his pet imagings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">including being treed by a bear, being a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipwrecked mariner floating on a raft, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner in a pirate's cave, hunting and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hunted by Indians, and the like--in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which the couch, the carpet strip, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree played prominent parts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His "properties" were few and mostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">made by himself, except an air-gun which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although out of commission, was his most</seg><seg type="columnLine">valued possession. But each and every one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his small mental dramas failed to ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terialize.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A curtain of tear-mist was wrung down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them almost as soon as they began.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then there was the cough, too. Rupe</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally gave up the attempt, and lay quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the couch, looking backward and upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the narrow strip of blue sky visible be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the copings of the big buildings that</seg><seg type="columnLine">flanked the cottage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A snowy sea-gull, crossing from the Hud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son to the East River, suddenly floated into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue, and as suddenly passed out of sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the block coping. Rupe, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts were with his mother, raised him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self and uttered a cry of wonder and long-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. To his overwrought imagination the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird, for the moment, had seemed an angel</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the angel of his mother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the passing of the hope and the fan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cy came an added sense of his loss. Turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">over on his side, the little boy began to sob</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heart out--the hot tears rolling down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope of the horsehair in quick and glistening</seg><seg type="columnLine">succession.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently the outburst passed. Once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fixed his eyes on the sky.' On the coping</seg><seg type="columnLine">were half a dozen sparrows holding a chirp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing conference. The chirk-chirk of the birds</seg><seg type="columnLine">only served to remind him of how his moth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er used to translate bird-talk into all sorts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of funny things. Again the eyes filled. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was learning--indeed, he had learned--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitiful lesson that it is only when we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved and lost that we realize how intimately</seg><seg type="columnLine">entwined with our daily lives are the tendrils</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a lost love.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the avenue came the shrill, inspiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistle of a fire-engine. About the one thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the big, weary city for which Rupe had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuine love was a fire-engine. But in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">instance the whistle summoned in vain. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">call became fainter and fainter, and Rupe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering just why he hadn't cared to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the window of the front room to look out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the silence and the loneliness fall all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavier when the sound ceased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the mantelpiece was a small alarm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clock that had a little ship on its face which</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled heavily at every tick.

When Mason ran this coyote spec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">imen out of Denver some years before, Texas</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charlie had crossed the range to Hot Sul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phur Springs.

To simplify matters, Texas</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charlie decided to kill the whole outfit. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">intentions, when confided to Hot Sulphur,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although not entirely unexpected, did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet with enthusiastic approval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Texas Charlie was lounging in a chair tilt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed back on two legs against the front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elk Horn saloon. Diagonally across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street was the Palace of Liquid Delight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside of which were many men. The Palace</seg><seg type="columnLine">door was closed. This door was famous</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the country for having the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">white door-knob in Middle Park. Texas</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charlie, in calm contempt of such vanity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, incidentally, to test his nerve that</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, carelessly 'Slipped one of his ivory-</seg><seg type="columnLine">handled 45's out of its holster and delib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erately began to use that White door-knob</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a bull's-eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fired three shots. Ten years later</seg><seg type="columnLine">those bullet-holes through the Palace door</seg><seg type="columnLine">were one of the sights the tenderfoot tourists</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly sought in Hot Sulphur Springs. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady's hand could easily cover all three</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet-holes, as none of them missed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door-handle by over an inch. The distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">was perhaps forty yards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the first bullet ripped a long splin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter off the inside of the Palace door, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen or more men lounging in the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fluid joy knew that trouble was afoot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Under the tables, out the side windows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back door they bolted. The other two</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets sang through an empty room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such incidents were annoying to the own-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers of the Palace, and, incidentally, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire population of Hot Sulphur. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets missed killing or maiming some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a rare chance. Texas Charlie did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know and did not care. All winter he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrorized Hot Sulphur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One man, early in the winter, had dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to oppose him and had been shot in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back.

Through (lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">winter the wounded man suffered; in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring his tired life flickered out.

The people of Middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Park saw excuse enough in his frozen boot</seg><seg type="columnLine">for quitting as mail-carrier, but his mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roseness they neither understood nor liked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the ranch where he was slowly winning</seg><seg type="columnLine">back the splendid poise that had always</seg><seg type="columnLine">characterized him was owned by a peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">family -- Mississippians by the name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lawson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This family was as self-hiding as Mason</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become; and they, too, were neither un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstood nor liked in Middle Park. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">one could openly say a word against them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for no one knew anything about them: their</seg><seg type="columnLine">main fault seemed to be in attending strictly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their own business and insisting--none</seg><seg type="columnLine">too courteously--that their far-away neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bors do the same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet there were many whispers. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hinted that the Lawsons were wanted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own Stafe for moonshining. Old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lawson had found Mason, homeless and</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless, at Chipmunk's a week after Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's meeting with Salarado on the range,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he had taken the disabled mail-carrier</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the southern hospitality of the Lawson</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch. Both men were educated--thanks</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Mason's bookstore--both minded their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own affairs; one was injured and without</seg><seg type="columnLine">home or friends, the other had been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Therefore, Mason had gone to live with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Lawsons. Their indoor warmth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome he shared as one of the family;</seg><seg type="columnLine">also, the outdoor coldness and dislike. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">put him in bad odor. Why? None could</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell. Besides, all unarmed, Mason had once</seg><seg type="columnLine">been seen to walk up to Texas Charlie and</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk long and friendly with that bully, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex^s Charlie had treated Mason with pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">found respect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mountaineers are clannish -- be it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scotland, the Alps, or the Rockies. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mason, the Lawsons, and Texas Charlie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each widely different and in no way con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected, were under the whispered social</seg><seg type="columnLine">ban. Texas Charlie had died with his boots</seg><seg type="columnLine">011, and side-eyes were cast at the Lawsons</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As neither Mason nor the Lawsons gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the reason for this sudden and unfath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">omable friendship, it was said that strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">comradeship is only rooted in suspicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something was being hatched at the Law-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son ranch.

For a minute tense</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">silence reigned. The hoary head of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cider Lawson raised and the eyes flittered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from face to face, hope dying in them. No</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "My boys--my boys," he whispered, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the head sunk down to the quivering breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mike and Pete Lawson stolidly faced their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">accusers. Mason's keen, strong face was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bitterly disdainful, his lithe form without</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">moving grew haughty; he looked over the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">herd of men as if they were sheep. Then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the steady eyes rested on the broken old</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">father tied beside him, and grew strangely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">soft.	*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Brutes!" said a sweet-faced woman in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a farm-wagon on the outer edge of the gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">12 RR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ering. "It is time we were going." She</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke to her daughter, but the dreamy girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not answer. She was gazing at Mason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Have the prisoners anything to say for</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves?" asked Uncle Billy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowd began to yell.

Mason</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at Uncle Billy, and said quietly:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Uncle Billy faced the crowd, raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand for silence, waited a moment, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved his hat, and said solemnly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Men, by your vote it will now be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided.

Perhaps it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been dangerous, for that crowd (</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ugly.

Are these men to die? "</seg><seg type="columnLine">The word was too ghastly. It came too</seg><seg type="columnLine">near home for each man to say it, but in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence every right arm in the crowd pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to heaven.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Men! " Uncle Billy's voice shook.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Controlling it, he said slowly--and no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that band of mountaineers gathered to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">frontier justice ever forgot that tone or those</seg><seg type="columnLine">words:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Men, you are to die for cattle-stealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for the murder of Robert Adams.

Curley and Snorts</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to prepare their cow-ropes. Chip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munk pulled a coil of half-inch hemp from</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the wagon-seat. In the wagon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old door, on which a limp body could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried with less trouble than with the bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. Then Mason's voice rang out de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiantly:</seg><seg type="columnLine">178</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Loosen these cords and give me a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk like a man, not like a bound dog!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't be afraid.

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Uncle Billy looked with surprise. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped stiffly from the wagon, drew his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket-knife, and cut the bonds. Chip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munk dropped the coil of rope back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon and pulled out his shotgun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let him talk if he wants to--won't do</seg><seg type="columnLine">him any good--but I'll see he don't get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away," muttered the surly old trapper as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood guard over the now free prisoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mason vaulted into the wagon. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd was hostile, but icily respectful. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, built of straight lines and angles; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">puma form, that subtle something in men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">good or bad--magnetism, personality, call it</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you will--wrung from the crowd the</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneasy conviction that they faced their su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perior. In a clear, even voice, free from</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion, Mason said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Men of Middle Park--What I say to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you is true, as my words themselves will</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you.

You may kill me--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but do not murder them. They are inno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent. Set them free. I alone am guilty. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed Bob Adams; no one else even knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. Hang me--but free them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A great sigh came from the crowd. Chip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munk lowered his shotgun. Uncle Billy</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed into the wagon, raised his hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and asked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Shall they go free? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Turn 'em loose," spoke Chipmunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I second it," added Snorts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shall they go free and this man die?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated Uncle Billy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was an unconscious lingering on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that word "man." A murmur like distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">•waves at night voiced the sentence. Mason,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing by Uncle Billy's side in the wagon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the sentence with folded arms. Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy stooped down and picked up several</seg><seg type="columnLine">rawhide strings. Mason, the self-confessed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bound--ankle, knee, and elbow--just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Chipmunk's knife cut the cords of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other prisoners and they stepped forth free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man's palsied fingers closed round</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quiet hand of the bending -figure in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon. The patriarch could not speak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then brother Pete pressed the other hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then turned away. Mike, the youngest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Good-by, Mason. Die game. You'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have company before long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two brothers smiled quietly into each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other's eyes. They understood and believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Southern feud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mason shook his head, and said quietly:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, not that. One man is enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forgive it. L ask it." The two Lawson</seg><seg type="columnLine">brothers did not respond. Their lips were</seg><seg type="columnLine">set like steel-traps. Then the circle opened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and through the grimly respectful lane the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man and the two sons passed. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried along the trail to get as far away as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible from their horror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snorts shot his rope into the air, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhed over a limb. Many hands on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spokes wheeled the wagon under it. Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy grabbed the loop, put it over Mason's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, and drew it close about the neck--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Hallo, there! What's goin'on? Hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in' 'lection ? " came a cheery call.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the voice o'f Bob Adams. Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's face glorified. Hot Sulphur whirled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There, beyond doubt, in a travel-mudded</seg><seg type="columnLine">buckboard on the road the other side the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence, sat Bob Adams, grinning sheepishly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beside him was the strange face of a buxom</seg><seg type="columnLine">lass of twenty, in flushing confusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Ghosts!

Nigger Tob</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly drew forth a rabbit's foot, stroked it</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantically, and gasped:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Haunts!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Hot Sulphur recovered. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed, and a few shuddered. Chipmunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">swore briefly, but to the point.

Uncle Billy slashed Mason</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose. The first man to capture Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adams's right paw was Mason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ouch!" yelled the groom. "What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">you doin'? Don't cripple a feller," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">howled as he rubbed his stinging hand on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knee while he beamingly watched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-confessed murderer bare his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverently raise the bride's fingers to his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the turmoil had settled somewhat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adams managed to make himself heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No; my rifle wasn't empty. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the cartridges were stolen out of the hay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shed, I still had some left in the magazine</seg><seg type="columnLine">--half a dozen or so. Uncle Billy got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong idea about that. Ridin' along in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain, I saw a deer and wanted meat. I let</seg><seg type="columnLine">him have three shots. Those were the shells</seg><seg type="columnLine">you found in the thicket near the trail. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was where I sneaked up to get in good range.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I didn't open the new boxes because of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain--had enough without.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I got the buck hog--dressed him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied the meat to the saddle.

He pulled the deer off in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the timber. That is where the blood on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle-blanket came from. The rain washed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and the deer-hairs off the saddle.

From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buckboard the team was unhooked. Cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pagne Charlie jerked his rope from the limb</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knotted the loop to the tongue. Twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily mounted men on excited horses fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get hold of it. Away they went, in ir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular double file, galloping into town. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swaying buckboard, the bride was cling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to her husband, and he was ostenta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiously holding her in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the wagon Shorts pulled the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.

But his face was strangely drawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " What'd he say he done it for?

Then came the messengers on</seg><seg type="columnLine">running horses, then the revelation. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">they refused to return to Hot Sulphur. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the lone ranch, on toward home, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">went. They now rode the horses that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">bten thrust on them, while the bearers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad tidings trotted back to Hot Sulphur on</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They arrived just in time to hear Mason,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing in Adams's buckboard, say:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. I thank you, but I cannot stay to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dance.

Three miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, in clear view, lay Old Maco's sheep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch. Ten miles beyond, farther out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desert by the Great Water Hole, was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexican town. It had taken the buffalo a</seg><seg type="columnLine">week to travel from the Spire to almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">within touch of Mexie. Salarado had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">his journey leisurely. No one saw him on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road. Salarado took good care of that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mutton was well warmed, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooked.

Slipping to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet, Salarado glided through the sage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush on an easy run for the now empty hut.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In twenty minutes he reached the side away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the corral. Crawling through the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">square window, he found himself in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridal chamber. When he knew where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, there was a gleam in his eyes that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a red coal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard Mexie coming. He knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">springing footfall. Behind her came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stump-scrape-stump-scrape that brought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips a dark smile. At the door he heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexie turn and say, angrily:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Get out, you old coyote. Can't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave me alone for an instant? Come in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this house before sundown, and I'll kick</seg><seg type="columnLine">you out of it! Vamose! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A whine answered her, then a cracked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">complaining grumble grew fainter and faint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er as the scrape-and-stump sound receded</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the corral.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mexie entered the adobe alone. Salarado</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not moved. For an instant Mexie</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted, paled, and gasped. Then she raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">her lips and held out her arms. Salarado</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed his teeth good-naturedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Come here," he commanded softly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexie, with half-closed eyelids, obeyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was earlv in the afternoon. At sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down Mexie went to the door and called:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maco! Oh, Maco! My husband, come</seg><seg type="columnLine">here! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her voice had in it a note--gentle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooing--that Old Maco had never heard be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore. The words to his ears were music.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not since he had cowed his bride three days</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, with six-shooter in one hand and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattle-whip in the other, had he known any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing but jeers and revilings when her sullen</seg><seg type="columnLine">consent had at times overboiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Maco, with an eager whimper, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a stumbling, shuffling run. As he tum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled through the door, a great, dark arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">throttled him. With starting eyeballs--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not see what held him--he saw Mexie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wife, calmly unbuckle the cartridge-belt</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which hung his six-shooter and bowie-</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife, and toss them across the room onto the</seg><seg type="columnLine">straw bed. Then Salarado turned him loose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helpless, yet with frantic rage, the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">cripple attacked Mexie and Salarado with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his withered arms and crippled legs. Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodged him, held him off at arm's length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed at him. For an hour they played</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the old miser, like two cats tormenting</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rat. In this case the cats agreed. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no wish to eat him; they only wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kill him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Played out, the old cripple sank in dumb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless fury to the floor. Mexie tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">provoke him to more sport, but he only</seg><seg type="columnLine">glared at her. Then she curled her lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">in disappointed weariness and smiled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Salarado and said, " Finish him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Salarado laid aside his cigarette. He took</seg><seg type="columnLine">his time and used no weapons--only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">bronze hand on the wheezing, loose-skinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He buried the twisted body in the gate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of the sheep-corral.

What cared Salarado?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the day the caged and chained</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperado was an object of morbid curiosity</seg><seg type="columnLine">to every one. Human nature is the same the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world over. As long as daylight lasted, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaping face was framed and barred by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one little window, a foot square, that con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected Salarado's prison with the outer air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The jailer, from Maine many'years be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, had at first turned his prisoner into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">source of profit. Two-bits was the price</seg><seg type="columnLine">he demanded for the privilege of looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the little window. The crowd be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to grumble. They were in a hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">mood that day. The jailer, being no fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">and having lived long in the West, suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">found his heart bubbling over with gener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">osity for his fellow man; and, thereafter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window was public property, free to all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This lasted all day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clearly, nothing toward escape could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done literally under the eye of the public.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Salarado contemptuously turned his back to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the window ;.nd thought out a plan of escape</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--and revenge. The plan completed, lie</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">calmly went to sleep till supper-time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Salarado was fed twice a day, morning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and evening. That night the jailer, armed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a six-shooter and bowie-knife, un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">locked the wooden jail door and carried in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Salarado's supper. Not being naturally a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hard-hearted man, the jailer, at the prison-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">er's request, added one or two little luxuries</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the evening meal. Bread and butter and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a bottle of whisky were the dainties asked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for and given.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   A stifling storm of wind and flying, cut-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ting sand was raging over the town that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">night. Hence, the little window was closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Every one, including the jailer, was driven</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to shelter by the storm. Salarado was left</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">alone and unobserved, although heavily</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chained and safely caged. The jailer, hav-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">y ing no handcuffs nor leg-irons, and being</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">also without suitable padlocks, had fastened</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Salarado's hands together with two feet of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chain bound to the wrists with thick baling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wire, twisted tight with blacksmith pincers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Human fingers, working unaided, could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not undo them--but Salarado used his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">His legs were fastened in the same way,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the leg chaining in turn was fastened to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a ring in the middle of the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was no sleep for Salarado that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">night. Had he not slept all afternoon?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Had not Salarado all day to-morrow to doze</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">away? Salarado had work to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   A silk handkerchief, the gift of Mexie and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">formerly the property of their murdered vic-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tim, was knotted around the prisoner's neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Salarado was something of a dandy. Un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">raveling the handkerchief, Salarado obtained</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a number of silk threads. A candle, also</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the gift of the jailer, gave him light. Sala-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rado was always ready to extinguish it by a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quick puff if he should hear the little win-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dow or the door being opened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He would claim that the violent wind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">coming in through the window had blown</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out the flame. Meanwhile; under the mo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mentary cover of darkness, he would hastily</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">conceal his means of escape if surprised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The jailer, knowing of no way that a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shackled man with no tools nor other aid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could either break out or cut a good, wrought-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">iron log-chain with links a quarter of an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inch thick, nor untwist heavy wire that had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been wound close with pincers, snored the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hours away and left Salarado to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The jailer was dealing with the concentrated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cussedness and cunning of thirteen races,</seg><seg type="columnLine">182</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and knew it not.

Then, striking the neck of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle against his chains, he broke it off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Putting this glass into a tin-cup used as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mortar, and with a link of his chain as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pestle, in a few moments he had a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of powdered glass. With it he</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixed a little butter, and slightly thinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mixture with whisky. This mess he</seg><seg type="columnLine">smeared over a silk thread.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here was Salarado's saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fastening one end of the thread to a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">truding nail-head in the floor, and holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other end between his white teeth, Sala-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rado lightly but rapidly rubbed one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">many bands of wire on his left wrist up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the taut string. The powdered glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the thread, aided by the butter, cut into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soft wire like a file. Soon the thread</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke. Another was quickly prepared, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sawing went on. Before morning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron links at his wrists and ankles, a strand</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wire on each, had been all but cut in two.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only a shred of metal held them together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Salarado then took bread, blackened it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the charcoal from burned matches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixed with it a little candle-grease, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this mixture concealed the bright cuts in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire. The broken threads were burned in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the candle-flame. The powdered glass was</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured through a crack in the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Salarado was almost free. A single wrench</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those tigerlike muscles would free him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from fetters.

Outside, the sandy sleet drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morbid from the door. The jury were</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone within the mud wall. The adobe on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outside was deserted. The town was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a-sleep, drunk, gambling, or dancing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the freezing, stinging, choking</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm a bent figure fought its way.

The jailer pushed the key into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the padlock that fastened the huge iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">staple on the outside of the prison door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He paused for breath.

Four terrific twists with those small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">steely hands, and the cut'wircs snapped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unwound. Salarado was free from chains.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In one hand he held a two-foot log-chain--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a terrible weapon in the hands of a strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">and desperate man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The candle burned in the neck of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty bottle on the floor in the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. As noiselessly as his shadow, Sala-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rado moved to within a yard of the still</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed door. There he stood, every muscle</seg><seg type="columnLine">alert, tense, and quivering, close against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. The door, grinding on its sanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">hinges, was cautiously opened an inch. A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">whirl of sand and frozen rain smote it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled it open and back against the inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall with a crash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The light went out.
