                        <ab>WITH LISTERINE, DANDRUFF GONE IN 30 DAYS</ab>
                        <ab>In a New Jersey clinic, 76% of the patients who used Listerine twice a day, showed either complete disappearance of, or marked improvement in, symptoms of dandruff in a
                            month.</ab>

                        <ab>Listerine attacks the Cause of dandruff, not merely its Symptoms. In a New Jersey clinic, 76% of patients got quick relief. Thousands hail the successful results of
                            Listerine Antiseptic.</ab>
                        <ab>If your hair is dull and lifeless ... If your scalp lacks tone and vigor, itches and burns ...</ab>
                        <ab>If dandruff bothers you temporarily or chronically ...</ab>
                        <ab>Start right now with the delightful Listerine treatment--the only treatment, so far as we know, backed by clinical evidence that dandruff can be cured.</ab>
                        <ab>Tomorrow, your hair will look cleaner and feel healthier.</ab>
                        <ab>Your scalp will begin to tingle with new invigoration. Those ugly dandruff scales will begin to disappear as if by magic.</ab>
                        <ab>Nothing complicated about this proved treatment. Just douse Listerine on the scalp and accompany it with vigorous massage by the</ab>

                        <ab>fingertips. Do this once or twice a day, and keep it up systematically. Remember, dandruff is a germ infection and requires persistent treatment.</ab>
                        <ab>The moment Listerine goes on the scalp it bathes each hair in an antiseptic bath. Next it reaches deep down into the hair follicles and kills Pityrosporum ovale, the queer,
                            bottle- shaped germ which causes dandruff. Freed from this parasite, the follicle, the hair that penetrates it, and the scalp outside of it return to normal, gaining new
                            vigor and health. At the same time, Listerine permits healing of any irritation which may be present.</ab>
                        <ab>Once you try Listerine Antiseptic for dandruff, you will echo what thousands are saying: "The surest, most delightful remedy ever."</ab>

                        <ab>DO OTHERS OFFER PROOF? Before you invest a single penny in any remedy claiming to relieve dandruff, ask yourself: Has it been subjected to authentic research by competent
                            authorities? Arc its claims backed by ample clinical and laboratory proof? So far as we know, only Listerine offers such proof. On its scientific record alone, it stands
                            forth as the truly effective treatment for dandruff.</ab>

                    </ab>
                    <ab>BRONCHOS for bad boys--that's the prescription of W. H. Mitchell, former psychiatrist at the Kansas State Penitentiary. At his Sunset ranch near Boulder, Colorado, he has gone
                        into the business of rehabilitating youths who are on the verge of losing control of themselves.</ab>
                    <ab>Mr. Mitchell accepts commitments by juvenile judges, but prefers to discover boys who are on the "ragged edge" before they appear in court. This contact is made through parents
                        who realize that their sons are taking steps which are leading them toward trouble and beyond the barriers accepted by society. The aim is to restore youths to normalcy when
                        they are threatened with losing their grip on contact with others.</ab>
                    <ab>Consistent discipline is used by Mr. Mitchell in helping the boys solve problems with which they are confronted. The "split" discipline exercised by a doting mother and a stern
                        father or the reverse is of no help to the maladjusted youth, the psychiatrist believes.</ab>
                    <ab>The Sunset ranch boys who become adjusted to school life are enrolled in Boulder High School, while those faced with maladjustment in their school work are tutored at the
                        ranch. Each boy has two horses for which he must care. He makes his own bed, and has certain obligations to meet. Conferences are held with the youths to aid them in freeing
                        themselves of either inferiority complexes or egoism.</ab>

                    <ab>FLEEING BANDITS STOPPED: By a gun in the hands of Doctor F. L. Hardy, a dentist who maintained offices across from the bank in Midland, Michigan, which was being held up.
                        Because of a wave of bank robberies throughout Michigan, Doctor Hardy had kept his deer gun handy for some months. The doctor is a member of a group of business men who have
                        formed a vigilante organization as a protection against banditry. The doctor's gun killed one bandit and wounded two others.</ab>
                    <ab>RUM CONVICTIONS SOAR WITH REPEAL: More persons were sent to prison for Federal liquor law violations in 1937 than in any prohibition year. Prison commitments for liquor law
                        violations reached a high of 5,390 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1937. The highest during any year of prohibition was 5,045 in 1932.</ab>
                    <ab>ILLICIT LIQUOR: Is now generally sold as such. Thus we see the bootleggers openly defying the liquor laws. The past summer saw the arrest and indictment of the largest liquor
                        ring uncovered since repeal. The ring operated by buying denatured alcohol and diverting it in stills in New York, New Jersey and Maryland, then redistributing it and selling
                        it for bootleg beverage manufacture.</ab>
                    <ab>ANOTHER HOUSING PROBLEM: The Federal government is plan- ning to establish its own prison for incorrigible women convicts, according to Department of Justice officials.
                        Approximately two hundred women serving Federal sentences now are confined in State and other prisons outside the Federal jurisdiction, under an arrangement made by the
                        government with local authorities. Attorney General Homer Cummings in his report to Congress said the problem of housing women convicts had become acute.</ab>

                    <ab>GUARDS FOR THE MILLIONS OF MIDAS: Contrary to general opinion, army regulars are not guarding the United States gold-storage vault at Fort Knox, Kentucky, though they are
                        available for emergency call. The guards at the vault must be civil-service men. They are all stalwart able-bodied men, and trained by officers of the coast guard who are
                        strict disciplinarians as well as very proficient in the use of firearms. The salary is one thousand six hundred and eighty dollars per year. An elaborate system of protective
                        devices has been installed, but no chances will be taken. A regular interior patrol will be maintained.</ab>
                    <ab>CRIME IN SLUMS: According to a recent survey, fifty-eight per cent of the criminals arrested in Manhattan were born and grew up in slum districts.</ab>
                    <ab>PRISONERS STAGE SIT-DOWN: Three New York City drug addicts staged a sit-down strike in the Criminal Courts detention pen, forcing the three justices of Special Sessions to
                        descend a flight of stairs to sentence them. The three prisoners refused to get up off the floor even when the black-robed judges stood before them. The trio got the limit--up
                        to three years at Rikers Island Penitentiary.</ab>
                    <ab>BANDITS BLAME STORK: Each of five young married men arrested in Brooklyn, New York, on robbery charges pleaded that his wife was expecting a baby. The five prospective fathers
                        who said they did it for the unborn, according to police, admitted holding up ten places in Brooklyn.</ab>
                    <ab>AS A CURB ON CRIME: All persons seeking employment in Miami Beach, Florida, must carry an identification card. This card is only issued after the applicant has been
                        fingerprinted and the prints cleared of all suspicion by the bureau of investigation at Washington. The same ordinance requires registration within forty-eight hours after
                        arrival, under a maximum penalty of sixty days' imprisonment and a fine of one hundred dollars.</ab>

                        Federal prison reports show that the present prison population is only four hundred short of an all-time record. According to the bureau of prison estimates, normal capacity is
                        thirteen thousand seven hundred and forty-three, but there are fifteen thousand two hundred and ninety-five prisoners housed in Federal institutions.</ab>
                    <ab>New crime laws, new liquor laws, and the aggressive campaign against crime waged by the G-men are contributory factors to the increased prison population.</ab>

                        word is usually a vowel. Second and third from last are usually vowels. Watch for endings, ION, ING, and S.</ab>
