Every Monday morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing finds the highways littered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken glass, wrecks, cars in the ditch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">overturned, shattered against telephone</seg><seg type="columnLine">posts.

O'Conor Sloane, Ph.D.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE discovery that a chemical combination was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">addition of two or more things and that the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">binations were always in the same ratio of weights</seg><seg type="columnLine">or of multiples thereof, were so much the basis</seg><seg type="columnLine">of modern chemistry that it is taken as the foun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dation stone of all we know. Simple and obvious</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it seems, the centuries of work of the alchemists</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scientists of olden days got them nowhere, and it was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the breaking out of the French Revolution that Lavoisier</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Paris and Priestly, who had recently come over from England</seg><seg type="columnLine">to America, had made the discovery each independent of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. Priestly did his work in Pennsylvania. Lavoisier did</seg><seg type="columnLine">his in Paris, so naturally enough America claims the beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of chemistry, as also does France.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lavoisier was connected with the government of France as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Collector of the Revenues and naturally, being a distinctively</seg><seg type="columnLine">great man, he improved everything he touched. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great things wanted in those days was potassium nitrate for</seg><seg type="columnLine">making gunpowder, and he improved the collection of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">and did away with the very obnoxious system of visiting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellars of private houses in the hope of finding sources for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">salt. But when the Revolution broke out, the work Lavoisier</seg><seg type="columnLine">did for the government on the side of its revenues told against</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and he was beheaded; he was one of the purest characters</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the French Revolution sent to the guillotine. There is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">story that he wanted to complete some chemical experiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">before being executed and that he was not permitted to do it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was told that the Republic had no need of chemists. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">decade or two later they found out that they had great need of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the necessities of modern life is soap, and to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard soap, as distinguished from soft soap, sodium carbonate is an</seg><seg type="columnLine">essential, so when France was cut off from Spain in her wars</seg><seg type="columnLine">with England she was cut off from a supply of the seaweed</seg><seg type="columnLine">called kelp. 1 his seaweed used to be collected in enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantities and its ashes yielded sodium carbonate. A prize</seg><seg type="columnLine">was offered for anyone who developed a process of making *</seg><seg type="columnLine">sodium carbonate from salt, of which sea water alone would</seg><seg type="columnLine">provide an endless quantity. France most emphatically needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Jiemist and found one. LeBlanc, a French chemist, developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wonderful soda-ash process which gave the desired alkali</seg><seg type="columnLine">from salt. It was a revolutionary discovery and the date of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">patent for it is 1792. Apparently the country did need a chemist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although the process is largely superseded now, at one time</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was probably the greatest chemical industry of the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was an old saying apropos of the development of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this_ process, to the effect that the civilization of a nation could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be judged by the quantity of soap it made. This is because</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the amount of soap it produced indicated the development of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the LeBlanc soda ash process.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lavoisier had been guillotined and poor LeBlanc, worn out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with disappointment, committed suicide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These episodes in the history.of chemistry seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">led us a little astray from our subject, so we will trv to return</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The establishment of the weight-relation of the constituents</seg><seg type="columnLine">of compounds lead to the development of the table of atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">weights, so we see that chemistry originated as a science of</seg><seg type="columnLine">weights and the chemist's balance, in a sense, became the symbol</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the new science.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Water was found o consist of eight parts by weight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen, to one part of hydrogen. A slight discrepancy in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydrogen was not discovered for many years. Accordingly it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was said that the water molecule consisted'of an atom of oxygen</seg><seg type="columnLine">combined with an atom of hydrogen, and with the rapid devel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">opment of chemical formulas this was accepted as the truth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Italian chemist, Avagadro, early in the last century brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the theory that equal volumes of all gases at the same tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perature and pressure contained the same number of mole-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cules. Now it is a very simple thing to decompose water by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the electric current and to collect the oxygen and hydrogen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each in its own receptacle for measurement. It was found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was exactly twice the volume of hydrogen in water</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was of oxygen. Avagadro's paper was published</seg><seg type="columnLine">in 1811. Water had always been called HO and the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure of chemical formulas was built up on this basis. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle of the last century the new system, as it is called,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which gave water for its formula HsO, modifying a vast num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of chemical formulas, was accepted by the more modern</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemists and quite a war was waged between the two schools</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we may call them. It is interesting to note that in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixties of the last century the authorities of Columbia College,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in New York, for it was not a university then, passed a reso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lution adopting what was called the new system, in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">water was H»0 instead of HO.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lavoisier and Priestly had made chemistry a science of rela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive weights and these weights applied whether the substance</seg><seg type="columnLine">was solid, liquid or gaseous. After Lavoisier's and Priestly's</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, the relation ol volumes of substances in the gaseous state</seg><seg type="columnLine">was developed by Avagadro, thus further modifying chemistry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The relation of weights of the atoms and molecules followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the identity of size of molecules in the gaseous state, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner-stones, for it now had two, in chemistry, and it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken the intellect of man 2,000 or more years to find this out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and convert alchemy into chemistry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miles J.

Even the faint crackling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speaker ceased, showing that the connection was off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin turned to Jack, whose burly form towered above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of them, and whose countenance showed a be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildered inability to grasp what it all meant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then the door opened and a police captain came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, followed by a squad of men in blue uniform. Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin recognized the captain as Guy Sherman Sentier, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old and close friend. Sentier stopped short and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You?" he gasped as he saw Quentin.

What have you done?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing!" said Quentin, calm by this time. "Go</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead. It's your duty.

He motioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his men, and turned his head away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The policemen came up, one of them grasping Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the arm. Jack whirled around and knocked the fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the room as easily as shaking off a rat. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he leaped away from the group that Lad come in through</seg><seg type="columnLine">an outer door, and in a moment had disappeared through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a door leading into the interior of the building. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">clatter of his swift footsteps died rapidly away into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muffled distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment the policemen stood aghast. They did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know quite how to behave, for never in their ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience had a prisoner made so bold as to try to escape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the world rigidly standardized and moving as one</seg><seg type="columnLine">unit, what hope could there be of escape?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a shout from the captain, they became active and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered through doors and windows in pursuit, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his thin black rod.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three remaining captives were handcuffed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man left in charge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin waited in patient resignation, for he knew it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not last long. Can one escape the lion in his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">den? The very walls of the building would combine</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hunt down the fugitive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the boy must have been swift and clever. Minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengthened into an hour; the guard stood stiff, me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanical, embarrassed. The huge building was silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">save for vague mechanical sounds. Then a faint shout</seg><seg type="columnLine">came across a courtyard through a window, and Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see Jack climbing down a drain pipe from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof. Two figures appeared on the roof above him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">others ran out of a door near by and waited for him 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground. As Jack came down within reach, one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guards touched him with the end of his slender,</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-foot rod. Jack dropped to the ground, limp and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralyzed. In a few moments he was wheeled into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office on a small cart, one of the policemen holding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rod in contact with Jack's arm. The boy lay helpless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes gazing mute inquiry into Quentin's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No use, Jack," Quentin said to him. "You're among</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilized people now, you know. You're no good against</seg><seg type="columnLine">police equipment. Promise them you'll go quietly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'll let you up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The policeman lifted the rod an instant, giving Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">power to nod his head in promise. Thereupon the police-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man put his rod away, and Jack stood up and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">about abashed. As the police led their captives out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sentier called after Quentin:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't hold this against me personally? May</seg><seg type="columnLine">I visit you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come. I shall be glad to see you," Quentin answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">philosophically. "Why should I blame you? You're a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny cog in a huge machine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS the captives were led into a barred and guarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, Quentin put his arm about Jack's big shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders in sympathy. He looked young to die; and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed like a betrayal, to be brought from that wild coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to see the wonders of the civilized world, and find</seg><seg type="columnLine">this. As the plane rose and headed for New York,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the euthanasia facilities were located, Jack seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">more absorbed in looking down at the Government Build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings which comprised the whole city of Washington, than</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the thought of impending death. He looked at Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin with bewilderment in his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That square massive building just below us is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one we were in? And you say that is the center, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain, the key of the whole World Government?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is the Government," Quentin replied. "Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as your brain is you. These other countless acres of</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings are merely its arms and fingers and eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears. Without this building they could not function, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world would be chaos."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack stared down fascinatedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And yet," he breathed in amazement, "I ran through</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles of corridors, passed hundreds of rooms full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus and instruments, and not a soul did I see."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin nodded in confirmation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For an hour I ran, and by the end of it I was caring</seg><seg type="columnLine">less about being caught than about finding some people</seg><seg type="columnLine">about in these buildings. Is there no one?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No one," Quentin replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And yet you say it's the Government!" The boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed dumfounded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After all my explaining," Quentin said, "haven't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that the Government is merely a huge machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of metal and rubber and glass and run by elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricity and light and heat?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But--but how can machinery govern the world?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Better than human beings can. Even your business</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in Democratia use machines to help them run their</seg><seg type="columnLine">businesses; their offices are full of automatic machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">for managing a business, time-clocks, adding-machines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bookkeeping machines, cash-registers, dictaphones--no</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of them. The Government Machine is not essenti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally different. Merely a little more automatic and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little more complex."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And are all the people willing to be governed by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine?" It was all amazingly strange to Jack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They cannot conceive of anything else," Quentin ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained. "For three hundred years they have grown up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it. They are intensely loyal to it, because it not merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">governs them as you understand the word govern; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes care of them as a mother takes care of children."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They seem to be happy," Jack observed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin nodded down toward the beautiful country-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side over which they were flying at a swift rate. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">green fields were intersected by broad roads and huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">power lines, and the blue bulk of a city loomed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The world is more prosperous than it has ever been</seg><seg type="columnLine">before," he replied. "Life is thoroughly comfortable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely safe and certain. But you would call it</seg><seg type="columnLine">monotonous. Everybody does everything by rule and</seg><seg type="columnLine">schedule, all alike, the world over. Standardize. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't like it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I couldn't stand it!" Jack exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your country, Democratia," continued Quentin, "is</seg><seg type="columnLine">made up of the descendants of people who couldn't stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. During the development period of machine govern-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ment standardization, the democratic-minded people, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not fit into it, were having a hard time. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">persecuted and driven from one place to another."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's unjust!" Jack was thoroughly democratic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They were a small minority. The rest of the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in earnest; it was afraid of annihilation by war. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">it built cities on a standard plan, streets and buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">all alike. From New York to Hongkong people live on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same schedule and think by the same rules. That is</seg><seg type="columnLine">easier to manage by machinery. Safer. More comfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack gazed for a while at the swiftly receding land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scape below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then why is the Government picking on Democratia</seg><seg type="columnLine">now?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It had to come. For some centuries your country</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Central Tibet was left in peace because its founders</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought the remotest possible isolation. Our Government</seg><seg type="columnLine">had its own problems. But, step by step it is striving</seg><seg type="columnLine">constantly to perfect the world. Apparently the step has</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived in the process when it is time to remove the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">exception to world rule."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And it sent you over there?" Jack shook his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Remember that the Government has no emotions nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">prejudices. It works absolutely by logic. It is always</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect in its fairness. A decision on Democratia needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">all possible informational data. As communication chan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nels do not extend into Democratia, men had to be sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And when you do a good job, you get killed for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Logical, though, is it not?" Quentin could be im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal when discussing the Government Machine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now I see why it warned me so emphatically that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was risking my life and gave me repeated opportunities</seg><seg type="columnLine">to decline the assignment if I wished to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Risking your life? In Democratia?" Jack exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not at all, although that is the way I understood it</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first. The Government needed a resourceful man for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the job, and resourceful men are rare in our civilization.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was the best bet--don't laugh at me; I know how help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less and clumsy you think I am--I took my risk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost it. For, this world cannot permit a resourceful man</seg><seg type="columnLine">to live in it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack hardly heard the conclusion. He was gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in open-mouthed wonder at the huge, solid mass of New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York City that loomed ahead, the cliffs of buildings, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surging masses of people and machinery. The plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">glided swiftly up above the dull, drab roofs, and landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the top of a building, guided by a long black streamer</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the top of a tall flagpole. Surrounded by guards, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four men were led to an elevator, descended a score of</seg><seg type="columnLine">floors, and entered the Euthanasia Chambers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The furnishings and appointments here were the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">word in beauty and luxury. The soft carpets, the rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">hangings, the luxurious furniture, the flowers and scents</seg><seg type="columnLine">and colors, the foods and wines within reach, all had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendency to lull the occupants into a sense of peace and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowsy comfort. Each of the party was led to a room</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he was to be given twenty-four hours for receiving</seg><seg type="columnLine">last visits from friends and relatives. Jack and Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">elected to remain together in one room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lovely, isn't it," said Quentin ironically. "A year</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago its beauty would have stirred my emotions. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">your rugged land has cured me. Now I can see the steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and concrete through the velvet, and see it just as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">MECHANOCRACY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">undertaking establishment which you enter alive and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sentier arrived presently. Without his squad of</seg><seg type="columnLine">policemen he was not a very impressive man. He almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">wept as he greeted Quentin. It looked almost as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he were the one sentenced to death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One's duty demands cruel things," he moaned. "Ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest your best friend!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wouldn't do it, that's all," Jack exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ouentin patted the boy's back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes you would," he reminded, "if you and a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">generations of you had been raised like machines to obey</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Government Machine and be loyal to it above all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Noting Sender's depressed looks, Quentin offered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">relate his adventures in Democratia, and Sentier eagerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped at the opportunity to relieve the tension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get a permit to broadcast as much as possible of it,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin suggested. "It is a beautiful land and a wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful people that are about to be destroyed. But, suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tell you? What if you sympathize? That will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">treason, and you will be--eliminated."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sentier smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No danger," he said. "That is why you were sent out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I am a police captain.

A frown gathered on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead. He glared at the policeman, who was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">embodiment of the Government that killed an efficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">man for doing his duty, and to whom machines were</seg><seg type="columnLine">more important than men. Quentin watched the boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he talked. Vague possibilities stirred his imagination.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What if he might see Martha again? He, Quentin, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brains for a daring attempt, but not the physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage. Jack had boldness enough for anything. Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin worded his story quite as much for its effect on Jack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as for Sentier's benefit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">" X UST a year ago," Quentin began his story to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I Sentier, "I was called into that same office in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Washington and given my instructions. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered the chance to refuse without stigma. That I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought ridiculous, for it seemed a wonderful oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity. I am cursed with a love of adventure, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a terrible affliction in this monotonous age. I was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spend a year in Democratia, and then come back and give</seg><seg type="columnLine">a full report on the life and customs of the country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was so excited that I came within a hair of giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">away a secret, and probably with it, my life or liberty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This love of adventure had boiled up within me from</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth. For years I had planned some sort of a wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed. Bit by bit I had secretly assembled an airplane</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an obscure cellar on Long Island. It lay there at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, with fuel and provisions ready to start,</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipped for a rough, uncertain trip, instead of for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheduled routes which have been carefully standardized.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had an impulse to take this plane for the trip, but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash of judgment told me that it would be dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reveal my secret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was ordered to take my official plans, which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">owned according to my rank and standing. I was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted to take my own mechanic; Binder and Steele</seg><seg type="columnLine">were assigned as mechanics and Neatman as Secretary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was all very simple. The three men arrived at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">home early one morning; we taxied out of my garage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew across the city, and out over the Atlantic.

Only when we reached the Himalayas I</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to feel my first thrill. Those vast stretches, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a city for hundreds of miles, are romantic. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">located the Tagnapo River and the ruins of Llhasa.</seg><seg type="columnLine">once a large and powerful city; and struck due North</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a wild desert where no one ever goes. After some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours of searching, we located the green valley completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut in by vast mountains and saw the cities of Demo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cratia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There were three large fine ones and a dozen smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">towns, and a sprinkling over the whole land of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been villages. Think of it, Sentier, they live</seg><seg type="columnLine">in villages! Little collections of a few tiny buildings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Most of the world used to do that a thousand, years ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And even the three great cities of Democratia were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern as our cities are. They were not built in units.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each building was of different height and size, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had open streets in single layers. But it was a wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking land. Think of it, lying hidden away there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the world knowing nothing about it; its bold, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sourceful men, its sturdy and beautiful women. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is puffed out, no one will feel a pang of sympathy for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There were no diplomatic relations between the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">governments. Credentials were of no use to me, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">received none, nor did I receive any sign of the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">string of rules, instructions, and minutiae. The whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was left up to me; and during the whole of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip over, I pondered on some way of approaching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people of Democratia. I pondered in vain. I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing about the people and their country, and could</seg><seg type="columnLine">form no plan. So, I first took a good look at the coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try from an altitude too great for tjiem to see me. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I decided to land in some uninhabited spot and spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">a night resting and planning. I chose a flat place low</seg><seg type="columnLine">down between two tall peaks, near the northern rim of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountain-surrounded country. A hundred miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">away was one of their largest cities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We alighted on grass and the air was cold. But we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had warm clothing and the cabin of the plane was heated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The beauty of the prospect was worth the cold. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast, grassy plain, the woods half a mile away, the huge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow-patched mountains in the opposite direction--we</seg><seg type="columnLine">live too much cooped up in cities, Sentier--it took my</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath. The others were also impressed, and we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to expend our emotions in a walk toward the woods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I ought to have known better. City men have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">business in the wilderness. Oh, yes, we took our shock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods along, and I took an old-fashioned projectile pistol.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Half way to the trees we heard a tramping behind us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turning, beheld a huge goat with winding horns</seg><seg type="columnLine">charging for us at full speed. The animal raced swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward us as we stood paralyzed by fear. It seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have picked out Steele, and tore right at him. Steele</seg><seg type="columnLine">10</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">took it coolly enough, and faced the charge with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock-rod. It paralyzed the goat on contact all right, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it could not stop the momentum of the great, charging</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, which rolled crashing on, crushed Steele under</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and nearly got me. I got a bullet in the goat's head</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it could get up, astonishing my companions with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the noise of the shot. Steele was dead, smashed, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we reached him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The sound of galloping hoofs reached us. More</seg><seg type="columnLine">goats were coming. We ran for the woods because</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were nearer than our plane. Later I got used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the looks of these goats. They are not particularly dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerous. But to us, just then, they were huge, frightful</seg><seg type="columnLine">monsters. We're not used to seeing large, live, free</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals. Our frantic fear made us act foolishly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At intervals I turned around and shot bullets at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">goats. Just now that is laughable. I had no skill with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weapon. My shots went wild. But it helped a lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle, for the noise confused the goats and retarded their</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed somewhat. We reached the trees and hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">far into their depths. The goats did not follow, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">their horns got tangled in the growth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then, when we had gotten our breath after such</seg><seg type="columnLine">unaccustomed exertion, and had waited long enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give the goats time to wander off, we started back. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked on through the trees toward the plain, but came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to no end of them. We were lost!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The terrors of that night will be stamped on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory forever--well, that won't be long. First of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was cold. We huddled together. Some of us thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a fire. None of us had ever seen an open fire; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had read of ancient savages making fires by rub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing sticks. We rubbed sticks till we were exhausted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course it was silly, for we didn't even know the dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference between green and dry wood. We therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded together on the ground, shivering as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">with terror as with cold. There was no sleep for us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The noises of the woods, from clicks and crackles to</seg><seg type="columnLine">roars and yells, sent grip after grip of fear through our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearts. Sentier, these tales you read of people dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">from pure terror are not true. If such a thing were</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible, we would all have died the first quarter of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. Yet, these Democratians spend night after night</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the woods and enjoy it. We are just too much pann</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered by our machines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A party of them had camped, not half a mile from us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night, just too far for us to see their fire. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrap, themselves in blankets and leave one person on</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard, and sleep soundly all night. They found us in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning, numb with cold and dumb with fear. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first I knew of them was a musical voice calling:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Quick, Jack!' with a little O/j-like intake of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath. 'Someone in distress!'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I looked up. Approathing was a girl in corduroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeches and high-laced boots--antiquated, romantic. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">"knapsack. An old-fashioned rifle for shooting bullets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But there was a glow of health in her cheeks that made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chemical beauty of our girls seem ridiculous. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, that moment, shivering in hungry, hopeless despair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was the most beautiful, radiant being I had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen or imagined. She was the sister of Jack here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was with her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OUENTIN looked about the velvet draperies that</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealed their prison walls, as though it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to believe that it all hung together somehow. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sank his face in his hands for an instant. Sentier was</seg><seg type="columnLine">embarrassed. Sentier could sympathize with the love</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair. Men of his day were experts in those. Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not even look at Jack, and in a moment had thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the mood, and continued:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They had us comfortable in a few minutes. Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his father came up very soon. Before our eyes they</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a fire. Sentier, you ought to see a fire before</seg><seg type="columnLine">you die. They boiled coffee and eggs. Did you ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat an egg, Sentier? The delicious odors, the warmth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fire, the beauty of the girl who was on an equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the men in strength and efficiency, and had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">simpering feminine wiles about her--I was sold on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Democratia from then on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Who are you, and whence are you?' was their first</seg><seg type="columnLine">question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'Just on a pleasure cruise,' I put in quickly before</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of the rest of our party could speak.

After some sleep and rest I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to notice things. There were a dozen people in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny house of logs on the mountain. They were living</seg><seg type="columnLine">there for a month. They had no heating system. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighting system--depended on open fires. No kine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone service. No tube delivery. Not even properly</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared food. They ate just animals and plants boiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a fire. No transportation ; they walked everywhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet they were enjoying it. Doing it for pleasure! Can</seg><seg type="columnLine">you imagine it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And can you imagine me enjoying it? I got inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested early. I learned to build a fire. Too bad there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">no place around here to build a fire. I learned to shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rifle. Much more thrilling than a shock-rod. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the month I could walk ten miles and enjoy it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I cou'.d sleep out all night and make my own breakfast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Compared with these people, though, Sentier, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless.

Without its care we would die in a few days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These people haven't much government: a ridiculous</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting of so-called representatives once a year, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">spends most of its time arguing and never gets any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where. They have 'laws' which they obey when it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">convenient and possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But they don't need a government. We do. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">can take care of themselves.

Jack here</seg><seg type="columnLine">is only eighteen, but he could probably take you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">break you up in short pieces. Don't grab your rod.

Jack's father was a high govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment official and had been vacationing in the mountains.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a rugged and kindly man, very much concerned</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the welfare of the people over whom his authority</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended. He took us to his home and shared its com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forts with us. Imagine that, Sentier!

For, much as I liked</seg><seg type="columnLine">their country and their ways, I knew that the Govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment Machine would not.

I learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">about money and buying and political parties, about poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">people and unemployment. I learned to drive one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their little cars. I actually held a 'job' and made my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">living for a few weeks, though I think my employer</seg><seg type="columnLine">was glad to get rid of me.

Martha and I never suspected any</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger, when we were climbing up the easy ice-slopes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a frolicking fashion.

As</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beast pummeled me, I scrambled for the long hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-knife which I had learned to wear at my belt as do</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of these people out in the open.

She held up her arm to protect it from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal's long claws, and this interfered with her knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrusts.

As</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin stared amazed, Jack gave Sentier a shove; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter rolled down on the floor and flopped over on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in a loose, sickening sort of way. His face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple, his black tongue protruded, and there were black</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks on his neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Neat job," Jack said, "if you're really as surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you look. You went too far, reminding me of Sis</seg><seg type="columnLine">and home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UENTIN looked down at the dead man, and up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Jack's stalwart figure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Democracy versus mechanocracy," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That is the way it goes between individuals. Between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the organized groups, it would come out exactly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The machine wins, though its subject people are weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lings. Wouldn't it be better for the race to destroy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I couldn't do it. Every fiber of my nature has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been brought up to consider the Government Machine as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sacred mother--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, I'll bet Jack would have the nerve in a minute--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come," whispered Jack shrilly, "let's get out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was already stripping off the dead man's uniform.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He held it up and surveyed it ruefully against his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">strapping bulk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll put it on," Quentin said. "I- can act the part</seg><seg type="columnLine">where you cannot. It'll be your turn when the rough-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house begins."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin's clothes were put on the dead man, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter's keys were used to open the door. They walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the sentry at the door, receiving his salute without</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flutter of an eyelid, and marched down the hallway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack in front with the handcuffs on, but not locked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin came behind him in the captain's uniform, bear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the shock-rod. They had no plan, except that Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin suddenly thought of his secret airplane, and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined to get to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But how? It was out on Long Island. They were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle of a huge city, one solid structure honey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">combed with mazes and labyrinths of streets and pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sages horizontal and vertical. The end of it was three</seg><seg type="columnLine">or four miles away, three or four miles of endless, buz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zing, swarming, whirling machinery and humanity be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween them and open country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our best bet," Quentin said, "is to get down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowest level. There we ought to find some sort of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">burrow to crawl out of. To the elevator."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They reached the elevator and pushed its button. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">door opened and they stepped in, setting the button on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "eight-below" level, the lowest of them all. The car</seg><seg type="columnLine">started down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A gong clanged and kept on clanging somewhere in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the depths of the building. A loud speaker began to bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low hoarsely on the floor they were passing; its roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">died down as they left the floor behind, but was taken up</seg><seg type="columnLine">by another on the floor below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The guard has found Sentier," whispered Quentin,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "and has turned in the alarm. Well, let's show 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">•a scrap!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A new voice began in the speaker. It was crisp and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave orders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "-all doors," they heard as they shot past a floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "-shut off the power and search all elevators-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hra!" said Quentin as the elevator slowed down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw through the bars a group of blue uniforms</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching. Jack was tense for a fighc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not yet!" Quentin warned him. "Remember we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't fight the organization."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right!" he shouted to the approaching policemen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've got one of them. One of you come along. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the power back on quick and the elevator moving, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I can hustle him back where he belongs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The policemen saluted Quentin. One of them stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in and glared at Jack. The elevator door closed. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few moments the car shot upward again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin touched the policeman with the shock-rod, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he lay limp, Jack put the handcuffs on him, tied his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet with a strap from the policeman's own puttees, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gagged him with a handkerchief. The policeman, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed to such rough handling, winced and shrank</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, groaning. The elevator shot upward swiftly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing floors by dozens and scores. The Euthanasia</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chambers were left far below. On each floor were</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowding people, clanging gongs, and bellowing speakers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eventually they stopped. Outside was huge machinery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels, pulleys, motors. Above was the sky wavy glass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somewhere, far away below, were footsteps pounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">up metal stairs. They were just under the roof, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet above the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up on my shoulders!" said Jack, glancing up at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skylight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin unhooked the skylight, climbed out, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped Jack up after him. All about them was a sea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">roofs, miles and miles of them, flat dirty, with little</seg><seg type="columnLine">cubicles and penthouses scattered by the hundreds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventilators by the thousands. Above them on its tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">flagpole waved the black streamer, which undoubtedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked the location of the Euthanasia Chambers as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">guide for aircraft. There were other flagpoles and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">streamers, but no more black ones. They ran. They ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">at random, not knowing whither.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They ran till their breath was all gone, and then sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">MECHANOCRACY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">down and lay flat. Jack still trembled at the sensation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of having crossed a bridgeway between two buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">and glimpsed a street a thousand feet below, a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream of blended, moving masses. Just now there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one in sight. The scene was no different than when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had started. Only the absence of the black streamer</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him sure that they were in a different place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bad fix," Quentin said. "We'll starve up here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, no," Jack replied easily. "We'll depend on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun for direction, and keep going till we find an end or</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge. We'll find some way of getting to the ground and</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you've got nerve, anyway. And it's better to</seg><seg type="columnLine">die trying than to sit here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they noted airplanes searching round and round</seg><seg type="columnLine">above them. They crouched down in the shadows be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the pipes and cubicles. The planes came lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">and closer together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They got the planes out quick," Jack observed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It did, you mean. It's all automatic. The men are</seg><seg type="columnLine">just tools. The whole city is an electrical brain, and is</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a subsidiary of the Washington brain; a sort of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferior ganglion. The men could never think nor work</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fast. The planes are now coming straight at us;</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently they have located us by some such methods as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the refractograph, which by the refraction of light de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tects the column of carbon dioxide rising from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs, the telaud which can hear us whisper or our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearts beat, or the holograph which locates us by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat of our bodies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A plane landed on a level place a hundred yards away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another and another alighted beside it. Figures poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and began to close in on the two fugitives. Ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them was the edge of the building, with a sheer verti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal drop of a thousand feet. There was no bridgeway,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">110	door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ha!" Quentin pointed to a flagpole from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated a long silver streamer. It was some sort of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">commercial signal to aircraft. The halliards on which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flag hung extended down over the edge of the roof.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Those ropes run into a window below."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Figures in blue were running toward them. Jack slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the rope first and disappeared. Quentin waited for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rope to loosen as Jack got off, uncertain as to whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would hold their combined weight. But he found a</seg><seg type="columnLine">policeman sliding down the rope after him. The police-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man hung on tightly and moved gingerly; Quentin looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and saw his face ashy pale as it looked down at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the two of them swung out in space over a canyon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand feet deep, at the bottom of which moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow streams of men and machines. A blended murmur</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up to the two tiny men dangling high up there on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The policeman was poking downward toward Ouentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his shock-rod. Other faces were looking down over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the roof, tense and distorted. Jack shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">from below, some incoherent, encouraging thing. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">policeman slid down faster to catch Quentin. Ouentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">jabbed viciously upwards with his shock-rod and felt it</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch. The policeman went limp and seemed to float</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into space. His blue body sprawled out and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and over as it fell. With deadly rapidity it grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller and contracted to a dot far down in the gloom</seg><seg type="columnLine">below. Ouentin felt himself drawn into the window and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembled as he sat down for an instant on the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tack was dragging him toward a door. He could see</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the flag halliards tightening as another man started</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. Out in the corridor they found gongs ringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and speakers bellowing, but no people. On all sides there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a roar and clatter of machinery behind closed doors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They opened one and dashed into a huge room full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">big machines in rows; steam sizzled and white linen</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed by. At the far end, from every machine in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long row came baskets piled high with clean laundry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scudded along roller conveyors into openings in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. People were visible. The baskets of laundry dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearing into dark openings gave Quentin an idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on!" shouted Quentin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They ran across the room. Each seized one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">baskets, dumped the linen on the floor, set the basket</seg><seg type="columnLine">back on the roller conveyor, and got into it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The darkness of the pit closed upon them. Machinery</seg><seg type="columnLine">clattered and steam hissed. They bent low, not knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was above them. They felt themselves sink rapid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly and again tipped level; there were gears grinding as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they rounded corners. There seemed no end of sinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and down in the blackness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, after a clatter of paper there came a burst of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. They saw clothes dumped out of baskets, wrapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in paper, and shot into tubes, all by machinery. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped out on the floor. Again there were no people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No bawling speakers. No gongs. Only the open mouths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pneumatic tubes, an endless row of them, each marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its destination. Quentin eagerly looked for Brook-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lyn. It took but a moment to find it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All aboard for Long Island!" he shouted in glee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a wrapped package came down the conveyor to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the Brooklyn tube, he rolled it off and they took its</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. The lid popped shut on the tube, nearly rupturing</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ear-drums, and they were plunged in darkness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After the first rush and swirl and roar, all was quiet for</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again there was a roar and a crash and a burst of day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. The two fugitives jumped up and ran, knocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">over several astonished people who were waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">packages; their destination was an open door with day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light beyond. Out there was a row of trucks with</seg><seg type="columnLine">laundry packages dropping into them from overhead</seg><seg type="columnLine">chutes. They were automatic trucks such as are used</seg><seg type="columnLine">for making deliveries beyond the pneumatic-tube zone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They leaped into the foremost truck. Quentin set</seg><seg type="columnLine">the switches on impulse for Bay Shore, because that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not where he wanted to go, and they both rolled back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the closed portion of the vehicle. The truck started</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, gathered momentum, and automatically made its</seg><seg type="columnLine">way out of the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After fifteen minutes of eternity, they looked out. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">truck was moving swiftly along a country road. Twi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light was gathering rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'd better jump out and let it go on," Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested. "It's clever and powerful."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is?" asked Jack, "the Police Department?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Machine. The Government Machine in Wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington and its subsidiary portion in New York. It's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big brain. The police are dumb tools."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They waited for the truck to slow up around a curve,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and jumped out. They alighted on grass. Jack rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and jumped up. Quentin found his breath gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his head dizzy. He crawled unsteadily into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter of some shrubbery. In a few minutes a half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen speed-cycles on the road and planes in the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">whizzed by, in pursuit of the laundry car.</seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "See how quickly it works," Quentin said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's uncanny to hear you talk about it!" Jack ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed. "It's inhuman!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Next it will be flares and spotlights," Quentin warned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin found walking difficult and felt a terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">headache. He must have gotten a crack on the head when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fell out of the truck. Jack supported him and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered on. Ten miles ahead was tl "-'r destination,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his little country bungalow with its secret cellar. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was familiar terrain for Quentin, but ten miles cross-</seg><seg type="columnLine">country in the darkness was none the less difficult. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossing a road would be dangerous. As they stumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">across field and through brush and timber, Quentin felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself growing weaker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not long before the lights appeared. Ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, to the right, the country was lighted as bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">as day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're headed wrong," Quentin chuckled as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered desperately along. "We're going to the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">at right angles to them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Quentin did not recollect the rest of the night very</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly. Jack's strong shoulders were a comfort without</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he could not have gone a mile. His head cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">up now and then in flashes to answer Jack's questions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again he would relapse into a half-comatose state</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which he walked. The guiding of the way depended</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No rest from the Machine," went round and round</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his head. "On all sides of us, thousands, millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentacles are squirming to close in on us, day and night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soon my buzzing brain will give out. Then the Machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">will reach out and pick us up. The Machine ought to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed-!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But that is treason," leaped through his brain in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden shock. "How do I dare even think such treason?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Because my head sings from the bump it got, I suppose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But suppose Jack thought that. That would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">treason. And Jack has physical courage to do things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even to destroy the machine. It would be easy to do:</seg><seg type="columnLine">just that one square building. Wreck that, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government Machine is dead. Jack would dare it if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I can't make myself tell him. It is treason.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even to think it is treason. Why can't he see it himself ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I keep giving him hints-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack kept continuously interrupting him with ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How can they make it so much like daylight over</seg><seg type="columnLine">there ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin hoped in a dazed way that his explanation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the thousand-foot flare circles that eliminated shadows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was correct. Then again he trudged on in his sleep, till</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was roused by Jack's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do we get across?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came wide awake for a moment. In front was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-foot wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Long Island Transformer Depot. We'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go around. To the left. That was a bad crack on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. I've got to rest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Jack had to lift him and drag him a few feet before</seg><seg type="columnLine">his legs got to swinging again. Then again came Jack's</seg><seg type="columnLine">demand for a key.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Got to move," Jack said. "The lights are starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">this way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Here we are!" Quentin shouted as he came to again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He unlocked the door to the little bungalow. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">found themselves in a small hallway from which steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">led down to the spacious underground shop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack gasped in amazement at it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I understood you to say," he exclaimed, "that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">did this secretly and alone. W?hy, digging this cave</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take years of time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin was nodding drowsily again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Power is cheap," he said. "See there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a heap of cartridge-like things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I dug out this place with those. Screw a red one to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue one and drop them. It is a slow explosion. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise. But in a few moments everything, iron, rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything is a loose, fluffy powder. I swept it out. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now I've got to sleep. My head hurts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OUENTIN awoke to the humming of smooth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-adjusted machinery. Bright sunlight shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">full upon him. He lay and rested, and was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious of a headache. There was a painful lump on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his occiput. He studied the strange place about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally he realized that it was the cabin of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret plane. He sat up. Down below was blue water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to the left a beautiful \a.cy shore and blue mountains.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In front of him was Jack, peering ahead. As Jack heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stir behind him, he sat up; his face lighted up to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin awake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are we?" Quentin asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm no geographer," Jack said, "but it must be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mediterranean."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See!" continued the boy. "We got away from 'em ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or from It, as you say." He grinned as though on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">schoolboy lark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin shook his head gloomily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're not out of it yet. Sooner or later it will get</seg><seg type="columnLine">us-- anywhere on this earth. My big hope is that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might see Martha first."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat, sunk in gloomy thoughts. Jack grinned hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pily. He seemed to be a creature that responded to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy stimuli of the present, and forgot that there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You need some breakfast, sir," he said. "Then, you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel better."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin ate and then lay down and slept again. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">he awoke, he spent many hours searching the sky around</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and the fleeting ground below. It was acute tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture to feel that every moment a swarm of planes would</seg><seg type="columnLine">swoop down on them. Every dot in the blue caused him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to peer intently and with beating heart and clutching</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, v. »iil it was passed by safely. But it began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look hopeful as they passed over Asia Minor and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">India, without any sign of pursuit or interference. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted pleasant thoughts of Martha to flow through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above northern India he became alert. Eagerly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the Himalayas fall behind. The machine needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">only an occasional touch for guidance. A shout from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack called his attention to the green levels of Demo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cratia. Slowly its woods and mountains separated them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves from the blue haze. Then they crossed its edge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They headed toward the capital.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin's heart pounded. He was now confident that</seg><seg type="columnLine">no matter what happened eventually, he would see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martha first. Up to the present time he had been racked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with uncertainty. Her image rose up before his eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">MECHANOCRACY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and his veins tingled and his breath came short with an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticipation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The radio of Quentin's plane could not tune in with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inferior ones of Democratia; none of his messages</seg><seg type="columnLine">got through. Therefore, no one awaited them at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing-field. But, after telephoning and driving in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">car, they were eventually at the house of Jack's father,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Quentin and Martha were in each other's arms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And after that, the four of them were gravely discuss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is no hope," Quentin said. "The Government</seg><seg type="columnLine">considers that it owns the Earth. It has pronounced</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentence and nothing on earth can prevent its being car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you suppose they will do it?" asked Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin's host; "Explosives?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hardly explosives," considered Quentin. "Gas prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably. Gas bombs from planes. Electric charges and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disease bacilli are possible, but the one is unnecessarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">expensive and the other unnecessarily brutal. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government Machine is inexorable; but it will do noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing unnecessary. It is hard for you to realize the abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely perfect, impersonal logic of the Machine. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess is gas, some swift, painless gas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps," Jack said, "they will shout us to death</seg><seg type="columnLine">with those shriekers they had on all their floors."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now, Jack!" Martha protested, in tears. She clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Quentin. "But it's just like you, being silly, even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of death."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What I ought to do," Jack bantered, swelling up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">biceps, "is to punch the face of death right in the nose."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack loved his sister and was doing his best to cheer her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lip in his clumsy way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they discussed whether or not an alarm ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be spread among the people of Democratia. Quentin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">host was in a responsible government position and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">authority to decide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What would be the use?" Quentin asked. "No de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fense is possible. No escape is possible. There would</seg><seg type="columnLine">only be panic and riots and needless suffering. It is most</seg><seg type="columnLine">merciful to let it come as a complete surprise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll carry the burden, then."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin and Martha spent most of the day clinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">close together. There was no sleep for them nor for her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">father that night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Isn't it terrible!" Martha exclaimed, "to see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">young animal, Jack, sleep soundly in spite of all this?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hasn't he any feelings ? We may never see the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">light again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But morning dawned bright and clear upon the smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">land. It was torture to the three people who anxiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">scanned the sky. Jack went out to play golf and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of the nation went about its business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the middle of the forenoon four planes appeared</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">111	the southern sky. Shortly afterwards Jack came in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">much interested in them, but showing no fear. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly a primitive creature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The planes came straight toward the city, and the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchers prepared to die; and bade goodbye to each other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and to Jack, who by this time had grown serious and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked worried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin was almost breathless when the planes set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled hesitatingly on the landing-field. An emergency</seg><seg type="columnLine">car hurried him and his companion out there. There,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a circle between the four planes, were a dozen people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of whom Quentin recognized as prominent figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">in New York life. But they looked pale and crushed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they looked about furtively and helplessly. Despair</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed in their attitudes and in their silence. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">livened up a little when they saw Quentin approaching.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked at them in amazement and waited for them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1 "We've come to ask for help," one of them said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Will you help us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again Quentin could not find words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The world is in chaos," the man said. "Disorder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Starvation. Disease. People are dying by millions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trampling, exposure, suicide--no one knows tvhat to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What in the world has happened ?" Quentin man&amp;ged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to gasp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An explosion," the man answered. "The key parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Government Machine are totally destroyed. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">one knows how to repair it. The world is disorganized."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin stared blankly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We thought perhaps you h$d done it," the man con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued. "We knew of your daring escape-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin silently shook his head. Then he got a sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jack!" he said sharply, turning toward that young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. "You rascal-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack sheepishly came out from behind his sister.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you know about this ?" Quentin demanded..</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," Jack stammered. "You were so positive that</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhuman thing would catch us sooner or later--I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to take any chances.

Then I lit out, straight up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air. There were too many planes around-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rest was smothered in his sister's hug. His father</seg><seg type="columnLine">had an arm about his shoulders.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face lost its hateful, threatening lines and as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed what he meant to be an expression of</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly good nature. Pryor's eyes saw only a fatuous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">egotistical leer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aw, don't get sore, Mr. Pryor," the visitor whined.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I was only fooling. I didn't mean no offense. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing has got my goat. Can't help being jumpy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick on the trigger.

"You're a kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a puzzle yourself, Mr. Pryor," he remarked. "Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have a chance to make a lot of jack and you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to spend your time working conundrums.

With</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, investigating crime is not a vocation, but a recre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation. If I can't enjoy it, I intend to keep scrupulously</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from it. Suppose you tell me your story as con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cisely as possible.

I may as well tell you that I am a</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon keeper."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A saloon keeper?" Pryor doubted. "I suppose you</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean that you operate a speakeasy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Saloon is the right word for it. My business is</seg><seg type="columnLine">strictly legal and legitimate. You see, it is located in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elsonado, just across the border in Old Mexico.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"That will give you a line on the whole works. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course you remember the Whipple case.

Please</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">enlighten me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Whipple was a typical tourist. Came to California</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from Iowa. Brought his daughter along. She was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">supposed to be seventeen. I think that was a lie, myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">To me she looked old enough to vote."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You saw her then ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Sure I did. She was hanging around my saloon for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nearly an hour. Didn't drink anything but soda pop,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">though. Funny, ain't it, about these Eastern tourists?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Back in Iowa they wouldn't think of going near a place</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">where folks was drinking liquor. They wouldn't even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">play penny ante for money. But when they come out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">here on a vacation they get a big kick out of going</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into a real saloon, putting their feet on the brass rail,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and risking their quarters in the slot machines."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That's understandable," Pryor interposed. "And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what happened to the Whipple girl ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"She got separated from her old man. Some say she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ditched him on purpose. Others claim that somebody</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">put knock-out drops in her soda pop. Take your choice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What is your version of the incident, Mr. Strick-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">land?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I don't pretend to know nothing about it. I'm just</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">telling you what the papers said. Whipple hunted his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">daughter Ruth all over Elsonado. He didn't find her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">until two days later. You can easily imagine what she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">looked like and the story she told the old man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes," Pryor agreed. "That I can easily imagine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And after that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Whipple took Ruth to Los Angeles. He was either</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">screvvey or else he had a funny twist in his make-up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You remember what he done, don't you? He rented an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">apartment. Next day they found Whipple and his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">daughter dead in the room with the gas turned on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">From the position of the bodies it looked like the girl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knew what was going to happen and lay down on the bed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of her own free will. A note was found signed by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Whipple. It said that he couldn't stand the disgrace</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and that he had decided to end it all. That's what started</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the big buzz in the newspapers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I see. And by 'big buzz' I suppose you mean that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there was an investigation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'll say there was an investigation. A couple of guys</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that had it in for me squealed to the reporters. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">claimed that I engineered the whole rotten mess. Two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">guys that worked for me and three that were connected</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a joint three blocks away from my place were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">accused of doing all the dirty work. The newspapers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sure made the most of it. They tried to get the police</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Elsonado to pinch us, but the bulls knew better than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to do that. Then the story went out that I had the police</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fixed. Finally somebody brought pressure to bear</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through Washington and the six of us was indicted. We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was tried but the jury acquitted us in short order, of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"As I remember it," Pryor interposed, "the acquittal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was due partly to the fact that the leading witness for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the prosecution failed to appear at the trial. A few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weeks later the reason for his absence was made clear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">His body was found out in the desert, riddled with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bullets. How do you account for that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You seem to know something about the Whipple</seg><seg type="columnLine">case after all," Strickland grinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"About that part of it, yes. It is incidents like that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which interest me most. No doubt you can explain why</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this witness was killed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I don't know nothing about it personally, if that's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what you are driving at. He just got what often hap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pens to a guy that don't know enough to keep his mouth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shut."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I see. And after the trial and acquittal--what hap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pened then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Nothing happened for several nion'hs. Then Torrez</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was killed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Torrez? He was the proprietor of that other estab-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lishment you referred to, was he not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yep. He ran the dive where the Whipple girl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">finally landed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How was he killed?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The coroner said he died by sunstroke. But I hap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pen to know that he was poisoned."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What makes you think that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Because every one of the guys that was mixed tip in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the case except me died the same way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Of sunstroke, you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Of what the coroner called sunstroke."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But isn't it possible that they all did die of sun-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stroke ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Maybe it is possible. But it sure looked phoney to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me. I'll leave it to you. You've been in California for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">several years, haven't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Twelve years, to be exact."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"All right. And during those twelve years how many</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">times have you heard about anybody dying in California</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of sunstroke?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Now that you mention it, I can't remember a single</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">case of sunstroke that resulted fatally."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Neither could anybody else--until four of these birds</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was killed in a row--one right after the other. And the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">funny part of it was that on the days they died, the sun</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wasn't especially strong either. Doesn't that sound</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fishy to you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It does look like a mystery. I understood you to say</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that these five men were all closely associated with each</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other. That suggests a contagion of some sort. Perhaps</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it was some rare disease which was not understood by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the coroners who officiated at the inquest, and which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was transmitted from one of these men to the others."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I thought of that, too. But it don't hold water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You see it happens that, excepting for one guy named</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Marvido, the others wasn't within a hundred miles of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Torres or of each other for at least two months before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they died. On the other hand there was hundreds of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other people who came in close contact with these men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">every day and none of them died of sunstroke or any-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing else. How would you explain that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I'm not trying to explain anything yet. I'm merely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seeking information," Pryor told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well, I guess you got most of the dope now. Any-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing else you want to know?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I suppose I may as well ask a few conventional</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">questions--the kind a professional detective would ask</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">under the circumstances."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"O. K. Shoot!" .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">/'Assuming that these five men were poisoned, have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you any reason to suspect any particular individual of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">administering the poison?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I don't quite get you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Let me put it this way: Do you know of anyone who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would be impelled to avenge the death of the Whipples?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">20</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess there were thousands of people that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sore about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Naturally. Almost any upright person would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">righteously indignant under the circumstances. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is hard to believe that such a person would go to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent of committing murder unless he happened to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">relative or close friend of the wronged girl. Murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a pretty risky business. Do you know of anyone who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be likely to take that risk ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damned if I do. So far as I know, the Whipples</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't have any relatives or close friends in California."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I see. And about the localities of these five deaths--</seg><seg type="columnLine">did they all happen in the same place?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. They happened in five different places.

And I presume that -your interest in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">case is due to the fact that these five men were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends of yours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hell no. Except for Torrez, they were just a bunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bums. Two of them worked for me.

Glad that's settled. Now how much dough</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you want in advance ?" Strickland took out his check</seg><seg type="columnLine">book, unscrewed the cap of his fountain pen and waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Pryor to name a retainer fee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind the money question, now, Mr. Strick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land," Pryor told him. "I won't be able to start on your</seg><seg type="columnLine">case for several days anyway. I'm right in the midst of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a problem now and I make it a rule never to start on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new puzzle until I have solved the one on hand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Hell you say," Strickland swore. "Don't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize that this is a matter of life and death? While</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're waiting for you to work out your riddles, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">guy may croak me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you follow my instructions, I don't think you need</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fear anything of that sort. The history of crime in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicates that after a criminal has succeeded in accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plishing his purpose once, he almost invariably uses</seg><seg type="columnLine">identically the same method in carrying out subsequent</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimes. Scotland Yard has built up a complete sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem of crime detection based on this well-established</seg><seg type="columnLine">principle. They call it the "M. O. System" which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">an abbreviation for "modus operandi." From what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have told me, there can be little doubt that, if this sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed murderer attempts to do away with you, he will</seg><seg type="columnLine">use sunlight as his chief weapon. It ought to be pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible for you to protect yourself, by avoiding the direct</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays of the sun. I suggest that you wear black gloves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on your hands and that you shade your face and neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a broad brimmed hat. Under no circumstances</seg><seg type="columnLine">must you expose any part of your skin to direct sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. Do you understand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure. That sounds like good advice. I believe I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it. And when will you be able to start work trailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the killer?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's hard to say. It all depends on the progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">I make on my present task. It may be a few hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it may be weeks. However, I have reason to hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I shall find the solution within the next few days.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As soon as that happens, I shall get in touch with you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Please leave your phone number with my secretary as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you pass out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg><seg type="columnLine">An Ominous Warning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON the following morning Pryor's office saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">not. He was out visiting garages, talking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">service station attendants and interviewing car</seg><seg type="columnLine">owners in an endeavor to ascertain the reasons why the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sale of a certain brand of automobile polish had fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">off at a rate that had seriously alarmed its manufac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When, at about four-thirty in the afternoon, he fi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nally made his appearance, his secretary, Miss Field,</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted him with, "Mr. Strickland has been trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get you all day. When I told him I didn't expect you in</seg><seg type="columnLine">until late he became quite frantic. He asked me to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure and have you phone him the moment you arrived.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shall I call him now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," the Master of Mystery said bluntly. "He has</seg><seg type="columnLine">no business to take up my time now.

I guess you're not worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">over what happens to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To be brutally frank, I don't see why I should worry</seg><seg type="columnLine">about you, Mr. Strickland.

And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung up the phone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half an hour later, when he was just about to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">his office, the telephone rang again.

This I tried to explain to Strickland, but he refused</seg><seg type="columnLine">to listen. I advised him to get in touch with you. Ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently he took my suggestion.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter was postmarked Elsonado. It was mailed 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">December 24. There were thousands of visitors in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elsonado that day so it would be like hunting for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">needle in a haystack to try to find out who mailed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter. It looks like a blind. If the man who wrote it</seg><seg type="columnLine">really intends to carry out his threat he must be in Los</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angeles right now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How about the paper and envelope?"

I wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">advise you to do that, though. It looks as if the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who sent the letter planned it very carefully so that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence would be destroyed. If that's the case, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">likelihood is that he has thought of the common methods</seg><seg type="columnLine">of handling paper like that and has provided for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">probable contingencies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That's what I'm afraid of myself.

If you find that the water treatment works</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right with the small fragment you will still be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use the same process on the rest of the message."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That sounds like good advice.

As was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case with every problem he had ever tackled, suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess crowned his efforts. With an overwhelming weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of evidence he proved that the substantial decrease in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the demand for Crystalac was due to an unpleasant odor</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the product acquired after it had been exposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the air for some time. Numerous experiments had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown that the smell had no effect on the polishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">properties of the product but it was sufficient to make it</seg><seg type="columnLine">undesirable to a large number of users who were other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise very well satisfied with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Pryor solved the problem with characteristic speed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">simplicity. He recommended adding to the formula an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingredient having an agreeable odor powerful enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover up the unpleasant smell. A hundred samples</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the altered product distributed to men and women</seg><seg type="columnLine">of various types demonstrated that it was entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">acceptable to the public in its new form. This work</seg><seg type="columnLine">he completed on the afternoon of December 31. The fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing day being a holiday, he waited until the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of January 2, and then, true to his promise, he in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed his girl to call Strickland's telephone number.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a considerable delay before she signaled her</seg><seg type="columnLine">employer to lift his phone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good morning, Mr. Strickland," was Pryor's greet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "This is not Mr. Strickland," the voice at the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the line said. "This is his butler speaking. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strickland is not able to come to the telephone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A strange premonition prompted Pryor to say, "Has</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything happened to Mr. Strickland--anything serious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Sir. Something has happened to him. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing serious. Something egregiously serious."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Don't tell me he is--" He stopped with his sentence</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging in midair when he heard, as if in the distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an excited voice say, "Give me that phone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A moment later this second voice was talking direct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly into the transmitter.

"You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are there to investigate the death of James Strickland."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How the devil did you know that?

Why ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Strickland was found dead in his own bathroom early</seg><seg type="columnLine">this morning. Now how in the devil could a man die</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sunstroke inside of a house in California, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second of January, when it is cold and foggy outside?</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's a puzzle for you to answer, Mr. Pryor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That does sound like a poser, doesn't it? Neverthe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, I shall be very much surprised if it doesn't trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pire that the circumstances attending his death were</seg><seg type="columnLine">identical with those of a person who has had a sunstroke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What do the medical people say about it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Darn little.

When I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">Magnus about the threat that had been made against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strickland's life, he asked to be excused.

So near perpendicular was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lot that even a mountain goat would have found it</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult to climb from one end of it to the other. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">house itself was a charming example of the hillside type</seg><seg type="columnLine">of architecture which is so popular in certain parts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">California. It had a number of intriguing wings and ells</seg><seg type="columnLine">and towers, with windows on five different levels. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing familiar with dwellings of this character, Pryor</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that the living room would be on the top floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">level with the street, at the upper end of the lot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In response to Pryor's ring, the door was opened by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a maid. Almost immediately he was greeted by Lieu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenant Spangler.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come in, Mr. Pryor," he called over the servant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. "I'm sure glad to see you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Has the coroner arrived yet?" was Pryor's first</seg><seg type="columnLine">question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. Got here just a few minutes ago. He's ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amining the body now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good. How long do you think it will take him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring in an opinion?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's hard to say. Maybe a few minutes--maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long time. It all depends on how things look to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He may want to question the servants and the members</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the family, in which case it may take several hours."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I see. And in the meantime, suppose you tell me</seg><seg type="columnLine">how it happened."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mrs. Strickland found the body at about nine-thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">this morning. She and her husband occupy separate</seg><seg type="columnLine">chambers which are connected by a bathroom and are on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lower floor. She told me that Strickland has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinking a great deal lately. I wasn't at all surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear that, of course. He has always been a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinker. On account of the extra worry he's been</seg><seg type="columnLine">through lately, he has probably been hitting the booze</seg><seg type="columnLine">harder than ever. According to Mrs. Strickland's story,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she heard him enter the bathroom a few minutes before</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine o'clock. She spoke to him through the door, tell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him she would wait for him in the breakfast room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just before leaving her room, she heard him turn on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water of the shower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When he failed to show up after a reasonable time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she returned to see what was detaining him. On enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the bathroom she found her husband's body lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">senseless on the floor. When she screamed for help,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her daughter Clara and the butler, Jackson, heard her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and came running down the stairs.

I arrived on the scene just a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes after he did. By that time Strickland was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead.

Then to the butler: "Here, Hathaway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">show me the way to the garage, will you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For several minutes Pryor sat there and fidgeted. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the kind of man who had to be eternally busy at</seg><seg type="columnLine">something and this inactivity irked him. For want of</seg><seg type="columnLine">something else to do he sat down at the grand piano and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to play with his foot on the soft pedal. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbed was he in trying to recall an elusive strain</seg><seg type="columnLine">from "Liebestraum," that he did not hear the whirr of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elevator and the click of the door behind him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was therefore somewhat startled when a rich contralto</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice said almost in his ear, "Oh, I beg your pardon."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned and found himself looking into a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusually large, clear, blue eyes. There was a tragic</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistiness about those eyes that inspired sympathy as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as admiration. The wavy blond hair, the rose petal</seg><seg type="columnLine">complexion and the well-proportioned figure of the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">who stood before him, seemed to harmonize perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">with those eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pryor stammered an apology. "I hope you don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">think I am intruding here.

I cannot tell you how sorry I am now."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I appreciate your attitude, Mr. Pryor.

"The question</seg><seg type="columnLine">is still an open one.

So much for routine queries. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am going to ask you a very pertinent question: What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you know about Jackson, the butler who took Hath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">away's place?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I know very little about him, except that he seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be extremely anxious to please us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Do you know how he happened to be selected to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hathaway's place?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes. It was through Hathaway himself. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a very reasonable request for a leave of absence</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he could spend Christmas and the week following</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his relatives. He recommended Jackson as a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petent substitute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see. I presume that Jackson had access to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">father's bedroom--I mean during times when Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strickland was either absent or asleep?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, of course. Father never would have a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal valet. Jackson was frequently called upon to help</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to undress when he was--when he wasn't feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You said a moment ago that your father has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">worried. Under the circumstances it is perhaps only</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural that he may have used liquor more than usual."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes. He drank a great deal. Possibly that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to do with his untimely death."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Undoubtedly. And was it after he had been drink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that Jackson was called upon to help undress him?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">26</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes. That happened nearly every night during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past week."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Did he do his drinking at home or somewhere else?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"At home. I don't believe he left the house during</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the past three days."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I see. About how old is Jackson?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Close to fifty, I would judge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Will you please describe him to me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"He is of medium build--somewhat stocky. I would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">say that he weighs about one hundred and forty pounds</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and is about five feet six inches tall. He is quite active,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">although he is stoop-shouldered. His eyes are pale blue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">For a man of his age his hair is unusually thick. It is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">light brown, streaked with grey. It extends down on his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">face for some distance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Do you mean he has a beard?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I suppose you would call it that. His beard is the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">kind that English butlers are supposed .to* wear--side-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">boards, I believe they are called."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I see. Does Jackson wear glasses?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No. His eyesight seems to be good without the aid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of glasses."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Did you notice anything peculiar about him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"In what way?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Does he seem to be a typical servant? I mean in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his speech and conduct."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"His manners are excellent, if that's what you mean."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How about his vocabulary? I can easily tell that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you are very well educated yourself. Hasn't it impressed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you that Jackson's vocabulary is that of a scholar rather</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than a servant?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Now that you mention it, I believe he does give the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">impression that he is a man of learning. But that's not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at all surprising. During times like these there are lots</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Oxford graduates who are glad to take positions as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">servants in order to make both ends meet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Quite true. That's about all I need to know for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">present. Thank you very much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You are welcome, Mr. Pryor. But surely you do</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not suspect Jackson of doing anything wrong. If you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">do, I am certain you have made a mistake. He is such</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a sweet, kind-hearted man. I am sure he could never</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">harm anyone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">At that moment the front door opened and Spangler</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came rushing in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, excuse me," he said, when he saw the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You have met Miss Strickland, have you not, Lieu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tenant Spangler?" Pryor assumed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Sure I have. How are you, Miss Strickland? Sorry</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we have to bother you like this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That's quite all right," she answered graciously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Mr. Pryor and I had an interesting conversation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I took the liberty of asking Miss Strickland a few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">routine questions," Pryor explained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Will you excuse me now?" the girl asked. "I think</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I'd better see how mother is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Do so, by all means," Pryor urged her as he escorted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lifer to the elevator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Coroner's Report</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">WHEN the rectangle of light on the translucent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">door had shrunk to a mere thread, Pryor turned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and inquired, "Did you catch your man, lieu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tenant ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No such luck," Spangler growled. "He made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clean getaway. I've got the dragnet out, but now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is loose it's like fishing for one particular sardine in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole Pacific Ocean. Did you find out anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the girl?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing very significant. But what I did learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to corroborate my theory." And he gave the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tective an account of his interview with Miss Strickland.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the middle of the narrative the latch of the elevator</seg><seg type="columnLine">clicked and out stepped a stout, bald-headed man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was carrying a small leather case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, hello, Doc!" Spangler greeted him. "Shake</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands with Mr. Pryor." To the business counsellor he</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced, "This is Doctor Sheldon, the coroner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you do, Doctor Sheldon?" Pryor said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Have you satisfied yourself as to the cause of Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strickland's death."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes. Yes, indeed. It looks very much like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">case of cerebral hemorrhage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you mean that you think Mr. Strickland died a</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural death--that he was not murdered?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"It doesn't look like murder to me. There are no</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks on the body to indicate any act of violence."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Isn't it possible that his death was caused by poison ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Possible but not probable. The only way to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of that is by analyzing the viscera and I have made</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrangements for having that done at once. But I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to gamble on it that the tests will all be negative."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No doubt they will," Pryor agreed. "But what</seg><seg type="columnLine">about sunstroke? Wasn't the condition of the body the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same as would have been the case if Mr. Strickland had</seg><seg type="columnLine">died from sunstroke?'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sunstroke? Say, are you trying to ridicule me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Of course not, doctor. I realize that it sounds like</seg><seg type="columnLine">nonsense to suggest that a man could die of sunstroke in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bathroom on a January morning, but there is method</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my seeming madness, nevertheless. Perhaps I ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to explain that Mr. Strickland received a threatening</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter a few days ago and the author of the note hinted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had caused the death of five other men, all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom had died of sunstroke."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid that's too deep for me. But I can as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure you positively that Strickland's death was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused by sunstroke, heat exhaustion, or anything like</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And when do you expect to have the chemist's re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Unless he runs into unexpected difficulties, it ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be ready by tomorrow afternoon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you. And, by the way, doctor, I suppose you</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a look at the place where Mr. Strickland's body</seg><seg type="columnLine">was found?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure I did. He was found in the bathroom. Noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to arouse suspicion there, I can assure you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How about the light in the bathroom? Didn't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice anything peculiar about that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing except that it was slMl turned on. I switched</seg><seg type="columnLine">it off myself."	✓</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And are you sure that the lamp bulb was not an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual one? For instance, isn't it possible that it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">special kind of lamp--the kind that emits ultra-violet</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course not. The kind of light you have in mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">would require a special fixture."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why is that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because it operates on a low voltage--about ten or</seg><seg type="columnLine">SEVEN SUNSTROKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">27</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve volts. The lamp has to have a transformer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut down the line voltage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And how about the globe itself? I've seen pictures</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those therapeutic light globes. To me they looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">just like any ordinary globe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"They may look the same in a picture but they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether different in reality. The kind of lamp you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have in mind has both a filament and a carbon arc. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">also has some mercury inside the globe. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">juice is turned on the mercury vaporizes and that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">what produces the ultra-violet rays."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see. And you are sure that the globe in Mr. Strick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land's bathroom contained no mercury?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not exactly prepared to swear to it," the coroner</seg><seg type="columnLine">hedged. "If there is any doubt about it we can easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out right now. Suppose we have another look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that bathroom."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Entering the elevator the three men descended to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor on which Strickland's room was located. Spangler,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was the tallest of the trio, stood on the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bathtub and was just able to reach the globe. He un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">screwed it and handed it to Doctor Sheldon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see!" the coroner cried triumphantly, "It is an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary light globe--just as I said it was." He handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lamp to Pryor, who examined it carefully and had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit that there was nothing unusual about it. Never-</seg><seg type="columnLine">theless, while the other two were leaving the bathroom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pryor slipped the bulb into his coat pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Are there any other matters you would like to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared up?" Sheldon asked as they reentered the liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Not that I can think of right now. Thank you</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much for the help you have already given me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the coroner had left, Spangler remarked, "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric light business is all Greek to me. What did</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have in mind when you asked Doc about the globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bathroom ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Only this: You doubtless know that direct sunlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">contains certain rays that are not included in ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">artificial light. Among these are included the ultra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet rays. They are supposed to have powerful actinic</seg><seg type="columnLine">effects. For instance, there is reason to believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunburn of the human skin is caused by the ultra-violet</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiations."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What's that got to do with Strickland's death?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Just one of those hunches of mine, that's all. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred to me that, since the death of the other five</seg><seg type="columnLine">men was associated with exposure to direct sunlight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strickland's death might have been caused by some sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitute for sunlight, as for instance, one of those ultra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet ray lamps that Doctor Sheldon told us about."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T SEE what you're driving at now. But I'm' afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">A you're barking up the wrong tree this time."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Maybe so," Pryor laughed good naturedly. "Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times we have to bark up a lot of trees before we find</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one in which our quarry is hiding."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"True enough. And where do we start barking now?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My suggestion is that we find out all we can about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the circumstances surrounding the death of those other</seg><seg type="columnLine">five men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I should worry about them," the detective objected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You understand, don't you, that I'm not interested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any murders that were committed outside my territory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The only one I am concerned about is Strickland. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly and definitely responsible for investigating his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">death. But I have nothing to do with the other five."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That I realize fully, lieutenant; but don't you un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand that unless we are familiar with what hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to the others we may overlook some important</seg><seg type="columnLine">point in connection with Strickland's murder? Further-</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, if we can prove that the same man was associated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with each of the other five prior to their deaths, we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to weave a net of evidence around him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which even the cleverest of criminals could not escape."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now I get you. What do you want me to do?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Suppose you communicate with the authorities in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the places where each of these five men died. No doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have connections that will enable you to obtain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desired information, including a full account of the cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumstances surrounding their deaths. If it is possible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think we should also try to obtain descriptions of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">new friends, servants, or associates, whom these men</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in contact with immediately prior to the dates when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had their fatal attacks of sunstroke. Perhaps it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be a good idea to ascertain whether or not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">victims had anything to do with a man answering Jack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's description. And, by the way, how about a picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our suspect? Do you suppose we could get hold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good likeness of him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid not. Folks like the Stricklands are not in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the habit of exchanging portraits with their butlers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we don't know a thing about Jackson's family."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps Hathaway knows something about him,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pryor suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's a good hunch. Let's find out." Spangler rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a few minutes later, Hathaway made his appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you know about this man Jackson ?" the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tective demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very little, Sir. You see I met him by accident."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You met him by accident?" Spangler roared. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you mean by that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It happened about three weeks ago, Sir--on one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my evenings off. I decided to attend a cinema on Hol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lywood Boulevard. The play was very interesting, Sir.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was about a gentleman who masqueraded as a butler.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The name of it was-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind the name of the show," Spangler in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrupted him. "What I want to know is, how did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There was a line waiting for the nine o'clock show.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man standing next to me made a chance remark</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we started a conversation. Like myself, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. He seemed to be such an agreeable chap that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested that we sit together during the show. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">the show, he invited me to have a cup of coffee and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandwich with him. He told me that he was a butler</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seemed greatly surprised when I informed him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my occupation was the same as his. It was then that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the proposal to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What proposal?" Spangler wanted to know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The proposal to take my place, so that I could go on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vacation over New Year's. He told me that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been employed for some time but that he had saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough money so he had no reason to worry. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other hand he seemed to be afraid that he would get out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of practice if he didn't keep his hand in. For that</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason he was willing to do my work without compen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So that's how it happened, is it?" the detective in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terposed. "Let me get this straight: You meet this</seg><seg type="columnLine">28</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">man at a picture show. He buys you a sandwich and</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposes to you to let him take your place. He agrees</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work for nothing, so you can take a vacation with</seg><seg type="columnLine">full pay--is that correct ?'*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And without knowing anything more about this man</seg><seg type="columnLine">you recommended him to your employers and permitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to be brought into their home as a trusted servant ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But Mrs. Strickland was perfectly satisfied with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrangement, Sir. Jackson came here three days before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I left and worked with me so that he was thoroughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar with my duties."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not thinking about how he made good on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">job. What seems queer to me is that you and Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strickland should place so much confidence in a perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is true that in one sense he was a stranger to me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hathaway tried to defend himself. "But he was such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nice honest-looking man that I had no hesitation about</seg><seg type="columnLine">recommending him. I hope he hasn't stolen anything."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I guess he didn't steal anything," Spangler growled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But he may have done something a lot worse."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean by that, if you please, Sir?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Never mind what I mean.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he tried the Reader's Handbook and was rewarded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovering a significant article in the 1921 volume of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Journal of the Chemical Society.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a report presented to the British Association</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Advancement of Science, describing a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiments which had been performed by Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">E. C. C. Baly and I. M. Heilbrom. By passing a cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent of carbon dioxide through water exposed to ultra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet light, these two scientists had produced formal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dehyde. The same effect was also obtained with ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">light when malachite green was used as a catalyzer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This would have meant little to an ordinary layman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Pryor knew enough about chemistry to realize that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this experiment represented the first step toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulfilment of the scientist's fondest dreams--that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">creating living beings from inorganic materials. Man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had at last succeeded in performing a creative process</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had previously been regarded as a monopoly of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature. He had constructed an organic substance out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">materials that were exclusively inorganic. Any green</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaf can accomplish this feat of magic, but hitherto it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had baffled human ingenuity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Formaldehyde has the simplest possible formula for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a carbohydrate.

Plant physiologists be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve that when a growing leaf is exposed to the sunlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">the carbon dioxide gas (C02) in the air is reduced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carbon monoxide (CO), which, uniting with the hydro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gen of the water (H20) in the cell, forms formaldehyde</seg><seg type="columnLine">(CHoO). In the leaf of the plant this molecule multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plies itself by six and turns into a sweet, solid glucose</seg><seg type="columnLine">(C0H12O0) or, with the loss of water, into starch</seg><seg type="columnLine">(QH10O5).</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reflecting on the experiments of Baly and Heilbrom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scientist would naturally ask, "If man can artificially</seg><seg type="columnLine">build an organic compound, using only inorganic mate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rials, what is to prevent him from creating life itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a test-tube?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that wasn't the question that popped into Pryor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. After all he was not a professional chemist, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a solver of puzzles. To him the most significant</seg><seg type="columnLine">consideration was this: Using innocuous materials and</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy that abound everywhere, namely water, carbon</seg><seg type="columnLine">dioxide and LIGHT, two scientists had produced an</seg><seg type="columnLine">acrid smelling gas, called formaldehyde and known to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deadly POISON.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a bloodhound that has just caught a fresh scent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pryor searched eagerly for more information concern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">SEVEN SUNSTROKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">29</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the use of light in the artificial production of formal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dehyde and similar compounds. In a book called "Bio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemistry" by Dr. Benjamin Moore, he found this sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificant passage: "Such simple substances as formalde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hyde, formic acid, oxalic acid and hydrogen peroxide are</seg><seg type="columnLine">all poisonous to the highly organized and labile colloids</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bioplasm, and probably on account of that prop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erty which makes them essential in the first stages of</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolution--namely their high reactivity and the ease with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they take part in additional reactions of organic</seg><seg type="columnLine">substances. For this reason they must undergo change</seg><seg type="columnLine">in any living cell while still at high dilution, or else they</seg><seg type="columnLine">so interlock into the labile system of organic colloids</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the cell as to clog all metabolic change. Hence</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is that energy of light, which is essential to healthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth and the upbuilding of organic material from in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">organic, supplied in a wrong fashion, may reverse these</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicate processes, and cause death and degeneration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">living substances."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though Pryor had the feeling that he was "getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm," he knew that he had not yet found the key that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would unlock the door of his puzzle-case. So he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued his search. Late in the afternoon he stumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">across a book that was so small and insignificant look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that it might easily have escaped his notice. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him exactly what he had been hunting for--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of a substance which was not a poison but which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when introduced into the human system in the presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sunlight or its equivalent, would produce physiological</seg><seg type="columnLine">effects similar to those caused by sunstroke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This treatise told of experiments made by Dr. Fritz</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schanz of Germany, who had observed some remark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able transformations effected by haemato-prophyrin, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron-free disintegration product of the blood pigment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hemoglobin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In a dilution of one to eighty thousand it is capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of killing cultures of paramaecia in the light of a cloudy</seg><seg type="columnLine">winter day." Dr. Schanz was quoted as saying: "It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">also capable, in the presence of light, of dissolving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red blood corpuscles of the most various kinds of ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the dark, however, this substance has no effect,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to the article. "It is active only in the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of light. The reason for this is not, as might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed, that light converts the haemato-porphyrin into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a poison. On the contrary, solutions of this substance</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be exposed to the light for a long period without be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming a bit more poisonous than when kept in the dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By making use of this substance the warm blooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals can be rendered sensitive to light in the highest</seg><seg type="columnLine">degree. If small quantities of it are injected into white</seg><seg type="columnLine">mice the animals show no signs of injury as long as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not exposed to the light. But Hausmann found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the diffused daylight of an early spring day in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vienna was sufficient to produce death in mice which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had previously been injected with a solution of this sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance. Neither the haemato-porphyrin alone nor the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light alone, even in great intensity, is capable of injuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the animals. The injury is caused by the combined ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fects of the two. The acutest form of this malady pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duces a deep narcosis in the animal within a few min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes, after which death rapidly ensues. Hausmann gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">this condition the name of 'lightstroke' and he is of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion that a great many cases of sunstroke are con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected with similar processes of sensitivization."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Feeling well repaid for his afternoon of study, Pryor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to his home and spent a pleasant evening solving</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross-word puzzles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">More Light On the Subject</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT nine o'clock the following morning, Pryor in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed his secretary to call up the local plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a world-famous manufacturer of electrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I understand that you have an electric lamp that pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duces ultra-violet rays," he began the telephone conver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have several such devices," the man at the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the line told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it true that all lamps of this sort require special</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All those intended for human beings do.

Suppose we say that the lamp must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been put there on purpose. What of it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is logical that whoever put it there intended that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it should produce a lethal effect on Strickland, after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution of haemato-porphyrin had been injected into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his blood."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you think Jackson did that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I certainly do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how could a butler get away with anything like</seg><seg type="columnLine">SEVEN SUNSTROKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that? Strickland certainly would not permit him to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject a drug into his blood."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not if he knew about it, of course.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">has had plenty of opportunities to do that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And do you think he used the same system on Tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">res, Muller and the other three?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With variations. All five of them were chronic</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinkers. Jackson could easily have become acquainted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them by buying drinks for them. It would not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been difficult for a man of his skill to inject the drug</seg><seg type="columnLine">into their arms while they were drunk and unconscious.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In their cases, of course, it was not necessary to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultra-violet ray lamps. They all died while they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathing out of doors during the summer months."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's right. But, as I said before, Strickland's</seg><seg type="columnLine">death is the only one I need to worry about. If Jack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son injected a drug into his blood he must have left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark of the hypodermic syringe somewhere on his body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It ought to be easy enough to get a check on that. Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me see if I can get Doctor Sheldon on the phone."</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the girl at the switchboard had made the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sired connection Spangler picked up the telephone and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "Hello, Doc. About that Strickland case: Did</seg><seg type="columnLine">you notice any marks on his arms or legs that looked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might have been made by a hypodermic needle ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why didn't you tell me about that before?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Was there more than one mark?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then that doesn't look like he was using dope regu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larly, does it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks, doc.

There was only one needle mark on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, wasn't there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. It was on his upper left arm, right in the mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle of his vaccination mark.

The criminal mind and the scientific mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">are as far apart as the stars. To be a real scientist a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man must have a fervent passion for truth--and that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the way, is one of the clearest indications of morality.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The true scientist is glad to sacrifice his own material</seg><seg type="columnLine">benefit, his pleasures--his very life if need be--for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sake of adding one page, or even a single sentence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the world's store of knowledge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A confirmed criminal, on the other hand, has no re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gard for the truth.

Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had known Jackson had placed his age between</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty and fifty-five, but Woodbury didn't look any older</seg><seg type="columnLine">than thirty-five and he couldn't possibly have been more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than forty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nevertheless, Woodbury proved to be very valuable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Pryor for he furnished him with the name of an addi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional suspect--a man who probably knew more about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the action of light on chemical substances than any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemist in '.he west, but who. for some unknown reason,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been left off the list which Professor Bauer had</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnished to Pryor. The name of this man was Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Hermann Wilson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you wish to find out about haemato-porphyrin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the effect which it has when injected into the blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">of animals, you have come to the right place," Woodbury</seg><seg type="columnLine">told Pryor. "Last year the head of our department,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Hermann Wilson, performed a very interesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">series of experiments on white mice. Unfortunately he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not here now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You mean he is absent for today only."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"He has been on leave of absence for several monthjf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You see this is his sabbatical year."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"If that's the case I suppose he went abroad to study."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No. In fact he has been spending most of his time in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Southern California. Every once in a while he pops in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on us, locks himself up in his private laboratory for a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">week or two and then disappears as suddenly as he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"When was the last time you saw him, if I may ask?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"About a month ago. He is '.iable to bob up almost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">any time now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What sort of looking man is Professor Wilson?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pryor asked bluntly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"About my build. Like me, he also has blue eyes and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sand-colored hair."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Is he as tall as you are?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Not quite. About an inch shorter I would say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And you are about five feet eight inches tall, are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Hardly that much. Five feet seven would come</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">closer to it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Your colleague is an older man, I presume."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Not so very old. He's only fifty-one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And you are about, thirty-five?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"More than that. Thirty-eight, to be exact."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Thank you. I hope you do not think I am too in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quisitive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Not at all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Are you familiar with Professor Wilson's experi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ments?" Pryor inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, yes. I helped him with some of them. But I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">finally had to beg off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And why was that, if I may ask?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I hate to tell you," Woodbury grinned sheepishly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The fact of the matter is that I am altogether too</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">squeamish to be a good biologist. Inorganic chemistry</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is more in my line. You see I can't stand seeing helpless</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little animals suffer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I can readily understand that," Pryor assured him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How about Professor Wilson? From what you say I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">don't imagine he has any compunctions against inflicting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pain on animals in the interests of science."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, you mustn't think he is cruel or anything like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that. He's just a good scientist, that's all. He takes the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">attitude that the end justifies the means."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Would you mind describing the experiments which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you saw Professor Wilson perform."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why certainly. But just a minute. That sounded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like Doctor Wilson's step." Woodbury darted to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">door, threw it open and called down the corridor: "Doc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tor Wilson! Would you mind coming into my office?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A moment later Pryor was being introduced to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eminent chemist. Professor Wilson's countenance was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grim and forbidding. It looked like the face of a man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">who had met with a fearful tragedy and had become</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">soured against the entire world. The coolness of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">demeanor, which bordered on rudeness, was in marked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">contrast with the friendly, courteous good nature of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Professor Woodbury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Mr. Pryor is interested in your experiments with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">haemato-porphyrin," Woodbury explained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Is that so?" Turning to Pryor he demanded. "What</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are you doing here? Why do you want to know about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my experiments? Who are you anyway?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Driven by necessity, Pryor did some quick thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">34</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and some glib lying: "I am a veterinarian," he fibbed. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was engaged by a man who operates a large poultry</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch. Several of his thoroughbred roosters have died</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysteriously. From the circumstances surrounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">their deaths it looks as if sunlight had something to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it. I had never heard of any similar cases before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I studied up on the chemistry of light. It occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me that something like that substance may have caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">the death of those roosters. I shall appreciate it very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much if you will show me one of your experiments or at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least explain the principle of it to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This ingenious fabrication seemed to satisfy Wilson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he led Pryor into the sanctorum of his stuffy pri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vate laboratory. From a shelf Wilson took down an</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight-ounce glass jar and handed it to Pryor. "This,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said dramatically, "is haemato-porphyrin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pryor held the jar up to the light. It was about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter full of a beautiful, fluorescent, dark red powder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I also have it in solution," Wilson explained. "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown solution is alkaline. The red one is an acid</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Which one do you use in your experiments?" Pryor</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Either. It really doesn't matter. The same results</seg><seg type="columnLine">are obtained in either case. Would you like to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect which this has on an animal?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If it isn't too much trouble."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I wasn't willing to do it I wouldn't make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer," Wilson growled without the slightest suggestion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He departed and came back a few minutes later with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a white mouse squirming in his bony hand. From a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawer he produced a small black object which turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to be a tiny sweater. Wilson fitted the odd garment</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the animal's body in such a way that only the legs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tail and the tip of the mouse's nose were exposed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now we'll have to go into the dark room," he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced as he led the way into a tiny chamber which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was illuminated only by the blood-red glow of a ruby</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With an ordinary hypodermic syringe," he explained,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I inject a small quantity of the solution into the blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream of the mouse. As long as I keep it in the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">it will behave in a perfectly normal manner. But notice</seg><seg type="columnLine">what happens when I place it in the sunlight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He carried the animal back into the laboratory and put</seg><seg type="columnLine">it inside a wooden box which was open at the top. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on a bench in front of a window through which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon sunlight was streaming. Wilson opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window and placed the box so that the direct rays of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun shone into it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it necessary to open the window?" Pryor asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. You see this is ordinary window glass. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">opaque to the ultra-violet rays in the sunlight. If the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass panes of the sash were quartz it would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary to open the window. Watch what happens to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mouse."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a while the animal scampered around in the shaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the box, apparently none the worse for the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience. But when it trotted out into the lighted part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the receptacle, it suddenly began to stagger. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few seconds its legs crumpled and it lay on its side as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if paralyzed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wilson picked the box up and carried it back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark room. Almost instantly the mouse revived and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to run around as if nothing had happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">♦</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why did you put that black garment on the mouse ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pryor inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To protect its body from the light," Wilson eluci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dated. "The paralysis of the animal's limbs which you</seg><seg type="columnLine">just witnessed was due to the fact that its legs were ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to the light. Because only a small part of its body</seg><seg type="columnLine">was affected, I was able to revive it by taking it away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the light. Notice what happens when I remove the</seg><seg type="columnLine">protection of the sweater."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He picked up the mouse and took off the tiny black</seg><seg type="columnLine">garment. Then he put it back in the box and carried it</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the laboratory again. The light from the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">window had hardly fallen on the back of the little crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture before it toppled over and lay limp and motionless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Back into the dark room the professor carried the box.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But this time the mouse did not revive, even after Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son had tried to bring it back by forcing oxygen into</seg><seg type="columnLine">its lungs and by using other methods of resuscitation. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny heart had stopped beating. It had ceased to breathe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was stone dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After witnessing the murder of this innocent animal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pryor could readily sympathize with Woodbury, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had balked at being a party to such scientific slayings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He said nothing, however, except a word of appreciation</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thanks to Professor Wilson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the way, Professor," he remarked, "is it neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary to use direct sunlight in order to produce effects</seg><seg type="columnLine">like this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why do you ask that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was wondering. You said something about ultra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet rays. It is possible to produce such rays artifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cially, is it not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Certainly. I sometimes use artificial sources of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my experiment. Here is one of the lamps I use."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pryor bent over and looked up at the light bulb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose that metallic spot is mercury," he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes. All of these lamps have mercury in them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the current is turned on some of the mercury</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaporizes. That's what produces the ultra-violet rays."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Isn't it possible to produce ultra-violet rays with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulb that doesn't contain mercury?" Pryor asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not that I know of," Wilson replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps I am wrong," said the visitor, "But I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard that there is a new type of lamp which was intro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced recently for use in the poultry industry. It oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ates in an ordinary light socket and contains no mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cury."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, you mean the CX lamps," Woodbury vol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">unteered. "You've heard of them, haven't you Doctor?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Only superficially," Wilson admitted. "My impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion is that those new lamps are still in the experimental</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage. Do you know anything about them ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not much. But I know that they will produce ultra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet rays."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One more question, if you please, Professor Wilson,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pryor interposed. "Do you know whether or not the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periment you just conducted would work with a larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal--say one as large as a sheep?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His answer was startling. "Most assuredly. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried it myself on half a dozen large animals. Some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them were considerably larger than sheep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the results ?" Pryor prompted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The results? Well, I would call them extremely</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratifying," and for the first time since Pryor had met</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, Professor Wilson smiled. But there was no mirth</seg><seg type="columnLine">SEVEN SUNSTROKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in that smile. It reminded Pryor of the horrible grin</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the face of a man-eating shark. It made him shud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With hasty expressions of thanks to both the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">of science Pryor took his departure. He was glad to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get outdoors where he could fill his lungs with pure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">untainted air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           CHAPTER XII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           More Suspects</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PRYOR spent the next few days visiting the chem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical laboratories of universities in different parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Southern California, and in interviewing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other three men on his list.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first of these was Theron Ward, Ph.D. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">short and slender. Pryor guessed his weight to be not</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than one hundred and twenty pounds. Except for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a narrow fringe of dark-brown hair, his head was bald.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Large, bulging eyes, dull grey in color, seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">always staring as if in perpetual surprise. This effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">was accentuated by a pair of enormous spectacles with</seg><seg type="columnLine">concave lenses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pryor opened the conversation by asking Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ward if he was familiar with Benjamin Moore's experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments in producing formaldehyde from carbon dioxide</seg><seg type="columnLine">and water exposed to ultra-violet light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, yes," Ward told him. "It happens that I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been doing some work along that same line myself. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have to confess that my experiments thus far have not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been very satisfactory. I have not been able to produce</seg><seg type="columnLine">formaldehyde without the aid of a catalyst, such as fer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ric chloride or ferric oxide."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know of any other examples of poisonous</seg><seg type="columnLine">substances being produced by exposing non-poisonous</seg><seg type="columnLine">compounds to sunlight or ultra-violet rays ?" Pryor asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Offhand I can't think of any such example," the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor replied. "Why ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought possibly you might be familiar with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work which Doctor Wilson has been doing with haemato-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porphyrin injected into the blood of animals."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pryor thought he saw a startled look come into those</seg><seg type="columnLine">large, bulging eyes, but of this he could not be certain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The answer came readily enough. "I'm sorry, but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is out of my line. I know nothing whatever about Doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor Wilson's work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doubtless you have used this substance haemato-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porphyrin for other purposes?" Pryor suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I have not. To tell you the truth, I know abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely nothing about it. Organic chemistry is a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad subject, you know. You can hardly expect one</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to be familiar with every individual phase of it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Of course not." Pryor agreed. "From what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, I assume that there isn't any haemato-porphyrin</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the shelves of your laboratories."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm certain that there is none of it here," Ward as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sured him. "Perhaps Doctor Wilson could furnish you</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a small quantity of it if you wished to use it for ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perimental purposes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you for the suggestion," said the business</seg><seg type="columnLine">counsellor. "You have been very considerate. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will be willing to answer one more question."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, certainly. I shall be glad to answer your ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions--if I can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pryor's question was: "Do you know of a kind of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a lamp which can be operated in an ordinary light socket</seg><seg type="columnLine">and which will deliver ultra-violet rays ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, yes. There is such a light. It is made by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American Electric Company, I believe. The bulb is</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of quartz glass."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know whether a lamp of that sort actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">does produce ultra-violet rays?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Undoubtedly it does. Of course the rays from such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a source will not be as powerful as those renerated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the regular ultra-violet ray tubes, but I am sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">some ultra-violet light can be produced with a lamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as you describe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you happen to know the trade name of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">special lamps."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. I do not. You can probably find out by phon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the local office of the American Electric Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you, Professor. I appreciate your courtesy</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are quite welcome. Sorry I couldn't be of more</seg><seg type="columnLine">help to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have helped me more than you realize," was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pryor's significant comment. "And, by the way, Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor, I suppose you were away during the holidays."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once more those bulging eyes seemed to protrude</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trifle further than usual. For an instant Ward hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated, then he answered calmly, "Oh, yes. My daughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives in Oakland. She has two children. I always spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christmas and New Year's day with her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next man whom Pryor interviewed was John Holt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor of chemistry at Cabrillo University. Except</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the color of his eyes and his general build, he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not resemble very closely the mental picture which Pryor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had constructed from the descriptions of Jackson. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing, he was much younger, forty-three, to be exact.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His height was hardly more than five feet five inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his weight approximately one hundred and thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five pounds. The corners of his mouth drooped con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly.

With the one hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ten volt ultra-violet lamps, however, he seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar, although he expressed doubt if they actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced ultra-violet rays potent enough to produce</seg><seg type="columnLine">effects comparable to sunlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last interview was with a department head in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of California's largest institutions of learning.

She did not remember how it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be there and crossed with idle curiosity to examine it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The doctor was aroused from his reverie by the note</seg><seg type="columnLine">of excitement in her voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Look here, father," she called sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What's that ?" he asked, catching sight of the wad of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheets in her hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As he came closer he could see that the top one was</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with strange characters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What on earth ... ?" he began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Joan's voice was curt with his stupidity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Don't you see?" she cried. "It's written this for us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor brightened for a moment; then the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression of gloom returned to his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But how can we . . . ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The thing wasn't a fool--it must have learned enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our language to put a key in somewhere to all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird stuff, even if it couldn't write the whole thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in English. Look, this might be it, it looks even queerer</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the rest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Several weeks of hard work followed for Joan in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts to decipher the curious document, but she held</seg><seg type="columnLine">on with painstaking labor until she was able to lay the</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete text before her father. That evening he picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the pile of typed sheets and read steadily, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">interruption, to the end. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Arrival</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">S we slowed to the end of our journey, Banuff be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to show signs of excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look," he called to me. "The third planet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I crossed to stand beside him and together we gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon a stranger scene than any other fourth planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes have ever seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though we were still high above the surface, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was plenty to cause us astonishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In place of our own homely red vegetation, we beheld</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brilliant green. The whole land seemed to be covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it. Anywhere and everywhere it clung and thrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though it needed no water. On the fourth planet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the third planet men call Mars, the vegetation</seg><seg type="columnLine">grows only in or around the canals, but here we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even see any canals. The only sign of irrigation</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one bright streak of water in the distance, twisting</seg><seg type="columnLine">senselessly over the countryside--a symbolic warning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the incredible world we had reached.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here and there our attention was attracted by out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">croppings of various strange rocks amid all this green.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great masses of stone which sent up plumes of black</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The internal fires must be very near the surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this world," Banuff said, looking doubtfully at the rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See in how many places the smoke breaks out. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should doubt whether it has been possible for animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">life to evolve on such a planet. It is possible yet that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground may be too hot for us--or rather for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was a regret in his tone. The manner in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he voiced the last sentence stirred my sympathy. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are so many disadvantages in human construction which</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not occur in us machines, and I knew that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager to obtain first hand knowledge of the third planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For a long time we gazed in silent speculation at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer, green world. At last Banuff broke the silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I think we'll risk a landing there, Zat," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicating a smooth, open space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You don't think it might be liquid," I suggested, "it</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks curiously level."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No," he replied, "I fancy it's a kind of close vege-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation. Anyway, we can risk it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A touch 011 the lever sent the machine sinking rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards a green rectangle, so regular as to suggest the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of sentient creatures. On one of its sides lay a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large stone outcrop, riddled with holes and smoking</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the top like the rest, while on the other three sides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick vegetation rose high and swayed in the wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An atmosphere which can cause such commotion</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be very dense," commented Banuff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That rock is peculiarly regular," I said, "and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking points are evenly spaced. Do you suppose . . .?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The slight jar of our landing interrupted me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Get ready, Zat," Banuff ordered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was ready. I opened the inner door and stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air-lock. Banuff would have to remain inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">until I could find out whether it was possible for him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjust. Men may have more power of originality than</seg><seg type="columnLine">we, and they do possess a greater degree of adaptability</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any other form of life, but their limitations are,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nevertheless, severe. It might require a deal of ponder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous apparatus to enable Banuff to withstand the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditions, but for me, a machine, adaptation was simple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The density of the atmosphere made no difference</seg><seg type="columnLine">save slightly to slow my movements. The temperature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">within very wide limits, had no effect upon me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The gravity will be stronger," Banuff had warned</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, "this is a much larger planet than ours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It had been easy to prepare for that by the addition</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a fourth pair of legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now, as I walked out of the air-lock, I was glad of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them; the pull of the planet was immense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a moment or so of minor adjustment, I passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">around our machine to the window where Banuff stood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and held up the instruments for him to see. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">read the air pressure meter, the gravity indicator and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gas proportion scale, he shook his head. He might</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly adapt himself partway to the conditions, but an</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediate venture was out of the question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It had been agreed between us that in such an event</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should perform the exploration and specimen collect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing while he examined the neighborhood from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He waved his arm as a signal and, in response, I set</seg><seg type="columnLine">off at a good pace for the surrounding green and brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">growths. I looked back as I reached them to see our</seg><seg type="columnLine">silvery craft floating slowly up into the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A second later, there came a stunning explosion; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave of sound so strong in this thick atmosphere that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it almost shattered my receiving diaphragm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The cause of the disaster must always remain a mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery : I only know that when I looked up, the vessel was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nowhere to be seen--only a rain of metal parts dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">to earth all about me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Cries of alarm came from the large stone outcrop and</seg><seg type="columnLine">simultaneously human figures appeared at the lowest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its many openings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They began to run towards the vreck, but my speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was far greater than theirs. They can have made but</seg><seg type="columnLine">half the distance while I completed it. As I flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST MACHINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">across, I could see them falter and stop with ludicrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressions of dismay on their faces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lord, did you see that?" cried one of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the devil was it?" called another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looked like a coffin on legs," somebody said. "Mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing some, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Flight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ANUFF lay in a ring of scattered debris.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gently I raised him on my fore-rods. A very</seg><seg type="columnLine">little examination showed that it was useless to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt any assistance: he was too badly broken. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to smile faintly at me and then slid into uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was sorry. Though Banuff was not of my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind, yet he was of my own world and on the long trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had grown to know him well. These humans are so</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragile. Some little thing here or there breaks--they</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop working and then, in a short time, they are decom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posing. Had he been a machine, like myself, I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have mended him, replaced the broken parts and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as good as new, but with these animal structures</seg><seg type="columnLine">one is almost helpless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I became aware, while I gazed at him, that the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men and women had drawn closer and I began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffer for the first time from what has been my most</seg><seg type="columnLine">severe disability on the third planet--I could not com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">municate with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their thoughts were understandable, for my sensitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate was tuned to receive human mental waves, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not make myself understood. My language was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unintelligible to them, and their minds, either from lack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of development or some other cause, were unreceptive</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my thought-radiations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they approached, huddled into a group, I made an</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishing discovery--they were afraid of me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men afraid of a machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was incomprehensible. Why should they be afraid?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surely man and machine are natural complements: they</seg><seg type="columnLine">assist one another. For a moment I thought I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have misread their minds--it was possible that thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">registered differently on this planet, but it was a possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility I soon dismissed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were only two reasons for this apprehension.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The one, that they had never seen a machine or, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, that third planet machines had pursued a line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">development inimical to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned to show Banuff lying inert on my fore-rods.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, slowly, so as not to alarm them, I approached. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid him down softly on the ground near by and retired</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short distance. Experience has taught me that men</seg><seg type="columnLine">like their own broken forms to be dealt with by their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own kind. Some stepped forward to examine him, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest held their ground, their eyes fixed upon me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Banuff's dark coloring appeared to excite them not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little. Their own skins were pallid from lack of ultra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet rays in their dense atmosphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dead?" asked one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quite dead," another one nodded. "Curious looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow," he continued. "Can't place him ethnologically</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all. Just look at the frontal formation of the skull</seg><seg type="columnLine">--very odd. And the size of his ears, too, huge: the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole head is abnormally large."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind him now," one of the group broke in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"he'll keep. That's the thing that puzzles me," he went</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on, looking in my direction. "What the devil do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose it is?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They all turned wondering faces towards me. I stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless and waited while they summed me up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About six feet long," ran the thoughts of one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. "Two feet broad and two deep. White metal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be--(his thought conveyed nothing to me). Four</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs to a side, fixed about halfway up--jointed rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a crab's, so are the arm-like things in front: but</seg><seg type="columnLine">all metal. Wonder what the array of instruments and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenses on this end are? Anyhow, whatever kind of power</seg><seg type="columnLine">it uses, it seems to have run down now. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hesitatingly he began to advance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tried a word of encouragement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole group froze rigid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you hear that?" somebody whispered. "It--it</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Loud speaker," replied the one who had been making</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inventory of me. Suddenly his expression bright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got it," he cried. "Remote control--a telephony</seg><seg type="columnLine">and television machine worked by remote control."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So these people did know something of machinery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all. He was far wrong in his guess, but in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief I took a step forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An explosion roared: something thudded on my body</seg><seg type="columnLine">case and whirred away. I saw that one of the men was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing a hollow rod at me and I knew that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to make another explosion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first had done 110 injury but another might crack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of my lenses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned and made top speed for the high, green vege-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation. Two or three more bursts roared behind, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing touched me. The weapon was very primitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grossly inaccurate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Disappointment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OR a day and a night I continued on among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard stemmed growths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time since my making, I was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely out of touch with human control, and my exis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tence seemed meaningless. The humans have a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">force they call ambition. It drives them, and, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, it drives us. This force which keeps them active,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we lack. Perhaps, in time, we machines will acquire it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something of the kind--self-preservation which is allied</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it--must have made me leave the man with the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosive tube and taken me into the strange country. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not enough to give me an objective. I seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go on because--well, because my machinery was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed to go 011.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the way I made some odd discoveries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every now and then my path would be crossed by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">band of hard matter, serving no useful purpose which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could then understand. Once, too, I found two unending</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods of iron fixed horizontally to the ground and stretch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing away into the distance on either side. At first I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought they might be a method of guarding the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond, but they presented no obstacle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, I found that the frequent outcroppings of stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not natural, but laboriously constructed. Obvious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly this primitive race, with insufficient caves to hold its</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing numbers, had been driven to construct artificial</seg><seg type="columnLine">caves. The puzzling smoke arose from their method of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heating these dwellings with naked fire--so wasteful a</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">system of generating heat that no flame has been seen on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fourth planet,* save in an accident, for thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was during the second day that I saw my first</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine on this planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It stood at the side of one of the hard strips of land</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had caused me so much wonder. The glitter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light upon its bright parts caught my lenses as I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the bushes. My delight knew no bounds--at</seg><seg type="columnLine">la.«t I had found a being of my own kind. In my excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment I gave a call to attract its attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a flurry of movement round the far side</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a human figure raised its head to look at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was able to tell that she was a woman despite the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange coverings that the third planet humans put upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves. She stared at me, her eyes widening in</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise while I could feel the shock in her mind. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">spanner dropped from her hand and then, in a flash,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was into the machine, slamming the door behind her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There came a frantic whirring as she pressed a knob,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it produced no other result.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly I continued to advance and as I came, the agita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in her mind increased. I had no wish to alarm her</seg><seg type="columnLine">--it would have been more peaceful had her thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves ceased to bombard me--but I was determined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know this machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I drew clear of the bushes, I obtained a full view</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the thing for the first time and disappointment hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">me like a blow. The thing had wheels. Not just neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessary parts of its internal arrangements, but wheels</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually in contact with the ground. In a flash the</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation of all these hard streaks came to me. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">believable though it may seem, this thing could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow a track specially built for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later I found that this was more or hss true of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">third planetf land machines, but my first discouragement</seg><seg type="columnLine">was painful. The primitive barbarity of the thing sad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dened me more than any discovery I had yet made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Forlornly, and with little hope, I spoke to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It stood there dumbly inert upon its foolish wheels</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though it were a part of the ground itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Walking closer, I began to examine with growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgust its crude internal arrangements. Incredibly, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that its only means of propulsion was by a series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of jerks from frequent explosions. Moreover, it was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">ludicrously unorganized that both driving engine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brakes could be applied at the same time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sadly, as I gazed at the ponderous parts within, I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to feel that I was indeed alone. Until this encounter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hope of discovering an intelligent machine had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">really died. But now I knew that such a thing could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not exist in the same world with this monster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of my fore-rods brushed against a part of it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rasping sound and there came a startled cry of alarm</seg><seg type="columnLine">from within. I looked up to the glass front where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman's face peered affrightedly. Her mind was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a state of confusion that it was difficult to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">her wants clearly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She hoped that I would go away--no, she wished the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car would start and carry her away--she wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether I were an animal, whether I even really ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isted. In a jumble of emotions she was afraid and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time wa£ angry with herself for being afraid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last I managed to grasp that the machine was unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run. I turned to find the trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I labored with the thing's horrible vitals, it be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came clear to me why men, such as I had met, showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of me. No wonder they feared machines when</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own mechanisms were as inefficient and futile as</seg><seg type="columnLine">this. What reliance or trust could they place in a ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine so erratic--so helpless that it could not even tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porarily repair itself? It was not under its own control</seg><seg type="columnLine">and only partially under theirs. Third planet men's at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titude became understandable--commendable--if all their</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines were as uncertain as this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The alarm in the woman's mind yielded to amazement</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she leaned forward and watched me work. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to think me unreal, a kind of hallucination:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must be dreaming," she told herself. "That thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't really be mending my car for me. It's impossible;</seg><seg type="columnLine">some kind of horrid nightmare. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came a flash of panic at the thought of mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, but her mind soon rebalanced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I just don't understand it," she said firmly and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though that settled it, proceeded to wait with a grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing calm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last I had finished. As I wiped the thing's coarse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but necessary oil from my fore-rods, I signalled her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">i^ush again on the black knob. The whirr this time was</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded by a roar--never would I have believed that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine could be so inefficient.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the pandemonium I received an impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gratitude on my thought plate. Mingling traces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervousness remained, but first stood gratitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then she was gone. Down the hard strip I watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disgusting machine dwindle away to a speck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I turned back to the bushes and went slowly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my way. Sadly I thought of the far away, red fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet and knew that my fate was sealed. I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">build a means of return. I was lost--the only one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my kind upon this primitive world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Beasts</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY came upon me as I crossed one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth, green spaces so frequent on this world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My thought-cells were puzzling over my condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. On the fourth planet I had felt interest or dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest, inclination or the lack of it, but little more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now I had discovered reactions in myself which, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">they lain in a human being, I should have called emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. I was, for instance, lonely: I wanted the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany of my own kind. Moreover,- I had begun to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience excitement or, more particularly, apathy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An apathetic machine!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was considering whether this state was a develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment from the instinct of self preservation, or whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might not be due to the action of surrounding matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my chemical cells, when I heard them coming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First there was a drumming in my diaphragm, swell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing gradually to a thunderous beat which shook the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. Then I turned to see them charging down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Enormous beasts, extinct on my planet a million years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with hair and bearing spikes on their heads.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Four-footed survivals of savagery battering across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land in unreasoning ferocity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only one course was possible since my escape was cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">off by the windings of one of the imbecile-built canals.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I folded my legs beneath me, crossed my fore-rods pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tectingly over my lenses and diaphragms, and waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars. tThe earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST MACHINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They slowed as they drew close. Suspiciously they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up to me and snuffled around. One of them gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rap to my side with his spiked head, another pawed my</seg><seg type="columnLine">case with a hoofed foot. I let them continue: they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not seem to offer any immediate danger. Such primitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals, I thought, would be incapable of sustaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest and soon move off elsewhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But they did not. Snuffling and rooting continued all</seg><seg type="columnLine">around me. At last I determined to try an experimental</seg><seg type="columnLine">waving of my fore-rods. The result was alarming. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged and milled around, made strange bellowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">noises and stamped their hooves, but they did not go</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Neither did they attack, though they snorted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pawed the more energetically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the distance I heard a man's voice; his thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached me faintly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the 'ell's worritin' them dam cattle, Bill?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dunno," came the reply of another. "Let's go an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">'ave a look."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The beasts gave way at the approach of the man and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear some of them thudding slowly awav, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not, as yet, care to risk uncovering my lenses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men's voices drew quite near.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Strewth," said the first, " 'ow did that get 'ere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Search me," answered the other.

" 'Ow could a thing like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that move?

I followed them</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly: it seemed as good a direction as any other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The buildings, not all of stone, were arranged so as</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost to enclose a square. As the men disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">through an opening in one side, I could hear their voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised in warning and others demanding the reason for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their excitement. I turned the corner in time to face a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaggling group of ten or twelve. Abruptly it broke as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they ran to dark openings in search of safety. All, save</seg><seg type="columnLine">one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I halted and looked at this remaining one.

I found his mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">processes difficult to follow. They were jumbled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">erratic, hopping from this mind picture to that in un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlled jerks. But he was unafraid of me and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad of it. The first third planet man I had met who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not terror-ridden. Nevertheless, he seemed to doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">my reality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You fellowsh shee the shame s'l do?" he called deaf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eningly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Muffled voices all around assured him that this was so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Thash all right, then," he observed with relief, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">took a step forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I advanced slowly not to alarm him and wre met in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">middle of the yard.

"Goo' ol'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feller.

"Lie down.

"Don't say</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">afterwards that I didn't warn you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I could hear the rest of them retire to what they con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sidered a safe distance.

Suddenly there was complete dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness ; even the vapor glow was quenched. From out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness a blinding flash split the darkness and a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">later the three observers were literally blown to earth by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a concussion that made all deaf for a full minute. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete blackness save for the points of stars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wow! Wasn't that an ear splitter?" said Big John.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this moment the next "spasm" began, and the trio</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched with wonder the issuance of the pink vapor, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">billowing, and when the darkness came, they all threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves flat and placed hands over their ears. An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other terrific explosion--then silence and darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long do you believe these signals will last?" Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">John asked his question in a rather worried tone of</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Signals will continue at more or less regular inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vals for weeks unless we can find a way to stop them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would seem reasonable to expect some sort of method</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stopping them to be provided by the being who de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed that cylinder.

At</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunrise Big John was at his side. After con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable experimentation, the exposed shell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinder yielded to a pry bar, and a large section of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinder flew off, revealing a dim interior. The three</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigators climbed in and gazed about them. Evenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">distributed about the small room were beings lying as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though dead. The general appearance of each was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a quadruped, in size about as large as a big bulldog.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rest of the body was perfectly smooth and nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shape of an egg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To one side of the small circular room Jameson found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a metal box closed by a common hasp type of fastening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This he quickly opened. Inside was a large sheaf of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">material that resembled paper but was certainly a su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perior material. With the assistance of Big John, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">box and sheaf were wrenched loose from the small shelf</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which they had been fastened. Unfolding the sheaf</seg><seg type="columnLine">of opaque, yet unbelievably thin sheets of paper-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">material, they gazed with utter awe upon the most beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful panorama photograph in colors that man could</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine. Across the top of the picture was a long set</seg><seg type="columnLine">of characters--very evidently writing of some sort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Passing over the photo to the rest of the manuscript,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three people attempted to make something of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautifully executed figures they found there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">COSMIC STEEPLE-CHASE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">51'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Obviously this is writing, but of what kind we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">only guess.

One</seg><seg type="columnLine">photo showed what was evidently an evening scene.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strangely enough there were three suns setting along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon.

"We'll find</seg><seg type="columnLine">many interesting things if I'm not mistaken.

To the upper left was a grouping of stars, evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently seven of them in a group. Down at the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge was a set of stars which could be recognized only as</seg><seg type="columnLine">one group--that commonly known as the Big Dipper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">True to our view of stars, the two outer stars in the cup</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dipper formed a nearly direct line toward a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant star on the map located about one-third the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the left edge of the map. This star was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant red color with a few rays about it. Easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized about this were a few less brilliant stars</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged in the form of the familiar Little Bear. About</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big, bright, red star picture were arranged ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">small dots, all at diiferent positions. From the fifth dot</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from the red star was a line which streamed across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pictured space in a magnificent curve terminating</seg><seg type="columnLine">at one of nine dots surrounding a rather small yellow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish spot which evidently was a star.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me show you," said Dr. Jameson. "Here we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the left. You recognize the Great Bear or Big Dipper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It, of course, points to the North Star, Polaris, with two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its stars. Polaris is part of the Little Bear which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">see represented by those stars about Polaris. Over here</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see the tiny yellow star surrounded by its nine dots.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alice, if you can't deduce the meaning of that from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of the constellations, I fear your courses with me</seg><seg type="columnLine">were lost motion and energy. What puny little star do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you think that is?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, Dr. Jameson, it's our own tiny old Sol, and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dots are its nine children, the planets. Furthermore, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line sweeping across the space shown here is supposed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">represent the path of this cylinder in which we stand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading us to infer that this cylinder was made and pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected from the fifth planet of a planetary system about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polaris.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, Dad, what you don't know is that Polaris is 407</seg><seg type="columnLine">trillion miles from us and that therefore its light requires</seg><seg type="columnLine">some 69 years to reach us. According to calculation, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder could have been made fairly recently, as we do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not believe that speed of material objects in space is</seg><seg type="columnLine">limited except by the time required to acquire velocity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or should I say to exercise acceleration. Of course, light</seg><seg type="columnLine">travels rapidly, but even light is slow compared to what</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed might be attained by a properly attracted or pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelled object which traveled freely in space."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," gasped the professor, "that is exactly what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">deduced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's go and get some lunch, though.

"Now that we thoroughly under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand each other," he added as a parting shot, and turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on his heel got into his car and drove off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE next morning, about nine o'clock, a young man</seg><seg type="columnLine">called at the farm and asked to see Jameson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Alice who met him and informed him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jameson would be back from town shortly. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meantime it would be her pleasure to entertain a friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Professor Jameson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My name is Allen Bellant," the caller told her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am Alice Baldwin. I was a student under Profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor Jameson last year in college. I studied astronomy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his classes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess you are interested in the interstellar visitor</seg><seg type="columnLine">you had last spring then," the visitor suggested. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder is my reason for coming, although I see now I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know what attractions there were up here," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued, looking boldly at the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alice flushed and laughed confusedly. She was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure she liked this young fellow--yet he was young and</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be interesting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mayn't I show you about the farm a little?" the girl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested, and presently the two of them were wander-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from meadow to woodland, from pasture land to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barnyard, laughing and talking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shortly Harry Jameson drove up, parked his car, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went into the house. A little later he came out, looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">about for Alice and, seeing her with a young man, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided not to interrupt. As he was turning to sit down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the porch, Alice saw him and immediately brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bellant to the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Professor Jameson, this is Mr. Bellant, a friend of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours. I have been entertaining him while he awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">your return from town."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bellant! Of course I know him. He was a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid in helping us over certain technical points in decod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the plans we looked at last night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jameson welcomed Bellant warmly and asked what</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him this far from his home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Explanations followed and Bellant gave Jameson a let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of introduction and instruction from Jordan Blake</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which the financier asked that Bellant be given all de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails as he was to accompany the party on the Polaris</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip. Since Bellant had an exceptionally good reputation</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a physicist, Jameson was very pleased with the pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect. Had he known to what direction Bellant's atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was going to turn during this proposed trip, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never have consented to go ahead with the plans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even during the examination of the cylinder and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long discussion in the afternoon, Harry found much</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusement in the rather open admiration Bellant showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alice, sometimes to the girl's confusion. Several times</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jameson found Bellant's mind and eyes centered on Alice</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the end of a long explanation of some parts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans for the ship and trip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That evening Bellant proposed that the whole family</seg><seg type="columnLine">go into town to see a movie. After much discussion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the family decided that just Alice, Harry, and Bellant</seg><seg type="columnLine">should go, and that the rest would stay at home this time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was finally so arranged, and the trio went off to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small city soon after the evening dinner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the show they visited a confectioner's for a dish</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ice cream where Bellant monopolized the attention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alice and in every way held the center of the girl's in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jameson pondered: was he, he wondered quite sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, really jealous? Such a thought had never entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head before, but as the idea filtered in and about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, he became suddenly conscious that he felt a</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuine affection for this student he had taught. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had flowered out so much during the summer--had liter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally grown up from a college girl to a young woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At return to the farm, Jameson agreed to get together</seg><seg type="columnLine">a set of data for Bellant to take with him that evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his return home. In the meantime, Bellant said he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Alice would stroll about the yard in the moonlight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jameson hurried through the drawings and notes he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">copying for Bellant and in half an hour went outside in</seg><seg type="columnLine">search of the couple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He called softly, but had no reply. A thorough search</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the yard disclosed no sign of the two, and Harry was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a loss as to where to find them. Suddenly he heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a voice raised in mild protest. It was Alice speaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Please don't; Mr. Bellant!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The voice came from the summer house down the lane</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the wooded part of the farm. Again the protest</seg><seg type="columnLine">came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I asked you to stop."</seg><seg type="columnLine">54</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">\</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I love you, girl," Jameson heard Bellant say in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very low voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nonsense!'' replied Alice. "You've only just met</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Anyway, I am not sure I like you--I know I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">not if you insist on annoying me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silence ensued, and Harry debated whether he should</seg><seg type="columnLine">intrude or simply wait for them to return from the sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer house. The final outcry decided him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Allen Bellant! If you touch me again, I shall go in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leave you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harry was off like a streak. The girl was being an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noyed, and Harry was certain now that his interest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alice was at least more than casual. As Jameson arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the summer house where the moonlight filtered</seg><seg type="columnLine">through in black lace and silver, Bellant stepped up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alice, took her in his arms and attempted to kiss her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Bellant!" Alice cried in alarm, and then as if in</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeal and pleading to a protector, she called aloud,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Harry! Harry!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With an exaltation of soul and a thrill of greater joy</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he had ever known before, Jameson covered the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance between them in a bound, grasped Bellant by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, and whirled him back against the railing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crash. The physicist struck the low seat, tripped, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged headlong over the side to the grass below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, thank you, Harry," the girl cried softly as Jame-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son gathered her into one quick embrace. Unfortunately</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bellant had picked himself up just in time to see the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">in each other's arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So that's it, is it?" he half sneered. "Well, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I didn't know I was trespassing. I'm sorry if I caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">you any worry, old man, but I completely lost my head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Too much moonlight I guess."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your drawings and data are in your car, Bellant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd rather not talk to you now. You'd better go. I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">look you up later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jameson spoke in a restrained voice, obviously holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in leash only by great effort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, I'll go. Don't forget though, I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">on that trip to Polaris with you. I rather suspect Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baldwin plans to go, too, doesn't she?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a queer little laugh Bellant left them, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard him slam his car door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man and woman stood quietly, side by side, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bellant made his retreat. Then as the car slipped away</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the distance, Harry turned to the girl and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, let's go in--not tonight. I--I don't trust myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. You were wonderful, and I want to think about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. I--I just called for you as if you belonged to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't I?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he started to speak again, Alice hushed him a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--not tonight. We are not ourselves right now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can't trust myself to judge sanely now. I'm too happy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet a little frightened, too. Take me in, Harry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was well past midnight when Jameson arose from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lonely seat on the porch and made his way to bed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmed at last, and infinitely happy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUST a year and a day had passed since the arrival</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cylinder from Polaris. During that time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete translation of the manuscript had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">made and directions for a space ship followed to com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last potato had been stowed away in the food</seg><seg type="columnLine">lockers. Ten years supply of condensed milk was aboard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Refrigerating rooms held hundreds of whole animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fresh meat supply. Thousands of small packages of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spices, teas, coffees, and condiments were stowed away</seg><seg type="columnLine">below. The enormous enameled water tank had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled, and the water purifiers and recoverers were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">place for work. Not a molecule of water should escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">from this ship once abroad in space. In the storerooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">were myriads of blocks of chocolate and various con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated foods. Huge slabs of compressed dehydrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">vegetables were stacked aside. Tons of dried fruits and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of cases of canned fruits filled one section.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barrels of lime juice occupied one refrigeration room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another was stacked with several tons of butter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">margarine. Each compartment was crammed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">limit. Everything that could possibly be needed was</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided, and a space found for it in this big ship which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was soon to sail the seas of space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night of June 21st was clear and cloudless. About</seg><seg type="columnLine">the completed ship were hundreds of tents. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big night, and many people were there to witness</seg><seg type="columnLine">the take-off of the ship. Many had come to witness what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they termed "the big flop." They did not believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship would actually "fly." Others were there to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greatest event in history take place. A delegation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists from foreign nations arrived about ten o'clock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The members of the expedition or Interstellar League</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all established in their apartments. All told, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were twenty-six scientists; three ladies, including Alice</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baldwin and two of the wives of the scientists. Besides</seg><seg type="columnLine">these there was a cook, two maids, and a steward. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">time of departure had been set for midnight, and every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one was excited. Even staid and elderly professors</seg><seg type="columnLine">paced the floor and nervously wished the ship was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her way. Relatives of the passengers were saying their</seg><seg type="columnLine">goodbyes, and wives were departing in tears as they left</seg><seg type="columnLine">their husbands for at least ten years--many firmly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved, forever. John Baldwin and his wife were visit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing calmly with Jameson and their daughter Alice. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the greatest blow would come when the huge ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually rose from the ground into space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside flares lighted the glade about the traveler</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sightseers sat patiently about waiting the exciting</seg><seg type="columnLine">event soon to take place. Some had built camp fires and</seg><seg type="columnLine">large shadows danced across the tree tops at the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cleared space in the woods. Everyone became more</seg><seg type="columnLine">restless as the time eased up toward midnight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At eleven fifty all but passengers were ordered off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. At eleven fifty-five the doors swung into place and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were sealed--no one knew for how long. The oxygen</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus was started and the purifiers started their</seg><seg type="columnLine">long grind of work. The port windows showed a glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light from within, and at one side where a small bulge</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred in the side of the ship, the astronomical instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments were being trained on Polaris with great care.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At one minute to twelve at a signal from within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, John Baldwin threw a switch on a nearby tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">which fired ten cannons that shot skyward flaring pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectiles. Long trails of green, red, blue, and golden rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell away behind these signals. The whole countryside</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a hundred miles was watching for this--telegraph</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires sang and radios flashed'the news abroad. It meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">the departure of the Earth for Polaris!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thirty seconds left! Big John stepped under the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the base, ignited a master fuse which led to six enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">COSMIC STEEPLE-CHASE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">55</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mous flares of magnesium metal on the base.

A shrill whistle split the air, and every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one in the glade started back as close to the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods as possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two seconds yet! A salute of three bombs shot up</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air and exploded with terrific concussions on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exact stroke of midnight, and on the second the space</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship swayed slightly, slowly rose like a balloon, and ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaining speed, fled out and up toward the pole star, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">flares lighting the whole land about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it shot up and away, a great shout arose from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">assembled group. Colored lights sprayed a rain of fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">and balls of red and green from the edges of the ether</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship that flashed out after the stars. The whole affair</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed a mass of colored lights and fire. This was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest celebration man had known for centuries--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fences of space were being hurdled and man rode the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steed that raced in the steeple-chase!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John Baldwin sobbed aloud and turned to his wife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her eyes were full of tears, but she uttered no sound.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Out into eternity two of their dearest and nearest ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailed--pioneers on the cosmic ocean of space!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T X OW perfectly absurd," laughed Alice Baldwin</seg><seg type="columnLine">I--I as she lifted a whole library table on one hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">*»■ -*■ and moved it across the side of the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Whatever can be the explanation of that, Harry?

The large space ship in which Alice and Harry</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood bore some twenty-eight other souls through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cosmic night on toward the Pole star, bound for the fifth</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet in the system of ten that had been found to.sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">round Polaris.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your strength has not increased, dear, except as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">think in terms of relativity.

Suffice it to say that the pedestal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this ship is loaded with a close relative of neutronium,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that mythical element made of condensed protons and</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrons. The gravity effected thereby, or the space</seg><seg type="columnLine">curving, is about half as great as earth itself. But let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget all that and dream of the future.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">nfark my words, before you know it, we'll have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">on our journey for a year."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean, Harry?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jordan Blake entered the room at that moment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused to listen to what Harry had to say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "According to our watches and the ship's log, about</seg><seg type="columnLine">three terrestrial years will elapse before we set foot on</seg><seg type="columnLine">land again--if we don't get annihilated between times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">However, you'll never believe it.

Once we reach the speeds</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching that of light, we begin to travel in the fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimension of space, we believe. The laws we so solemn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly pronounced correct as professors of physics and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mathematics do not seem to hold once we get off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. It would seem certain that we would be crushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the acceleration of this ship as it rushes faster and</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster. We are not subject to the same conditions here</seg><seg type="columnLine">as on earth--thus every molecule of the ship and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tents is 'pulled' equally along so there is no tendencj</seg><seg type="columnLine">for any part to 'flatten out' as we used to believe sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">high acceleration would treat organic bodies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Run along, Professor. I'll think it all over. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">must get your rest because we'll need you at your besl</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this trip."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE daily routine continued to be kept and as Alice</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken on the responsibility of keeping the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">and calendar for the party, it was she who an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced finally that they had been on their way some</seg><seg type="columnLine">two and a half years. Throughout this time the ship had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtled through space at the unimaginable speed of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">five million miles a second.</seg><seg type="columnLine">56</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mathematician in the party had long ago ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">to argue about the speed of the ship. For the first year</seg><seg type="columnLine">a constant effort had been made to bring theory and fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">together in figures and formulas showing that the speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">being attained was theoretically possible. Speeds greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">than light had always been conceived impossible, yet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts remained that they were making twenty-three times</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speed of light. The famous theory of Lorenz-Fitz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerald stating that as the speed of a body increased to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward that of light, the body contracted physically in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction of motion, did not seem to hold. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">much discussion and thought, the entire body of scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tists confirmed the opinion of Jameson that the ship must</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer be traveling in regular three dimensional space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whether the machine and its occupants had passed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a higher dimension was no longer problematical--it ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to be cold fact. In other words, Harry explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Alice, at the speed they had attained, they could no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer be bounded by three dimensional space, but had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become subject to the laws of another dimension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The first sign of trouble aboard appeared almost simul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneously with Alice's announcement that only six months</seg><seg type="columnLine">of earth time remained before the scheduled arrival at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Erb, the planet for which they were headed. For nearly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">year the physicist aboard, Allen Bellant, had been paying</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little too much attention to Alice, in the opinion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry Jameson. This was not at first annoying, but as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attentions became more and more insistent, Alice</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed great resentment and even spoke to Bellant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">assuring him that he was wasting his time. Apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">this meant nothing to the young scientist for he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued his personal favors and even increased his efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk to the girl. Admonitions by the older men in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party did not deter him and it was only after an open</seg><seg type="columnLine">breach of faith that Jameson finally forced himself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accost the young fellow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was while the greater portion of the ship's popula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was asleep that the first clash came. Alice had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">left Harry on watch for other space ships to return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her stateroom and was passing up through the darkened</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor when Allen Bellant suddenly stepped out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind a pillar and confronted her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh!" You startled me so, Mr. Bellant," the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped as she struggled to regain her composure. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no idea anyone was about."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So I surprised you, eh? Well, I guess I can get some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your favors, too. Why don't you give me a break?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've tried every way to interest you and you just give</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a cold stare. I tell you I love you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl recoiled from this outburst against the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ship, a half frightened expression on her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, don't try to high-hat me," resumed the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow, now entirely irrational. "I know what I'm say-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and I'm going to have you, see? I don't care how,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but get me, you'll be mine sooner or later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Bellant," cried the wrathful girl, fully herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, "I will ask you to stand aside and allow me to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my rooms. I don't care to discuss anything with you</seg><seg type="columnLine">and certainly pot in the ugly mood in which you now</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, you don't, don't you. Well, we won't need to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discuss it. I'll just take what I want and make you</seg><seg type="columnLine">like it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man strode forward suddenly and caught Alice</seg><seg type="columnLine">before she knew what was happening. With all her</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength, the girl fought off this half-crazed fellow, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">she was no match for his strength. Farther and farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">back he bent her, attempting to get the kiss he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">he should have. The girl's back was nearly broken and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head swam as she struggled to free herself. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a last effort she screamed aloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Harry! Harry!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damn you, you witch. I'll have you yet. Call your</seg><seg type="columnLine">lover, and see what good it does."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With this the young physicist dropped Alice where she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was and fled, only an instant before Jameson appeared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lower end of the corridor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Alice? Alice? Did you call?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jameson hurried up the dark hallway and did not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the girl before he tripped over her prostrate body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dear! Are you hurt? What was it? Tell me</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly!" he cried in tense but low tones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alice smiled weakly at him and shook her head, sink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing immediately into unconsciousness. Jameson lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">her quickly and took her to the rooms of his colleague,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith, whose wife was aboard. Shortly they had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vived the girl, and she sat up blinking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What was it, dear?" Harry pressed the question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I don't exactly remember," the girl faltered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Something large and black came to me and frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I'll be all right now, I guess. No, I'd rather go</seg><seg type="columnLine">back on watch with Harry. I'll feel safer there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After their return to the observatory, the girl confided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Jameson just what had occurred. For many minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">they discussed it, and after mature thought Harry arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went directly to Bellant's room to see the fellow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Better have it out at once Harry thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At Jameson's knock, the door was flung open by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">defiant and sullen Bellant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've nothing to say to you. I don't want to talk to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. You must think I'm dumb not to know what goes</seg><seg type="columnLine">on between you and that girl. Oh, don't look so right-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eous--I'm not blaming you any. I simply intend getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This tirade from the physicist was met in stony silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Jameson. The young astronomer's face was slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">whitening and becoming tense. Bellant noted this and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly fear entered his heart and a frightened look</seg><seg type="columnLine">flitted over his face. He tried to shut the door, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jameson flung it open, throwing the culprit to the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">within. Stepping inside, Harry closed and locked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bellant, I ought to whip you within an inch of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">life for those last remarks. What you infer is neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">true nor in any way justified by Miss Baldwin or myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gather that you said practically the same thing to Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baldwin. That is unforgivable. I came here to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuss this with you calmly. You meet me with vile in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinuations. I don't know that I am doing you a favor</seg><seg type="columnLine">by refraining from thrashing you good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time Bellant had fully recovered from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentary faint-heartedness, rose insolently, and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swagger faced Jameson, a leer and smirk twisting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">good-looking mouth into a half smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Trying to scare me out? Playing the hero? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">take that 'better than thou' attitude? Afraid I'll horn in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and take her away from you? Why man, I know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">lovely she is. You can't have her all yourself. As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">said before, I intend to get mine just as you are getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jameson went white. His body became tense, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed steel-blue sparks as he spoke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">COSMIC STEEPLE-CHASE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I warned you. I told you you were mistaken. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear this: you are a lying coward. I gave you the benefit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the doubt before. Now I'll give you something else."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a stride Jameson covered the distance between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and struck Bellant full on the jaw. Ordinarily, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow would have felled a larger man, but Bellant was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his toes and kept his senses, striking back with all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength. Back and forth they fought, around the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">upsetting tables, smashing chairs, tearing the drapes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">creating a fearful hub-bub. On their feet, now clinching</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rolling heavily about, gauging each other, pounding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strangling. It was the primitive beast in each man</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting for the possession of the one woman. On their</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet once more, the two circled cautiously. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jameson tripped on a torn rug, falling to one knee. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly Bellant rushed him, a broken chair leg upraised to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike. Jameson froze in his position, his body steeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to answer the instant command his mind was ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash. As Bellant towered above him, bringing the chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg down with terrific force toward Jameson's skull, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kneeling man flashed into action. His right fist shot up</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a bolt of lightning, his left shoulder caught the terri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble blow of the chair leg as he rose, the right fist catch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Bellant squarely under the chin and lifting him clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the floor. Without a grunt or a groan, the physicist</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailed through the air and alighted in a dishevelled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconscious heap. Jameson looked once at the fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and turned to go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Open this door!" shouted a voice outside, and some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one pounded heavily on the panels. Jameson went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, shot back the bolt and flung open the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is the meaning of this? What is this fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">about ? Who began the affair ?" A hundred questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ten people assembled outside the door fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly from their lips. Past them all Jameson strode,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning to answer only as he reached the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ask Bellant," he said and disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING the next six months very little was seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Bellant about the ship. He seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been completely cowed by the beating he had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived from Jameson. Most of the time the young phy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sicist spent in a private laboratory of his own which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fitted up before leaving Earth. What he was doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one knew, as he took no one into his confidence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the period of three years drew to a close, Bellant</seg><seg type="columnLine">was forgotten in the excitement of the approach to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">goal. Every hour brought the system of the Polaris</seg><seg type="columnLine">suns and planets closer and closer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day came when the entire system of four suns</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the accompanying ten planets was visible in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger of the telescopes. The primary set, Alpha with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its three units, seemed to be the center of the planetary</seg><seg type="columnLine">system. The secondary star, the ninth magnitude com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion of Alpha, seemed at an enormous distance from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the primary bodies and seemed to have little or no effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the planets. All three bodies in Alpha were excep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionally brilliant, and the pair which rotated as a sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dumb-bell shaped unit, end over end, were light blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a pink color respectively. The central body about</seg><seg type="columnLine">which this gyrating pair swung was a dazzling white--</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yellow like old Sol had been but pure, intense white.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was while engaged in observations on this system of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">suns that the discovery was made. Far ahead to the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">several of the party using low power telescopes noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">several odd black shapes. These increased from pin</seg><seg type="columnLine">points to definite dots in the space of a minute, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time took on a definite shape--long and thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">like wee dashes of black in space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately Jameson ordered the speed of the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship checked. Besides wishing to come up slowly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">these bits of matter, he thought it high time that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to the third dimension of space by cutting down</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormously on speed.. They were getting perilously near</seg><seg type="columnLine">their goal to travel at rates so excessive of normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">interplanetary speed. A slow approach would give time</seg><seg type="columnLine">for observation also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time the black dashes in space had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite shapes. They were much like black cigars in</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance now--very far off, but of definite shapes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore not stray matter in space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The first of our colleagues! I wonder from where</seg><seg type="columnLine">these space ships came. We will know soon now for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few days more will put us into yon system and down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our landing on Erb, the fifth planet of the system."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jameson talked with Alice considerably during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next few hours and the two were the first to discover</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship overtaking them from "behind," or properly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"below" them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately ten of the scientists donned space suits</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in groups of three or four went through the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">locks out on the hull of the space flyer to watch the over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking ship pass them. They took with them celestial</seg><seg type="columnLine">maps on which earth and old Sol were plainly indicated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If opportunity offered, these would be sent to the passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The small speck behind gradually grew to a sizable</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot, took on shape, and finally drew alongside the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyer. The newcomer was built in the form of a sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had no ports or windows'visible. It was made of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what looked like a glass with all the visual qualities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of earth's white metals. Several of the scientists</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once decided it must be made of a transparent metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some sort or else a specially hardened and colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jameson and the rest who went out on the hull</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved and signalled every type of code they thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">might even be noticed by the occupants of the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. As no doors or windows showed on the hull of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sphere, the earth men assumed that the hull of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship must be transparent, at least from within. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were unable to peer into the sphere from the earth ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By now the sphere ship had come to the same speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the earth flyer and by token of this Jameson reasoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the occupants of the stranger had recognized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth men as living beings. Suddenly a small section of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sphere swung inward on a hinge, and from within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the port thus formed, a small sphere floated out, followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by five more--a dull grey colored fabric body it appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be. These seemed to be propelled by small jets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaping gas under. pressure. One sailed over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth ship, circled above the heads of the men, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to its own ship. Suddenly, all of the fabric</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres rose and flashed over the intervening space be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the flyers, coming to rest on the hull of the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Jameson party gathered around the visitors and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were suddenly surprised to see a plate in one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fabric sides glow to light. On it came a diagrammatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">58</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">picture of the solar system. A pointer indicated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third planet, Earth, and a picture of a man appeared be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side it. Across the plate a way, the diagram indicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ninth planet of the solar system discovered by earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">men only a few years earlier. Beside this planet appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">a picture of a small sphere-like body with short ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendages--all covered with heavy scales. Suddenly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture became a movie--the sphere body pictured rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the diagram to the earth man and with a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument detached from its belt, sent a brilliant crim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son streamer at the man, blasting him to shimmering</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust. There followed in quick succession a movie of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two space flyers, and as the two approached the Polaris</seg><seg type="columnLine">system, the earth ship was pictured to turn tail and speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">away back toward earth. The plate darkened, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed a picture of the two ships approaching the Polaris</seg><seg type="columnLine">system closely. Suddenly the spherical ship flashed side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise and crashed into the earth ship which it burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">asunder, and passed on through unharmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The plate went black, and with a quick jerk the six</seg><seg type="columnLine">fabric spheres rose from the earth ship. Swiftly swoop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in an arc, these spheres struck down six of the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">party and streaked out for their own ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A declaration of war!" shouted Jameson. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to be the sole representatives at the conclave at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Erb. That scene shows them to be from the ninth planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Sol--the one discovered a few years ago. So little</seg><seg type="columnLine">is known about it that we were unable to tell if it was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all habitable. These beings must be able to stand terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat changes. Probably there is no liquid in their make-</seg><seg type="columnLine">up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the moment Jameson was violently bumped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind and as he whirled to see what had hit him, a piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of paper suddenly materialized in the void before him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and floated toward the deck. As he reached for it, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quickly bowled over and thrown along the deck. Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated efforts to see what had hit him disclosed nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all--all his colleagues were twenty feet from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaining his feet quickly, Jameson recovered the paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had so mysteriously appeared before him. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened up, he was surprised to note a luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail streaking out from the earth ship to the sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the declared enemy. The fabric spheres of the enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">were preparing to enter their ship as this luminous streak</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached them. Suddenly these spheres were thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly to one side and the trail of faint purple dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared into the circular opening in the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere. Quickly the fabric spheres crowded into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening and the circular door swung into place, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">a perfectly smooth surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jameson hurried to the entrance lock of his own ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plugged in his microphone to the interior speaker</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get Bellant for me quick. He may be able to explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of this light phenomena to us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've been trying to find him for five minutes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't locate him. His clothes are gone and so are all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">note books and valuables. We have had something</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong with the air-locks just now too--they opened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed by themselves for no apparent reason. You had</seg><seg type="columnLine">better come in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. This answer was rather stunning but Jameson was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not one to linger when cold facts might be available</seg><seg type="columnLine">within. Suddenly the paper in his hand caught his eye;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he remembered the bowling over he had just received--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked quickly at the enemy sphere. It was rapidly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">moving ahead. Jameson began to think quickly. Bellant</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone; locks operated by themselves; he had been knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">about; a trail of purple haze to the spherical flyer; a note</seg><seg type="columnLine">materializing from mid-air. Hastily he turned and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly through the air locks into the flyer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Call Alice Baldwin on the general news speaker," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">commanded as he doffed his space suit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sorry, Jameson, but we've been trying to locate her</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the past ten minutes. Mrs. Smith was wishing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak with her. We've searched the whole ship--even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the store rooms. It's very strange, what with both Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bellant and Miss Baldwin disappearing at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was enough to crystallize the vague ideas Jameson</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been framing in his mind. He ripped open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">folded paper he had recovered out on the hull of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!" Jameson was not profane, but spoke as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if in prayer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it, Harry?" Jones queried as he took off</seg><seg type="columnLine">his space suit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That infernal Bellant! He has left this ship for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy sphere--and lie's abducted Alice with him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">created the strange path of purple haze from us to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other flyer. Where is the sphere ? We must catch it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too late, Harry. The sphere is already out of sight."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones was not consoling in the least.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then start immediately for Erb. We must obtain</seg><seg type="columnLine">the help of our hosts in finding that rascal Bellant and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my fiancee Alice. I will search the Universe for them if</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are absurd, Jameson." Smith spoke. "It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be impossible for Bellant to get from our ship to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy sphere without us seeing him, not to speak of</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking with him an active girl like Alice without our</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is where you are wrong, Smith," countered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jameson. "Listen to this note: 'It is brains, not brawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">that win. You can best appreciate the saying "mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">over matter" by trying to find me--or your ex-sweet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. She's mine now.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I alone know what Bellant has been working on in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the past six months. For months this young man--</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant in spite of his corrupt morals--has been work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on a physico-chemical method of obtaining a complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisibility for himself and all material or persons near</seg><seg type="columnLine">him should he so desire. Very apparently he had accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plished his end and has used his discovery to cover his</seg><seg type="columnLine">abduction of Alice and his flight to the enemy ship. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">he expects to be received, I do not know.

As the flyer rushed up to the ten planets</seg><seg type="columnLine">above, Jameson cut down the speed until once again the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyer was rushing through three dimensional space at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparatively slow speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the ship was in the general plane of the ecliptic</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all Polaris' planets and turned inward in search of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifth planet Erb. Off to the left was the farthest flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet--the outpost of the Polarian space travelers. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">it passed the seventh planet, glorious in its crescent form</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it reflected the light of its parent suns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Erb! I see it! Slow down--we will have to go care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully to avoid sliding past. We can't land at this speed!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even as Jameson spoke, a giant space liner flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">past them headed for the planet. Everyone who could,</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed this speeding craft through glasses and tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scopes. Onward it fled--in ten minutes it approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">Erb. Now it slowed down and swept in a far flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiral curve, on past the planet and back and around it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever approaching closer. After swinging completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the planet three times, each time coming closer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the liner entered the atmosphere and slowed perceptibly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slanting down toward the surface of the giant sphere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally it disappeared around the sphere, and apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed on the other side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll try it--more speed." Jameson took charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the controls, and the earth flyer took a dive into its first</seg><seg type="columnLine">big swing in the spiral about the planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Erb seemed to spin before them as the space ship spun</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the sphere. Down anil down they went, at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">entering the atmosphere. The ship's hull glowed to a red</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it flashed through the air. The interior of the flyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew very warm and Jameson called for a check in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. At last they were over the planet's surface and</seg><seg type="columnLine">below them was the great landscape they had expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see--orange colored foliage with some few sprinklings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of green here and there. A group of peculiar buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed beneath them. They whirled over an enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea--nearly a quarter the way about the planet this</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of water extended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The capital!" shouted one of the observers, and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were focused off to the right where thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings appeared--all colors, tall and round, thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. The ship veered around and sailed over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city in the very middle of which lay an enormous open</seg><seg type="columnLine">field on which could be seen hundreds of ships, many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which appeared to be like the earth ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down to this field the men of earth floated, the voyage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of three years through cosmic night coming to an end</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a scarcely perceptible jar as the ship settled on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedestal base.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spontaneously the thirty travelers from earth burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a cheer and a rush was made for the doors in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower part of the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before opening up, however, careful tests were made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of outside pressure, temperature, humidity, and atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pheric composition. Though low in oxygen and high in</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperature the atmosphere was found to be livable and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with great joy the men and women of earth descended</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground, the first for three long years. The high</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">barometric pressure of the air caused some difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first but soon the earth party was breathing well. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous size of the planet caused the gravity pull to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be exceedingly large, and it was with great difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the party advanced to the center of the large field</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a reception committee awaited respectfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before a word or greeting was exchanged, the Erbians</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered strange shoe-like apparatus, and Jameson being</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leader, tried these on. Instantly the terrific gravity</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull was relieved and the Professor quickly urged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest to get on a pair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Greetings, men of Earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not a word had been spoken, but the message came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to every man sharp and clear. For the first time Jame-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son and his party became aware that the Erbians were</seg><seg type="columnLine">much like earth men--the figure was much the same,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the size being slightly larger, and although there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">minor differences, the bodies of these sons of Polaris</seg><seg type="columnLine">were very much like those of Jameson and the rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The star Sol sends Erbians his blessings and saluta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions through his children, men of Earth. We are here</seg><seg type="columnLine">at your call, and come in peace."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jameson bowed low with these words, not in subjuga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion but in full recognition and respect of the Erbians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Erbian hears and understands you. He does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not speak vocally, but makes his meaning clear to you by</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. Welcome to Erb, and may our planet give you</seg><seg type="columnLine">a comfortable home while you are here. Please bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">your party to the building yonder. All of your effects</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be transferred for you from your ship to your home</seg><seg type="columnLine">while here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The entire party was conducted to a beautiful building</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the right of the field, and each assigned to a separate</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment of five rooms. Every room had a special me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanical servant, each of which had been designed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">respond to commands of the visitors. Not one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth party ever did obtain a full understanding of how</seg><seg type="columnLine">these servants were constructed and operated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the earliest opportunity a conference was held be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the leaders of the Erbians and Jameson with Jor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dan Blake and a few others chosen to act as executive</seg><seg type="columnLine">.committee. Immediately Jameson laid before these men</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Erb the falsity of Bellant, and the war-like attitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fabric sphere beings from the ninth solar planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">encountered in space, when Bellant had abducted Alice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Assistance was asked in locating this ship and a warrant</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the arrest of the entire crew was issued by Alkad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presiding officer of the Erbians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Magnetic messages were relayed to every planet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">satellite in the system, including the outpost planet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the penal or corrective satellites, setting watchers on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alert for this space ship. It was apparently the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one made in a spherical shape, for the Erbians had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">used such a shaped flyer for centuries of their time. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">would make it easy to recognize as most other flyers com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in were shaped much like the earth ship or long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylindrical. As a final help, ten police ships were ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">abroad to patrol the interplanetary space of the system</seg><seg type="columnLine">to try to locate the war-like vessel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For ten days of the Erbian time (about forty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth hours) the earth men were kept busy learning all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the conference next to be held. Twenty days were</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet to elapse before the conference of the Universe was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to start. Earth men were among the last to arrive as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were from one of the most far flung systems repre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented in the conclave. Many beings were represented</seg><seg type="columnLine">60</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">here on Erb. The surprising thing to the earth men was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the similarity of all reasoning beings in the physical form</seg><seg type="columnLine">although some were certainly peculiar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It seems that the Creator has a very definite set of</seg><seg type="columnLine">laws of evolution over his entire cosmic group of Uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verses," the leader of the Erbians explained at a group</seg><seg type="columnLine">conference. "There is a Variation in the detail in most</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases, but the basic principles are all the same. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal world, the planet, and the mineral world all go</seg><seg type="columnLine">through certain stages of evolution. There will be at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this conference almost every stage of the evolution of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three types of life I have mentioned. I will see to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you all get a chance to see your inferiors and su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periors--although frankly, you earth beings are nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the bottom of the scale that will be represented here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mineral life! I say, that's new to me," observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith to Jameson. "I wonder what such a being would</seg><seg type="columnLine">look like."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I believe it's the key to the life we saw in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fabric spheres from the enemy space flyer. Why, oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">why don't we hear some word of that ship. I tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm nearly wild in spite of my outward calm! Wrhat has</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to Alice? Where is she? What has Bellant</seg><seg type="columnLine">done with her? Oh, if only these police ships w'ould lo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate the sphere, I'd go out and get it myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leader, Alkad, continued with his explanation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stages of physical and mental evolution. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that certain types developed mentally more than physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally and others just the reverse. The moral develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment was largely dependent in the environment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of development.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually Jameson lost interest in the very interesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussion, and at last arose and left the conference. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed directly for the earth space ship. On his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was intercepted by a messenger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Harry Jameson? The police have sighted the sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship you desire to capture. They lost it as it went out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our system. We do not police space beyond our system."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What types of weapons do you have which I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">use myself? Jameson inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was informed that a special car had been con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed for police duty during this conclave of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Universe. It was just completed with the latest devices</seg><seg type="columnLine">for capturing an enemy or for annihilating him. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship the messenger offered for Jameson's use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two entered an air rocket and were thrown high</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the upper atmosphere of the planet where the rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">could travel without much friction and at prodigious</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. A three hour flash through the upper air brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">them a quarter the way about the planet where they de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended and made a landing in a large metal recoil net</seg><seg type="columnLine">which eased off the shock of the stop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A short trip in a surface car driven by a reaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor brought the pair to the police yards. Here they</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the new space police ship. Very small it was, big</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough only for three men, but in it were masses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery. The whole was not more than thirty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">across.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ship had several observation windows about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumference. On six different sides, equidistant one</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the other, were six powerful ray projectors--all</seg><seg type="columnLine">were paralyzing rays and designed to put out of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission all machinery in the path of the ray. All liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing material, also would be paralyzed by these rays.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inside the ship was a powerful attractor. Any object</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was focused in the field of the attractor would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be held fast and hard in any definite position desired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The mechanism for controlling and driving the ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as the controls of speed, position, a magnetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio communication with the central station of Erb, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the controls of the rays and attractors, were all located</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a large control board directly in front of an operator's</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable seat. As a crowning glory, a section of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship was devoted to machinery producing about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyer a protective shield through which no heat rays or</seg><seg type="columnLine">any known rays or missiles could pass. This made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship impregnable and assured the positive capture of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship or body the flyer might take after. As to speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no known method for obtaining a higher speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the police car could attain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Needless to say, Jameson was delighted. After an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour of instruction in operation and control, he selected</seg><seg type="columnLine">two helpers and with no word other than a registration</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the police records for outbound space ships, flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up through the atmosphere of Erb out into the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">night of Polaris interplanetary space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Erbian police ship under the hand of Jameson</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot out into space at right angles to the plane of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ecliptic of the planets of Polaris. Somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">in space close about this system lurked a spherical space</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship now outlawed by its refusal to comply with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">demands of the police ship which had sighted it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">commanded it to land immediately on Erb. The task of</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding this speck of matter in the vast ocean of dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">void seemed colossal to the two helpers in the flyer with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jameson, but the young professor seemed not to realize</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enormous chances of missing what he was searching</seg><seg type="columnLine">for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the space car swung in a giant arc covering a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half billion miles, allowing observation of the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polaris system of planets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After a swing back again, searching vainly over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space on the one side of the planetary plane or "ecliptic,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jameson flashed his car up through the system barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">missing two of the outer satellites of one of the planets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now on the outer side of the planetary system he again</seg><seg type="columnLine">began the search for the dot that would indicate the goal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his search.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three billion miles of arcs in many directions re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed no trace of the enemy sphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Might as well return to Erb I guess," sighed Jame-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. "There isn't a sign of them out here. They must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone a long way out into space to wait for a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to slip in on some little inhabited planet or satellite."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Pardon, Professor, but what is that speck ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us heading for *he outer-most planet of our system?</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is very little on that planet but snow and ice--</seg><seg type="columnLine">our men there live in air-tight heated buildings."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure enough!--the outlaw ship. All the speed we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have, boys! Let's get them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Remember your proximity to the planets, Professor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Full speed would put you through the system in about</seg><seg type="columnLine">two seconds."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This caution from his helper prevented Jameson from</seg><seg type="columnLine">applying too much speed at this critical time and helped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to steady him to the task of overtaking the outlaw un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. With a careful hand on the controls, the police car</seg><seg type="columnLine">.swept in a vast arc down towards the wee black dot</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an effort to approach the outlaw from behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">COSMIC STEEPLE-CHASE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">61</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">planet and surprise it before it could escape. A chase</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into space was not what they wanted. Once within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few miles ol the sphere, Jameson knew he could apply</seg><seg type="columnLine">the force of the attractors and literally drag the helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy to Erb where a full accounting could be had.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a terrific speed Jameson drove his new car at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet where they knew the outlaw to be preparing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">land. Closer now, almost upon the planet, the police car</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed. With a rush Jameson brought his ship about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve of the planet and immediately sighted the enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to land some thousand miles away. Apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">they observed Jameson's car at the same instant for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere of glass-like metal dropped toward the ragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow-covered mountains of the planet like a plummet--</seg><seg type="columnLine">much too rapidly to be safe for the occupants Jameson</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Help watch for them. Use that electric magnifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescope for me, please," commanded the Professor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his helpers. "We must not lose them among this rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">country of crags, caves, and hollow mountains."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over the spot believed to have been the point where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sphere had dropped to the surface, the police car</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled, each of the three occupants searching the land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scape for evidence of the outlaw. Suddenly a streamer</seg><seg type="columnLine">of brilliant red cut through the semi-darkness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere from beneath a rough mountain crag--just</seg><seg type="columnLine">missing Jameson's ship by a few feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whee! That was close. Careless of me to forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own protection. Turn on that generator for me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">will you please?" Jameson spoke quickly and the per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiration stood out on his forehead in beads as the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">actionary nervous shock set in. He had certainly allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his men to come near to death. The heat ray from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy would have fused the windows of the police</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship easily had it struck home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the protective shield about them, the members</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Jameson's party proceeded quickly to the attack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down they dropped and began the maneuvering which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they hoped would cause the sphere to make known its</seg><seg type="columnLine">exact location. Around the great crags and deep valleys</seg><seg type="columnLine">the police car sailed, hoping to draw the fire of the enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thus locate the hiding spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once again the red ray flashed out at the police ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the three occupants cried in triumph as they spotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sphere of the outlaws lurking in a deep recess be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the mountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fire at them with our paralyzing ray--quickly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore they move--over there, see?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The helpers saw and had the ray in operation before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jameson ceased to speak. The red heat ray of the ene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">my stabbed out once more, turning harmlessly aside as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it struck the protecting energy-wall about the police car.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The paralyzing ray sought and met this red ray; a blind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing shower of sparkling flashes followed, and suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red ray ceased to be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The attractor, quickly--get them as they are and hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Sight first and get them in focus; then switch on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the current to hold them. I will pilot us back to Erb</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drag them with us," cried Jameson excitedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ready--shoot! or they'll escape. There, that's fine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, hold on to them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a triumphant gesture, the Professor sent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police car speeding up and away in a sweeping arc for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Erb. dragging the unwilling outlaw with him. Beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">after beam of heat ray, dis-ray, and explosive ray were</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed at her captor by the sphere, all to be turned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">aside by the protective shield that surrounded the police</seg><seg type="columnLine">car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they neared Erb, the helpers in the police car held</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sphere bathed, in paralyzing rays to prevent these</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlaws from raying the people or buildings on Erb.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly they settled to the ground in the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing field and squads of armed officers surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outlaw sphere, ray guns in hand. At last Jameson</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared from the police car and ordered the enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship cut open. This was hazardous for it meant the use</seg><seg type="columnLine">of electronic knives and should one of these slip slightly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the occupants of the ship might suffer. Too dear an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividual was believed to be in this ship to take great</seg><seg type="columnLine">risks, so Jameson ordered very thin slices cut away each</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the outlaws observed their ship being cut to pieces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they apparently decided that to surrender peacefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be the safest course; and before great damage was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done, a section of the hull opened and out sailed a sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing a white flag.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Surrender!" came the command from Jameson, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sphere with the white flag dipped in recognition and</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquiescence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand by with your air police ready to stop any</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempts at escape or reprisals," ordered Jameson to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Erbian officers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the spherical ship came sphere after sphere, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing a white flag. At last no more emerged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jameson felt sure all the sphere beings were emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">but somewhere in the ship were hidden two earth people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Search the ship. I will lead. One of the spheres</seg><seg type="columnLine">must proceed us in our search to protect us from a trap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Please do not come, Alkad. There may be danger and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you should not expose yourself. This is our dispute, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">let us settle it as best we can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jameson spoke to his Erbian friend earnestly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started toward the outlaw ship followed by Erbian police</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one or two of his own party.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait! I shall avoid exposing either yourself or my</seg><seg type="columnLine">men," Alkad spoke sharply. "We possess a type of ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine which will do this investigating for us. Elam,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he called to one of his escort and communicated some</seg><seg type="columnLine">message to his kinsman. This individual nodded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried away on a rocket sled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have just completed a sort of robot which will do</seg><seg type="columnLine">this investigating for us. The machine sees, hears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smells, and to a certain limit feels, or reacts to physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch stimuli. We may note all these things through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">separate receiver out here--a sort of radio transmission</seg><seg type="columnLine">you would call it. Here comes Elam with the robot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">receiver now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon the marvelous robot was inside the ship, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolled from the receiver by electric impulse. Watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">and listening at the receiver, Harry Jameson excitedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave commands for directing the robot. Now they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see through the robot's eyes and hear through its ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interior scenes and noises of the ship. Down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body of the ship they seemed to go. A scream</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached their ears, and the robot halted, tried the knob</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a door near him, and waited for orders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Break the door down," came the command, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">robot charged the panel, shattering it to bits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Alice!" shouted Harry as the robot's eyes registered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scene before it. Alice sat bound to a sort of chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and over her leaned Bellant, frozen in the act of reach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward the helpless girl. The sight of the giant robot</seg><seg type="columnLine">62</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of shinning metal seemed to paralyze him with fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Harry is outside to rescue you. He will kill your</seg><seg type="columnLine">tormentor," Jameson heard the robot enunciate with</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty to the man and woman on whom its electrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes gazed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick, have the robot seize Bellant before it is too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late," shouted Jameson to the operator at his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The robot strode one step forward, and then hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated. The operator at Jameson's side asked quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Bellant was--he did not know and had had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitate to find which the robot should seize.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The man--please be quick," replied Harry in</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiety. Too well he knew what might happen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apparently Bellant took the situation in clearly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outset, and seeing the robot hesitate, he stepped back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a table, picked up something, and with a throwing</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement, stepped quickly close to Alice and stooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward her, arms outstretched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as Harry saw this and cried out the pair of hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mans before the robot suddenly faded from view--</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished completely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bellant's invisibility robe," gasped the young astrono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer. "Move the robot forward quickly. Follow any</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail of violet luminosity. Bellant is escaping with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alice!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The operator of the robot seemed nonplused and</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to comprehend Jameson's full meaning. Instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of moving the robot forward instantly, he turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry for further direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quickly!" groaned Jameson. "Rush the robot for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, arms outstretched. Follow any violet colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">trails in the air. Oh, please act--do something!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The operator jumped into action and the robot ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, arms outstretched. Despite turning and mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing about the room, not a single solid object did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">robot encounter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's too late. Bring the robot out here. We'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to search for Bellant somewhere else. He is gone with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the moment out from the sphere came a rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving air sled with apparently no one on it. Behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sled a violet haze streamed. Not an individual no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticed this until the sled was well launched into the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">and streaking away at an ever increasing speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Police! After that sled!" commanded Alkad as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicated the rapidly dwindling form of the sled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly a dozen special speed sleds flashed up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaked out after the fugitive. Alkad and Jameson</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung .themselves flat on a new sled and the driver ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied the power. With a scarcely perceptible thrust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sled carried its passengers forward at a speed un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known in earthly atmospheric travel. Alkad estimated</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Jameson that they were traveling at a speed of about</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred miles per hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll overtake them shortly. There isn't an air sled</seg><seg type="columnLine">made that can equal these in speed," Alkad commented.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"See the police ahead of us? They'll catch your man</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fugitive sled was again in full sight as the police</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleds gained on it, and Jameson leaned forward as if to</seg><seg type="columnLine">help the sled along. Closer now they swept, the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">.screaming past their windshield with a shrill note.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ten minutes chase brought the police sleds upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleeing vehicle and as Alkad's conveyance pulled up over</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, the cordon of the law drew tightly about Bellant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With no warning whatever Bellant literally dropped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his sled on a steep decline toward the mountainous re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gion below them. Immediately the police dived after</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but the sudden change in direction ef Bellant had</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the police sleds unawares, and they were miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the spot Bellant first dropped before they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank on a turn and drop quickly after him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time the pursuers were well down on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">descent, Bellant's sled was down among the peaks. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbelievable skill the fugitive zig-zagged through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crags and peaks of this rugged range covered with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubby orange colored growth of dwarfed trees. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleds of the law rapidly dropped toward the sharp peaks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the great gorges below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The foremost police sled dived almost vertically into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great gorge into which Bellant had sped. Rapidly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuer gained on Bellant. Now he was over him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently ordering him to halt. An instant later a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash of jagged lightning bolted upward from Bellant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sled of the law. With a loud detonation the pursu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sled, officer, and machinery disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the flash of the detonation, Bellant's sled dived</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the shadow of the deep canyon below and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A full hour's search T5y all the police cordon failed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reveal a trace of the outlaw. A conference down in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool depths of the great gorge led to a decision to return</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the city. The whole fleet rose as one and streaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">away through the blue of the Erbian sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON return to the city at last, Jameson took time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">observe what surroundings he had on this new</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet. With the assurance of Alkad that not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment should elapse without a police cordon on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">search for Bellant and Alice, the young astronomer gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attention to the coming conclave, mainly because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt it a duty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were representatives from over a thousand dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent systems. Many forms of organic life were repre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented. The earth representatives were about the low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est in the scale of the animal life represented and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth man, the type went on up, some individuals be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing highly developed mentally--eons ahead of earth men</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and some developed physically to the highest degree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The intellectual giants were very similar to the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in appearance, although their reasoning power was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the comprehension of the earth men. The phys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical progress in animals had resulted in all sorts of odd</seg><seg type="columnLine">developments. For the most part the body was smaller,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the appendages were much shortened and all use-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less parts were eliminated. The head had enlarged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">most cases and the appendages of locomotion were nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone because of the lack of use as the beings developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanical locomotion to a higher degree. Plant life</seg><seg type="columnLine">was represented as well as the animal. Over a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred of the guests of the Erbians were of plant origin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although the men of Earth soon learned that distinctions</seg><seg type="columnLine">between plant, animal, and mineral life were really mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters of degree rather than kind. Most of the plant life</seg><seg type="columnLine">used a rolling motion of the body to propel itself from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one place to another. The bodies were of regular cel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lulose structure but highly complex, with many special</seg><seg type="columnLine">tissues never found in earthly plant life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Very prominent among the visiting types of life were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "mineralites" as Smith soon dubbed them. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">COSMIC STEEPLE-CHASE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">63;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were individuals whose body was composed of crystals</seg><seg type="columnLine">of minerals. Most of the higher types were built up</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thousands of minute crystals of many colors, glow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with light as a rule. Presumably the individuals</seg><seg type="columnLine">multiplied by enlarged growth and division or in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same general fashion as the earthly hydra reproduces</seg><seg type="columnLine">--by simple "budding" of a new individual at one part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Jameson and his party were conveyed about by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alkad and his men, they were shown many delightful</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces of cultural art--drawings, pottery, and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">sculpture work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon they were conveyed to a part of the planet where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sciences were studied and because of their interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in astronomy, Jameson and a few of his fellowmen were</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown the electronic telescope through which Old Sol</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the nine planets and asteroids had been detected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not alone were there great physical, chemical, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">biological laboratories but in as great proportion the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Erbians had schools devoted to the study of psychology,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of geology, and of the general best ways of living. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a slave of their science whereby they provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">by its means the necessary machines, robots, and elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trical and chemical devices to completely free them of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all drudgery and necessity for "making a living." Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the Erbians had a chance to select a branch of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligence he liked best, while going through his pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liminary training, and after his general education was</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete, he devoted the rest of his life to the problems</seg><seg type="columnLine">found in his field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here," said one of the guides during a trip through</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the advanced chemical research buildings, "is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">department devoted to the study of the constitution of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all matter. We believe everything is made from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">initial material--perhaps energy. We are attempting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to trace matter back to the beginning. Our greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds believe they are reaching a glimmering of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth. While we never expect to lift the veil of mystery</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounding creation, we do expect to be able to deduce</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of what is beyond the veil by the manifesta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of that beyond, which come to us as creations."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here was a very good sample of what the earth men</seg><seg type="columnLine">found most of the problems of Erbians to be--almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the limits of their imaginations. Jameson and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mates quickly divined that the little they knew of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge was as nothing compared to the least intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gent of the Erbians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I would like to inquire about the organic individuals</seg><seg type="columnLine">you sent to Earth in the cylinder you sent us. They are</seg><seg type="columnLine">a species found here?" Jameson put his question to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alkad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They were a type of intelligence which we developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for our own use. Literally they are organic thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines. Doubtless you of earth possess mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking machines--(calculators, slide rules, integrators)</seg><seg type="columnLine">which take much of the dry everyday grind out of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">complicated calculations. Just so do we have thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines, except that ours are organic and have a partial</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligence of their own. We developed this type of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life to aid us in the more simple lines of thought. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinkers may be educated to function in almost any in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tellectual field. Those sent to you were specially edu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated on space navigation, and all the necessary mechan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical and electrical knowledge necessary for this trip you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made. To be quite frank, we consider the thinkers</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be capable of quite as much real intelligence as any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of you earth men. The difference is that you are able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover many fields while a thinker is trained in one field</seg><seg type="columnLine">only."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "May we take a trip over the Polaris system of plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ets before the conclave begins?" requested Jameson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly. I will give you a guide and you may use</seg><seg type="columnLine">your own ship. You will be allowed to land on every</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet except the innermost of our system. The elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tronic equipment there is too delicate to allow anyone to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come closer than ten thousand miles unless specially</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained in that field. Our specialists spend centuries in</seg><seg type="columnLine">study before they are allowed even a preliminary visit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the power-sphere as we call it. Elam, will you con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duct the Earth party and ship about our system? Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn in fifteen days. We shall then begin our conclave."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With no more ado the party returned to the space</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship in which they had come from earth and began the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tour of the system. For many days they went from</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet to planet, visiting the more interesting parts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">each, until at last only the outermost planet remained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was the planet which was so cold and on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Erbians existed only when protected by great heated</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome buildings. It was only after much persuasion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">their guide took them to this faraway place. Fortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was that the Earth men insisted on seeing this ice-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered sphere for had they not, Bellant would doubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less have remained at large for all time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they descended on the planet, guided by Elam's</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction, they were able to look down into one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great glass-domed buildings, and were surprised to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">there the great glass-like ball of the space ship owned</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the sphere bodies from the solar system. Guided by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elam, the Earth ship dropped carefully through an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened dome and after closing the dome above them, at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendants in the form of mechanical robots guided the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship to one side, and anchored it securely. Opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">great ovenlike heaters, the robots warmed the large</seg><seg type="columnLine">building up to normal again after the penetrating cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the outside. When air conditions were adjusted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the temperature was endurable, upon a signal from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small house at one side, the robots opened the flyer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">allow the Earth men to emerge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An Erbian came from the small house to greet them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Immediately upon questioning by Elam, the Erbian ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted he was housing an unregistered space ship in</seg><seg type="columnLine">another building, but said the ship had claimed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming into the Polaris system from the Solar system</seg><seg type="columnLine">--had wished to stop for repairs and supplies. He im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately agreed to conduct the party to the other build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing where Jameson felt sure he would find Alice and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bellant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before boarding a peculiar platform with the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">party, the Erbian gave directions by a telepathic thinker</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the spherical space ship and all occupants were to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">held till he arrived. The thinker, it seemed, was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">specialized telepathy unit and could easily transmit a</seg><seg type="columnLine">message or mental image to a similar thinker in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other building. With a final direction to a second thinker,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Erbian boarded the platform and announced that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were about to go into the fourth dimension for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief interval. In that dimension they could safely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily go "beyond" the intervening rock and ice into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other building just as an airplane can easily go "over"</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a field surrounded by a very high fence. The plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">needs only to rise from two dimensions into the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimension, travel over the obstacle and drop down safely</seg><seg type="columnLine">64</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other side back into the second dimension. Solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects offered no more resistance when traversed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fourth dimension than a fence offers when hurdled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by means of ascent into the third dimension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each one held his breath as the platform started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move. There was only the sensation of a sort of slip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping motion--no particular direction, but each felt he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was moving somewhere. Then the solid walls, rock,Jce,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and snow all appeared to be half transparent. It was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they were looking both at the solid objects and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side them at the same time. The whole scene, from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth space ship clear to the enemy sphere ship, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly before them, including all the rock and ice be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the buildings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a swirling-like feeling the earth men came to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden slipping stop and once more the walls were solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the building opaque.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately Jameson sprang to the floor and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the enemy spheres. He was stopped by the Erbian</seg><seg type="columnLine">in charge of the great domed building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will wait until your guide advises me as to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">status here," the Erbian communicated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are here to arrest those individuals in the sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. They are outlaws. W hy haven't you notified Erb</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this? The police have been looking everywhere for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this ship--haven't you had the messages?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Erbian conferred with Elam and it was a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious group which approached the silent sphere ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the outlaws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bellant, come out and bring Alice with you," Jameson</seg><seg type="columnLine">called loudly at the open door of the space flyer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no response for a moment, and then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of the ship flew shut suddenly, the ship rose quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after circling a moment headed directly for the glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome above. If it struck the great arch and broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, all in the room below would perish from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden chill of the outside atmosphere. Besides that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tons of glass would shower down on them, cutting every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to ribbons. There was no time to run for shelter--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sphere ship was half way to the top and ever gain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing speed. Twenty seconds and it would crash through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dome out toward space. The Erbians both shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud, saying a certain set of vowels quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly in response to the vocal call of the Erbians</seg><seg type="columnLine">six great robots about the building flashed into action,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepping to a beam transmitter as a man, throwing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power switch, and training the ray on the escaping ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">in less time than it required to shout the command.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fugitive swirled drunkenly about and careened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one side but continued to rise, ever more slowly. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays had paralyzed the machinery and any life in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere. Still the ship rose, and the men below became</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious for fear the big ball would crash through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome from the momentum it had gained. At last the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatal second came--would the dome hold against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">impact of the slowly moving ship?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a resounding crash the big glass-like ship struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dome top and rebounded as a rubber ball from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snap of the elastic give in the dome structure. A shower</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fine glass rained over the rebounding sphere and slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">off to flitter down to the floor. Only a few individuals</seg><seg type="columnLine">were cut and so great was the joy at the capture of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlaw that no one minded the slight injuries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Erbian in charge immediately dispatched a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">robots with glass squares to repair the damage done to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dome, and with a powerful attractor he pulled the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere to the floor. The door was pried open, and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side went Jameson and half a dozen others, ray pistols</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strange to say not a sphere body could be seen. Later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they learned that Bellant had stolen back to the landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">field on Erb and appropriated the space traveler with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out permission. A long search disclosed Bellant with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alice in a tiny cubby hole at the base of the ship where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had hoped to escape detection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come out, Bellant," ordered Jameson, and the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dued physicist obeyed without a word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turning the culprit over to two of his men, Jameson</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up the unconscious form of Alice and tenderly</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried her outside. It was with great eagerness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry waited while the Erbian administered a stimu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lating drug to bring Alice out of her unconsciousness. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">full ten minutes elapsed and the first faint fluttering of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyelids brought Harry to her side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Darling, are you all right?" the young astronomer</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried. "It is Harry--you are safe at last. No longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall Bellant torture you. Speak to me, dear."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The girl tried to speak, but only made strange gurgling</seg><seg type="columnLine">noises. Another attempt brought better results. Alice</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered that she was only very weak from lack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">food and water. It seemed that Bellant had failed to lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a supply of the two necessities before making off</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the sphere ship. As the sphere bodies were mineral</seg><seg type="columnLine">in nature, they used no organic food and very little</seg><seg type="columnLine">water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite Jameson's protestations, Bellant was placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a room by himself and left unpunished for his gross</seg><seg type="columnLine">misdeeds. The Erbian did not understand physical pun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishment and so did not feel that a good whipping might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be efficacious. After making all arrangements for a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn of the sphere ship to Erb, the entire party returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the earth ship via the fourth dimension and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to return to Erb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The return was uneventful and although Harry's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers itched to get at Bellant, Elam saw to it that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men stayed apart. At a trial later, Bellant was</seg><seg type="columnLine">convicted of gross misconduct and was sentenced to ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">years' study of social behavior under a guard. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">later decided to return Bellant to earth when the party</seg><seg type="columnLine">set out on the return voyage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fact that no more trouble was encountered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bellant proved that the fellow was pretty well subdued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT last, able to devote his entire energy to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">object of the voyage to Polaris, Jameson plunged</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•	into the conclave and the meeting of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">various delegates from all over the Universe. Literally</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of individuals were brought together there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each a little different from every other one and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">vastly different from the earth men. Among the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual types of life were beings whose bodies were so</seg><seg type="columnLine">far advanced in evolution as to be nothing but a brain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried about by mechanical servants. These peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows came from the very depths of the Milky Way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had been making a tour of the Universe when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped to visit the Polaris planets. They represented</seg><seg type="columnLine">as high an intelligence as could be found, the earth men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were told. Strange as it seemed, they were the ones with</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom it was easiest for the men of earth to communi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">COSMIC STEEPLE-CHASE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">65</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Month after month passed and ever new and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous things were revealed to the earth men. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">store of knowledge was rapidly becoming too great to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">useful--literally thousands of the marvels of chemistry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">biology, and physics would be hundreds of years ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the people to whom the delegates of earth would re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn. Much of the knowledge would remain only as</seg><seg type="columnLine">records until the intelligence level of the average man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth rose to a point where such information would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">of value. Much of the more intricate reasoning and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation passed about at the conclave simply passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the heads of Jameson and his men--they did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the experience to enable them to grasp what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on. Many of the more miraculous feats of intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligence displayed at general meetings simply didn't reg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ister with the earth men. The operations of mind on</seg><seg type="columnLine">these higher levels meant nothing at all any more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a complicated calculation of marvelous radio apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">would mean anything to an African bushman. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly Jameson learned that to understand a thing, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of it must fall within his previous experience so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it could be recognized at least in part.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The months rolled on, each one adding to the store</seg><seg type="columnLine">of knowledge and the volumes of notes which were all to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be taken back to earth. The delegates to this conclave</seg><seg type="columnLine">had agreed upon a meeting once every period of Erbian</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, which amounted to about a century of earth time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No one on the visit this time from Earth would ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet at the conclave again, but with the secrets of pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longing life, the Jameson party hoped to impart to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new generations of earth many times the usual three</seg><seg type="columnLine">score ten years allowed man for his span of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Important points of universal law were decided upon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and visits between planetary systems were arranged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The earth men were scheduled for a visit to Alpha Cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tauri ten earth years hence--and in the meantime a</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of Erbians was to visit the Solar system to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what could be done for the general betterment of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabitants of the planets there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All war between systems was banned as a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, and a court of judgment was set up for settling</seg><seg type="columnLine">disputes arising between parties in the same system. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">a special recognition of the efforts of earth men, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were the intellectual babies in the conclave, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Solar system was chosen for the next conclave a century</seg><seg type="columnLine">hence. Many a conjecture was made as to just what</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress mankind could make in the century before him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he became host to the Universe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a year and a half of Erbian time the conclave</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper broke up, and a large majority of the visiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">delegates boarded their ships, sealed their doors, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailed away into the sea of space toward their respective</seg><seg type="columnLine">homes. The delegation from Earth was to remain, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, and after all but a few of the visiting parties had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, plans were laid and put into use to educate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty members of the party from Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Day by day the earth men learned what the marvels</seg><seg type="columnLine">of raw energy w'ere and how to obtain the energy di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly from the molecular forces holding matter together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In this Bellant went farther than any of the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party, since it was his field. Strangely he and Jameson</seg><seg type="columnLine">became more intimate in their relations than ever before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but through it that feeling that the other was an enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran, and each was constantly on his guard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day came when the earth party was to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Solar system through the marvelous electronic telescope</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Erbians. They were all to be well versed in cosmic</seg><seg type="columnLine">geography before the lesson was finished. Since Jameson</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the leader of the party, he it was who first glimpsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiny ball of fire and the nine planets and hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of asteroids faintly visible about the central sun. Fortu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nately for the observers, the plane of the ecliptic of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Solar system is nearly at right angles to the polar axis</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the universe as indicated by men of earth. This made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the observer on Polaris look down on the Solar system</seg><seg type="columnLine">from above the plane of the ecliptic, and observe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet bodies circling in their orbits about the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There, before the party, the scene was gradually de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped after Jameson's initial observation, and shortly</seg><seg type="columnLine">there appeared on the big screen a shadowy picture of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small ball of fire and spaced about it were wee points</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly luminous, each representing a planet. The asteroid</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt appeared to be a faint circle of light, placed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifth position of Bode's numbers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jameson's mention of this caused the Erbians to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quire what this Bode's numbers might be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It has been observed that the planets and asteroids</seg><seg type="columnLine">are distant from the sun at intervals which seem rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular and correspond roughly to 4-7-10-16-28-52-100-</seg><seg type="columnLine">196-388," explained Harry in best astronomical style,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but we are about convinced that this relation is entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">accidental and has no real "law" as Bode would have it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The distances and numbers get entirely out of gear as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">go from the inner planets (the first four about the sun)</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the outer or major planets."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Much investigation followed and the men of earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned a great deal about the Solar system that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never even been suspected by earth men before. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Erbians believed that all planets of Sol, with the possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">exception of Mercury, were inhabited by living beings--</seg><seg type="columnLine">not all like men but some sort of life. They pointed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the types of life exhibited during the conclave,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and showed where the mineral beings could easily live</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Jupiter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the major planets are all excessively cold," Alice</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupted. "They all range around 170 degrees below</seg><seg type="columnLine">zero Fahrenheit. All water would be ice. Even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds we see about these planets are probably clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of condensed carbon dioxide."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The discussion waxed warm, and to the Erbian's de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, men of earth actually argued some of the Erbians</seg><seg type="columnLine">off their feet. This pleased the Polar men and with re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">newed vigor the education process was attacked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At every turn Harry and Alice were together, learning</seg><seg type="columnLine">side by side. Always in their shadow Bellant followed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He made no effort to interfere, did not annoy the girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor did he bother Jameson. Notwithstanding, Jameson</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept very close watch and for over a year the guard he</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept over Alice was vigorous and attentive. Since all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bellant's equipment and apparatus had been taken from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, the girl no longer feared the invisibility cover with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Bellant had formerly captured her; she actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoyed an occasional tiff with Bellant in their intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lectual clashes during study hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three years had passed and still the party from earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied. The whole of the Erbian race was immensely</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud of what they had contributed to the education of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these thirty inferior beings from the far away Solar Sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem. Not alone in the scientific fields had the party</seg><seg type="columnLine">been thoroughly trained and advanced, but in sociology,</seg><seg type="columnLine">religious life, the ways of living, and general government.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By this time each and every member of the earth party</seg><seg type="columnLine">66</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was as an intellectual giant compared to other earth be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings. Especially had Bellant progressed in physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">studies. His knowledge of electricity and raw energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">was astounding even to the Erbians. It was whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that perhaps he knew too much! What use would he</seg><seg type="columnLine">make of his knowledge? He had proved a rascal twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">before--why not again?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How much truth this whispered fear had in it they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to find out all too soon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the fourth and last year of their visit drew to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">close, the men of earth began to turn their thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward home--yes, even that germ-infested, dirty, striv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing old world, Earth, looked very good to these chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren of Sol for after all, a few years cannot basically</seg><seg type="columnLine">change human nature. The women in the party, for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marvelous things they found to do on Erb where</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone was a part of society and no sex distinctions</seg><seg type="columnLine">were made, were frankly homesick. The Erbians could</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely comprehend this, but after thinking upon a sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject, rightly concluded that even with all that man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned on his visit with them, he was in principle</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a high grade animal with a rising but not "risen"</seg><seg type="columnLine">intellect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From this time on the party became more restive and</seg><seg type="columnLine">after many attempts to get full attention to further</seg><seg type="columnLine">studies, the Erbians wisely concluded that earth man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cup was full, and that more intelligence poured therein</seg><seg type="columnLine">would simply run over the sides to waste. With regret,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for every teacher likes to impart his knowledge to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fullest extent, the great leader, Alkad of the Erbians,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a lengthy speech of appreciation for the attentive</seg><seg type="columnLine">and willing attitude of the earth men while visiting Erb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and informed them that the Erbians wished them God-</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed on their return voyage which would require an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other three-year period of cosmic travel, back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Solar system.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This polite but welcome dismissal of the earth men</seg><seg type="columnLine">was met with open welcome by the entire party. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">conference, Jameson delivered a return address express-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the lifelong thanks and appreciation of the men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth for all the wonderful knowledge given them by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their beloved brothers and benefactors, the Erbians.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thanks were given for the original invitation to come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polaris and for the books of knowledge accompanying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the invitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Full energies were now turned toward the recondition-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the space ship and all kinds of supplies were laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">in for the return voyage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A trailer ship was designed and attached for carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimens, special machinery, volumes of notes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest of all, a few individuals from various systems</seg><seg type="columnLine">who agreed to go back to Earth. The sphere-bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ninth planet of Sol were to return to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">home and the Erbians urged that the two ships join</seg><seg type="columnLine">company, allow themselves to be fastened together, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to the Solar systems as brothers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With great misgiving Jameson and his leaders agreed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bellant was especially agreeable to this plan. Later, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned that the idea was suggested by Bellant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a crowning glory, Elam, the guide of the eartli</seg><seg type="columnLine">party, while in the Polaris system, asked to be allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go back to Earth with the party. Naturally, the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">party was overjoyed, for they not only admired Elam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but loved him as a brother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Preparations were finally completed, the earth ship and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass-like spherical ship of the sphere-bodies were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly fastened together with a communicating door be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween, and the loaded trailer ship was attached to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base of the earth flyer. With final farewells, many heart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aches, and promises of an early visit from the Erbians</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Earth, the three-ship unit rose slowly from the sphere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Erb, sailed up vertically to the plane of the ecliptic of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polaris planets, and with an ever increasing rush,</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaked out into space with twenty-nine hearts bent on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quick return to Earth. Only Bellant was not quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to land on the earth--not until he had complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">control of plans he was even then laying for his great</seg><seg type="columnLine">"coup." Could Jameson have looked into Bellant's heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this time, he would have severed the ships instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thrown Bellant into irons for the rest of the voyage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHORTLY after the homeward start, Elam called</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a general meeting. Here he brought forth a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan for making the voyage back to Earth seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">much shorter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Standing on the table amid the group, he demonstrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">a synthetic drug much used on Erb for producing tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porary slowing down of all bodily functions. With it he</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed a drug for relieying this condition. Upon cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culation it was found that one injection of the drug</seg><seg type="columnLine">would hold a man in a sort of suspended animation for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a full year. At that time it was deemed advisable to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vive the individual and recondition him physically. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">body very slowly wasted away during this period as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was used for food--only a minute amount of energy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">required to keep the body alive in this condition. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject retained a hazy consciousness during the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">time with periods of.natural sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was agreed that most of the party should be placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the influence of the drug. Jameson was to remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">on guard, keeping things in order. The rest of the party</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be brought out of their sleep-like condition every</seg><seg type="columnLine">year for a month.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The injection was continued until all but Jameson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alice, and Bellant were placed in their beds. Elam's</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach to Bellant was met with a stone-wall resistance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The physicist not only desired to remain awake, but in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted that he be let alone--he had much to do on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes, he said, and there were many experiments he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to conduct. Although a bit worried by this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jameson agreed, with the warning that on no account</seg><seg type="columnLine">would he tolerate any treachery. Bellant's only response</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a rather faint smile and an all-enveloping look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alice. Elam noted this and, remembering the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">history, determined to keep close watch on Bellant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With Alice placed under the drug influence, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained only Jameson, Elam, and Bellant about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. These three had their meals together and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained on watch while the others slept. The time</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged. While each had ftiuch to keep him busy, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">all longed for the time when the rest of the party</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be revived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bellant worked in his shop incessantly, behind closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors. He even refused to admit Elam, while he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">working, insolently telling Elam that he wouldn't under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand anyway. This was the first insult that Elam had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever had, and he went to Jameson to get its full mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. When Jameson translated the statement, the Erbian</seg><seg type="columnLine">boiled with a rage he had not known in his whole life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was absorbing a few of the traits of earthmcn in</seg><seg type="columnLine">COSMIC STEEPLE-CHASE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of himself. It was only by very sharp disciplining</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Jameson prevented Elam from going right back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack Bellant. How very primitive, for an Erbian,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jameson pointed out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without further word Elam went to work in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory aboard, and remained very secluded for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance of the first year. It was only when the year</seg><seg type="columnLine">was up that the two earth men saw what he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">working on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Coming from the laboratory with Elam, one bearing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flask of the drug which relieved the state of coma of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping passengers, and the other holding an injection</seg><seg type="columnLine">needle, were two very strange looking organisms. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood about four feet tall, had an eye, a nose, an ear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a sort of long snout, all arranged on the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body proper. There were four arms with four very</seg><seg type="columnLine">supple tentacles for fingers, and for means of locomo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion each had a wheel on which he rolled along. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel was part of the body and had a sort of "tire" of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cartilage about it and was centered on a ball and socket</seg><seg type="columnLine">joint of bone! They were flesh colored and hairless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each seemed to balance perfectly on its "wheel-foot" as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bellant called it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Meet my new servants, gentlemen," commented Elam</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he came forward. "The one with the flask is called</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tick, the other Tock. I name them so because they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">designed to respond to those names only. I have heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of your party refer to a certain Tick Tock who is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I presume, some one of importance on your planet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two earth men roared with laughter and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jameson explained who Tick Tock was, Elam joined in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But where did you get them? I am sure you didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring them with you," said Bellant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, replied Elam, "I grew these right here on board</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the past four months. You will remember that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought a great number of containers of organisms with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me when we left Erb. I have put these together and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlled them as to grow these servants. They have</seg><seg type="columnLine">brains, too--but not too powerful ones. As you know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are two parts of all animals which control kinds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and extents of growth in them. The chromosomes with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their genes and the glands of the body, mainly the so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called 'ductless glands/ To make a complicated matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple, I simply alter the genes in the chromosomes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the different traits I want brought out, and control</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glands chemically to promote or retard growth in dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent parts of the body. It's a matter of control in</seg><seg type="columnLine">both kind and extent of animal growth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us bring the party out of its sleep and feed them</seg><seg type="columnLine">--they will be rather thin by now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After much work, the entire party was revived, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">each declared he had been but dozing a few minutes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, a glance at the constellations proved to each</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had indeed been dozing a long time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a month the party ate and slept normally, en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joying life immensely. Then the entire bunch was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the state of coma, and this time Jameson went</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the drug too. His assistant, White, took over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">duties of the ship and with him Alice stayed awake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She knew a great deal about Jameson's plans and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to help White enormously. Again Bellant refused</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drug, and again Elam tried to find out what great</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem was occupying Bellant so continuously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bellant had become so busy, that he asked to have his</seg><seg type="columnLine">meals sent to his workroom. Alice was indignant at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">first, but on the advice of Elam she simply awaited de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velopments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elam was elated. This was just the chance he wanted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When asked, Bellant readily agreed to have one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elam's peculiar animal servants bring in his meals. Lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle did he realize what that piece of flesh could be trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Day after day Elam spent with his servant, altering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the internal structure and training it, hour upon hour.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a month the servant became more alert, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">several times Bellant noted the animal looking carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. For some reason Bellant did not suspect that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal could have intelligence. Perhaps it was the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance of the thing--just a hairless bunch of flesh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far from the dumb' animal it appeared to be, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the servant was observing, and each day, when it re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned from Bellant's laboratory, it recorded what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen. Every day it drew plans, duplicates of what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen in Bellant's rooms. Soon Bellant became too</seg><seg type="columnLine">engrossed to note much of what the servant did. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal took to making Bellant's bed and straightening</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his drawing desk. It cleaned the floors--did every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing a good servant and valet could do. Bellant came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to depend on it greatly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this while Elam was assembling copies of the notes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plans that Bellant believed to be his alone. Soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the servant began to draw diagrains of complicated elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tric machinery Bellant was actually building, and Elam</seg><seg type="columnLine">built them too, studying carefully each part for its pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose. Gradually a glimmering of the truth came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. How he wished it possible to take by force the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts from Bellant's mind, but long ago the Erbian</seg><seg type="columnLine">had found it impossible to read the thoughts of an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividual unless the subject willed it so. So much of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess work he was speculating on could Elam certify,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if only he were able to delve into Bellant's mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Month after month passed, and finally Bellant became</seg><seg type="columnLine">less seclusive. He took his meals with the others again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was more jovial. At Elam's suggestion, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">servant was still detailed to clean up and tidy Bellant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Soon Bellant began to spend a great deal of time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the base of the ship where the great driving mech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anism was. Several times Elam surprised the physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cist as he was meddling with the wiring of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue globe and the green disc. Each time Bellant ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained that he was trying to get in mind exactly how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship was propelled, and Elam believed it--for that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly what Bellant was doing--learning how the mech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anism worked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elam's suspicions now became practical certainties and</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more he became a recluse in his laboratory. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">few days he would l-eturn to the company of the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the people, each time spending every minute he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at Alice. This annoyed Bellant considerably as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt that here was a new contender for the beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's favor. He questioned Elam closely about what</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied him so much in his lab, and each time Elam</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied that he was growing a new type of servant. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was really the truth, although the servant was not quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he led Bellant to believe it was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second year came to an end, and once more the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole party was awakened and fed well for a month,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again placed under the drug influence. This time</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alice went too, and Jameson remained conscious to com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete the journey now well on towards the end. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">68</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had made better time on the return, and the trip would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be shortened by about three months. That meant that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only eight months were left. Jameson was jubilant--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he intended to make short work of disposing of Bellant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">once on earth, and then he and Alice could have that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">home they both wanted. Had he known the short but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">terrific struggle they would go through by that time, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would have forced Bellant into using the coma-producing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drug and cut loose from the sphere ship attached to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">earth flyer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A month later Elam's servant began to report clandes-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tine visits of Bellant to the sphere ship. It had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">agreed to remain separate parties throughout the voyage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">This was a breach of faith, both on Bellant's part and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that of the sphere-bodies. Again Elam's fears were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">being confirmed, and he redoubled his labor in his work</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shop. One day he was finished, and confided to Jameson</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that he had a masterpiece finished, but that 110 one was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to see it for some time; he would, however, show it to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jameson first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Following this, Elam suddenly decided that the three</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">men--Bellant, Jameson, and himself--should make a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tour of the rooms to observe the sleeping passengers. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was so arranged, and the three made the tour, giving</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">each party a thorough inspection as to general health</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and room conditions. All three being interested in Alice,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it was not surprising that they lingered rather long in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her room. Elam pointed out how healthy the girl looked,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and how curly her hair was--a rather odd thing for him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to do thought Jameson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The next watch, when Elam alone stayed on guard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">while Bellant and Jameson were supposed to be asleep,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a shadowy figure stole down the corridor to Alice Bald-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">win's door and slipped inside the room. A moment later</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the shadow reappeared, one arm full of some soft cloth-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like things--possibly clothing. Stealing back the cor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ridor, the shadow slipped out of sight for about five min-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">utes and then reappeared, bearing in its arms something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">very large and bulky. It staggered a little as it fled down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the corridor a second time, stopped at Alice's door,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">looked hastily about, and melted from sight into the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shadow of the open door. Two minutes elapsed and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">again the shadow slipped out into the darkened hallway,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">apparently bearing the same large bulky bundle in its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">arms. Again it hurried up the corridor, and silently</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turned down a side hall. A footfall sounded from be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">low, and the shadow made a dash for its room, popping</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inside and clicking the latch just as Bellant came into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The physicist had heard the swish and the click of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the latch, and stopped dead still a moment. Using his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flashlight, he picked out Jameson's door, and without a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knock of warning, flung open the door and stepped with-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in, throwing his spotlight on the sleeping form of Jame-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">son. Without a doubt the sleeper had not moved for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some time and was genuinely startled when Bellant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aroused him. Satisfied that it had not been Jameson</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whom he had heard, he mentioned the incident and to-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gether they went in search of Elam, whom they found</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the observation room making some calculations as to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">•	their speed, position in space, and so on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Have you been here long?" inquired Bellant sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Ever since I left you at your room," replied Elam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why do you ask?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Could you prove you have been here all the time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jameson queried. "Some one was just through our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor, and it was neither of us. Sure you weren't?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must be dreaming. I'm sure I've been here for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long time. I think you're working too hard, Jameson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am sure you don't get enough sleep, Bellant," com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented Elam. The last statement carried double mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, but it went over Bellant's head entirely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, it's mighty funny. I swear I heard a rustle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then the click of a latch. You are sure you weren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">back then for anything, Elam?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bellant, he has already told you he has been here</seg><seg type="columnLine">since he left us," Jameson said with some heat. For all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his admiration of the physicist's knowledge, in Jameson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart smouldered a mild hate for this fellow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The incident passed and no more was thought of it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least not for a few months.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once again the three men made a tour of the sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers, and each was found to be exactly as before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This time it was Bellant who commented on Alice's</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty. He and Jameson agreed that, if possible, Alice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more beautiful than before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She seems to have more color today, and her hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems more flaxen than it was," Jameson noted and Bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lant agreed. Elam looked on, and said little. For some</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason Elam had this time advised against a close ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amination of the passengers and so the tour was soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BY now the Solar system was quite visible and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of high power, the telescope revealed tjie</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire system with its nine planets, the asteroids,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the central sun. It was when the ship was within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a week of the Solar system that the blow fell. Jameson</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on guard, and Elam and Bellant had been at rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without warning, while Jameson was making some</seg><seg type="columnLine">pencil sketches of the Solar system through the telescope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planets and sun slid off to the left, leaving the field</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the instrument. Jameson was nonplused for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and then grasped a small hand instrument, caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the star, Sol, in the field, and was amazed to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole system apparently swinging away to the left. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a full minute he was speechless; suddenly the truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawned--the Solar system was not veering to the left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavorting off through space--the earth ship was off its</seg><seg type="columnLine">path! Frantically Harry worked with the controls, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">to no avail. The ship simply would not respond, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">every minute the course away from Earth was widening</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swinging away into space!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down to Elam's room Jameson raced and burst in 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sleeping man. Quickly he related what had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened, and Elam came rushing up to see for himself. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">now they were headed way out into space, the Solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">system behind to the left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now do as I say. Find out if the sphere ship is still</seg><seg type="columnLine">attached to us, apd report to me immediately," Elam</seg><seg type="columnLine">commanded, and as Harry hurried away, the Erbian</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted to the workroom of Bellant. The physicist was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, and so were all of his effects. Even the machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been building lay wrecked and shattered. Elam</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped quickly into his own laboratory, closed the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made several rapid adjustments of dials and</seg><seg type="columnLine">switches. Rapidly he made the changes, hesitated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that they were correct, and hastened back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">observatory just in time to meet Jameson as he came in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">COSMIC STEEPLE-CHASE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's gone!

They find a strange city, named Troyana, which has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been lost to the world for ages. It is peopled by a race of</seg><seg type="columnLine">profound scientists, descendants of the ancient Trojans, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold as slaves the descendants of the inhabitants of the lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantis. They are hospitably received by Nahum, an official</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the city. Nankivell falls in love with Estha, his host's</seg><seg type="columnLine">granddaughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Troyana is a benevolent autocracy ruled by the nobles under</seg><seg type="columnLine">their Master. There are four classes of nobles, wearing purple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimson, blue, and yellow robes respectively. Below these are</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black-clad Burden Bearers, or Atlantean slaves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During an annual religious ceremony, the Adoration of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Golden Calf, a revolution breaks out headed by Amos, a crimson-</seg><seg type="columnLine">robed traitor. The slaves capture the lower city, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobles hold the sanctuary in the upper city. The fight develops</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a stalemate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nahum learns of the attachment between Estha and Nankivell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and advises the strangers to leave Troyana. They do so, carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Estha with them. The next afternoon she is recaptured</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the rest sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night Nankivell sees her in a vision as a captive of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amos. Without waking his companions, he steals all of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ammunition and returns to her rescue, despite the sentence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death passed on him if he returns. The others return to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">homes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nankivell gets to the lower city. Pressed by Burden Bearers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he descends into a labyrinth below the city, where he is menaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">by giant toads and finds a race of richly clad people sleeping in</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge crystal cylinders. He cannot open the cylinders and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deavors to return to the sanctuary. He emerges from the laby-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rinth to find himself in the jungle, where Gedaliah, the Warder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Outer Ways of Troyana, is about to attack with his Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards, hoping to rescue the nobles. Nankivell attacks with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They win through to the city, but art: captured by Amos. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">offers them safety and rich rewards if they will join him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they refuse. By a ruse, which Estha is able to effect by virtue</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her having been High Priestess of the Golden Calf at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">annual religious ceremonies, she hypnotizes the slaves who</seg><seg type="columnLine">are now on the side of the traitor Amos long enough to allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell and herself to escape to the sanctuary. Nankivell's</seg><seg type="columnLine">return is condoned, but the Master refuses to permit his mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riage to Estha until the rebellion is crushed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The energy and weapons of'Troyana are almost exhausted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell sends a radio message to Mariston and Willis asking</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to return to the city, bringing cobalt, the substance from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the nobles of Troyana generate their energy by atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">disintegration.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the sleepers and awaken them. The Atlantean king agrees</seg><seg type="columnLine">to aid them and send his subjects for cobalt. Instead of bring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it, they treacherously attack the nobles of Troyana with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralyzing violet ray.

The two left</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing beat a hasty retreat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE way was long and weary, but the cavern en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance yawned before them at last. As they plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">into its depths, Nankivell stopped for a last look down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long cavern. Across the upper end he could see a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen figures racing toward the upper entrance. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the men who had been restored to life while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first six were out getting ready their terrible weapons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Among them Nankivell could pick out the figure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">king. He dropped prone and covered the flying figure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he said regretfully as he rose. "I've only got</seg><seg type="columnLine">four cartridges left and I don't dare waste them. I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably miss a running man at that distance and I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">care to let them know that a rifle isn't infallible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned to Nahum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You had better form our men in column again," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Leave most of the charged tubes in the rear. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">command the rear guard and hold the Atlanteans back</seg><seg type="columnLine">on every curve until the main body rounds the next one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then we'll retreat after you. I've got ten shells for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol and four for my rifle, so I can delay them a while.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Look out for the Divellcrs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nahum formed his men in the formation suggested by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell. With a dozen men the American held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear while the balance made their way forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't think we'll have them after us for a while,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Nankivell to Mordecai, the leader of the detachment</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him. "They'll stop to rouse a number of their com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rades before they start in pursuit. Our biggest danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be from the Dwellers"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nankivell's prediction was borne out by subsequent</seg><seg type="columnLine">events. No attack came from the rear. The column</seg><seg type="columnLine">made its way forward at a good speed. Gradually the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light faded out and all along the line, hand lights began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to glow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look out for trouble!" he suddenly exclaimed. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose had caught a whiff of the reptilian odor which</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked the presence of the huge toads who had taken so</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy a toll of the column on its way out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardly had the words left his mouth than there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crash of a flashtube from the main body ahead. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">musky odor became nauseating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look sharp with the lights!" he cautioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little group of men under his command turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lights nervously, first one way and then the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently a vague form could be made out in the gloom</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Charge him!" cried Nankivell, setting the example bv</seg><seg type="columnLine">running forward with a shout. The huge bulk retreated</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him with a slight scuffling sound. The stench</seg><seg type="columnLine">became almost intolerable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he passed a cross corridor, a huge bulk lunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him, but Nankivell was not napping. His flash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube roared and the Dweller was cast aside in a crumpled</seg><seg type="columnLine">heap. From ahead of him could be heard the occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of a tube, telling that the main body was not im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mune from attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bulk he was pursuing turned upNa cross passage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell approached cautiously, his tube held ready. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">TROYANA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shot his light down the route which the Dweller had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken but saw nothing. A slight scuffling sound behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him made his hair stand on end and chills run up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spine. He whirled about but before he could complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">the movement a flashtube roared behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The way is clear, Brother Nankivell," came Mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">decai's calm voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks," said Nankivell. "We had better catch up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the main body. I think the Dwellers are enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">protection for our rear just now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abandoning all efforts to guard the way behind them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rearguard raced forward, ever on the alert for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach of the huge toads. Presently a flash and a roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred yards ahead told them that they had almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the gap which separated them from the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nankivell looked back along the way they had come.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the darkened passage, a slender pencil ray of</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet light made itself dimly visible in the gloom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here they come," he cried. "Mordecai and one other</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay with me. The rest join Nahum. I'll try to stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pie dropped prone, his rifle stock cuddled against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheek. The source of the violet light came nearer. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was only a hundred yards away. Beside him, prone</seg><seg type="columnLine">011 the floor, their lights extinguished, lay his two com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions. Nankivell could not see the source of the violet</seg><seg type="columnLine">light but he knew pretty well where it must be. He lined</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rifle as carefully as he could in the darkness and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a prayer, squeezed his trigger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a flash of orange light and an ear-splitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack. From up the tunnel came a cry of pain and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet light veered wildly. Again Nankivell fired. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">light dropped to the floor and he could hear the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of running feet. He rose to go forward but there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fateful hissing sound he had heard in the vast cavern,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only now a hundred times intensified. Through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark a tiny spark wended its way toward him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sprang to the side of the cavern, realizing the use-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessness of the move. When that spark burst, everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a radius of a hundred yards would be struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the tiny whirling sparks whose touch meant agony</seg><seg type="columnLine">unspeakable. Suddenly the spark died away. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hiss and an overwhelming reek of fetor. Nankivell</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned on his light. One of the huge Dwellers had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">creeping up in the darkness and the strange missile had</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck it fairly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never thought I'd learn to love one of those things,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said whimsically, "but if I had time, I'd go back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop a tear on his ugly carcass. Come on, men, the war</seg><seg type="columnLine">is over for a minute. Let's retreat to the next turn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make another stand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With Mordecai and his companion ahead of him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell sprinted up the tunnel. He dared not turn on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his light and prayed fervently as he ran that none of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dwellers would choose that moment for an attack. Luck</seg><seg type="columnLine">was with him and he rounded the next curve and saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights of the main column a hundred yards ahead of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Speed up your retreat, Nahum!" he cried. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlanteans are after us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are almost beyond the region of the Under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground Dwellers," was the- welcome answer. "If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can hold them back for another half mile, we will be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the safe region."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll hold them as long as the ammunition holds out,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied Nankivell. "The next time I'll let them come</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to close quarters and use my pistol more effectively."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The column went on leaving the three men alone in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dark. Around the corner a dim glow of violet light</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could be seen. He drew his pistol and slipped off the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">safety. There was a dull thud in the darkness and then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">silence. Suddenly his nose caught a whiff of a strange</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sweet odor. He sniffed again and his head swam and his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">senses reeled. With a sudden suspicion he turned on his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">light. Twenty yards ahead of him on the floor lay a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">small globe from which pale green gas was slowly ooz-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Run!" he gasped, staggering to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mordecai rose feebly but the other man did not stir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell stooped and grasped him by the collar. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man was slight and with an effort of which he had not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">known himself capable, Nankivell threw the man over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder and staggered at a feeble trot up the corri-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dor toward Troyana.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He had gone less than a hundred yards when a beam</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of pale violet light pierced the darkness over his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He dumped his burden on the ground and whirled about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The source of the light had rounded the curve. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">raised his pistol and fired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Again there came a sound of retreating feet and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">light winked out. Nankivell shouldered the unconscious</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">form of his follower and staggered on. He made his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">way for four hundred yards before he came to another</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bend in the tunnel. He dropped his burden and bent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over it, his ear at the man's chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Farewell, Brother," he said sadly as he raised his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">head. "May the Great Architect bless and receive you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and may your years in the place where you have gone be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">happy ones."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With a sudden thought he raised the body of the dead</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man and held it before him like a shield.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Run, Mordecai!" he exclaimed. "Join Nahum and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell him that I will hold the rear alone. Bid him haste</seg><seg type="columnLine">all he can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Planner demurred, but Nankivell spoke per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">emptorily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Obey my orders!" he said. "Alone I may be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold them. With the added care of you, I could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. Go!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mordecai turned and fled up the tunnel. Nankivell</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lifted the body of the dead man and moved forward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">around the curve. In the distance he could see the flicker</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the deadly violet beam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Nearer it came until it was only thirty yards from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him. The wandering beam picked him out and played</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over the dead body. Nankivell crouched behind it pray-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing that it would not penetrate the flesh. He felt a sud-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">-den numbness in his side as the beam found an unpro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tected spot. The beam raised and played over the rest of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel. Presently it winked out. Footsteps ap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">proached slowly. He gripped his pistol and waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THE oncoming Atlantean was less than ten feet from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him when Nankivell fired. There was a crash as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the man fell. Without a pause Nankivell fired twice</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more down the cavern. Screams of pain rewarded him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Again came a sharp hiss, but Nankivell was on his feet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and running for dear life. He rounded the curve before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the spark burst, sending its thousands of sparks of de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">struction in all directions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I think that'll hold them for a while," he muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It's lucky those big toads haven't complicated matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">74</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more. Now if I can catch up with Nahum before he is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">too far away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ran at his best speed up the tunnel. It began t)</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope upward and his breath came hard. He rounded a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve and found himself in a tunnel barely ten feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">across. A hundred and fifty yards ahead of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">marched the main body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think I've stopped them for the present," he said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nahum as he panted up, "but they'll come on again. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can reach the sanctuary and close the door on them</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll get a breathing space at least. How many men</seg><seg type="columnLine">did you lose on the passage?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eight," said Nahum sadly. "Seven taken by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dwellers and one smitten by a poorly aimed flashtube.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The stairs are but a few hundred yards ahead. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">while we climb them that the Atlantean will have their</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to make an end of us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not necessarily," said Nankivell cheerfully. "I still</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a few shots left and I think I have them pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">well buffaloed. I'll go last and take an occasional pot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot at them if they get too frisky. Climbing the stairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">is going to be the hard task. I doubt whether all of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">can make it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those to whom the Great Architect gives strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">will win through to safety," replied Nahum. "We are</seg><seg type="columnLine">all in His hands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before them loomed the flights of steps. Nankivell</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuddered as he thought of the thirty-five hundred steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">before them. He looked back along the route they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come. In the distance flickered the deadly violet light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Forward!" he cried. "There is no time for loiter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing."	5 \</seg><seg type="columnLine">The column started up the long ascent. Nankivell</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed slowly in order to keep his hand steady. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted two hundred steps before the violet light</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the bottom of the flight. Now it started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mount but it was no longer playing about as it had been.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It held a straight course and one which it was easy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid. Crouched on one side of the steps, Nankivell</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he judged that the light was within sixty steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him, he raised his rifle to his shoulder. Steadily he</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeezed his trigger. From the source of the light came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brilliant purple flash and then darkness. A sound as</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men in agony reached him. A lucky shot had wrecked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the device which had been brought after them. He raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rifle again and fired his last remaining shot into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huddle of dark forms he could dimly see below him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a sound of a body falling and he knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his last shot had been a good one. He raised his rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hurl it down toward them but a thought made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If they find the empty gun, they'll know I'm out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ammunition and they'll come right on," he reflected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's an awful weight to carry up these long stairs with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, but I don't dare discard it. Well, here goes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned and went rapidly up the three hundred re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maining steps of the flight. As he reached the top he</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused, almost exhausted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whew!" he cried. "I had no idea that climbing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">such hard work. If I hadn't been doped up by Jereboam</seg><seg type="columnLine">two years ago, I'd never be able to make it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused to recover his breath before he made his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way along the level space which separated the flights.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The main body was half way up the next set of steps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stopped and waited, pistol in hand, until the end of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the column had climbed to the top. Dim as the light was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lower stretches, his eyes, so long accustomed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness, could see plainly. When the main body had</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared on the level stretch, he started his climb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again he thought that his legs would fail him before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he surmounted the last of the five hundred steps, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim necessity drove him on. At the top he paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll make a stand here," he said. "They'll meet with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no opposition on the second flight and they'll come on</seg><seg type="columnLine">more carelessly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lay prone and watched down the steps. Presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forms of his pursuers came into view, climbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly as though they bore heavy weights. Wrhen they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were within thirty steps of the top they paused. Nanki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vell could see that the three men in the front rank bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long tubes from which had come the deadly sparks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a consultation, one of them raised a tube to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. Nankivell dared wait no longer. He leveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pistol and fired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HIS aim was good. With a choking cry, the gunner</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw up his arms and fell backwards, carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">another man with him in his fall. Nankivell fired again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one of the remaining gunners sank with a groan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The third raised his weapon and Nankivell spent another</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his few remaining rounds. The man dropped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube and grasped at his shoulder. Nankivell leaped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet and fled along the level toward the third flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His marksmanship had been good enough to stop the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuit for a time and he climbed two flights, well behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main body, before there was a sign of continuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time the Atlanteans changed their tactics. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of coming on in a compact group, they scattered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gunners in front. At each hundred steps they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause and fire upward a volley of their deadly sparks</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would burst into fragments, each of them loaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with suffering and death. Nankivell dared not wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they were close enough for accurate shooting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When they were, as nearly as he could judge, a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fifty steps below him, he fired one of his four re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maining loads. He aimed low and he could hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ricocheting bullet whine through the air. The Atlanteans</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped in their tracks like one man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again Nankivell fired and this time his shot took</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect. An Atlantean gave a cry of pain and leaped con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulsively upward. A volley of sparks flew upward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst below him. One spark fell on him and Nankivell</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit his lips to keep from screaming in agony as it touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The gunners were preparing to fire again. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped to his feet and fled as fast as his wearied limbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">would allow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the top of the fifth flight he turned and dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">prone, his heart pounding as though it would burst.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again the Atlanteans came resolutely ahead in a scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered formation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't stop them much longer," sobbed Nankivell</seg><seg type="columnLine">through set teeth. "I'll give them the two shots I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">left and hope it will hold them until we can win through</seg><seg type="columnLine">to safety."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rested his pistol ow the top step and took deliber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate aim. His pursuers were climbing slowly, stopping</seg><seg type="columnLine">every fifty steps to send a volley of deadly sparks ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. Again he let them come within a hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty steps before he fired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At his first shot one of the gunners dropped in a heap</seg><seg type="columnLine">TROYANA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and slipped slowly down the stairs. . Sparks flew up to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward him but fortunately they burst behind him and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not harmed. With a prayer on his lips, he fired his</seg><seg type="columnLine">last shot. A gunner rose to his feet with a shriek and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged down the long flight. Nankivell rose deliber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately and started down the stairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He had gone but ten steps when the Atlanteans rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">-with one accord and fled back down. Nankivell did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">press his advantage. As soon as the retreat was well</seg><seg type="columnLine">started, he retraced his steps and made his way slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with infinite difficulty up the sixth of the seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">flights leading to the sanctuary and, he hoped, to safety.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he surmounted the last of the steps he found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main body waiting for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I fear we can not climb the last flight unaided,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped Nahum as Nankivell joined them. "Can you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold them for ten minutes?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "My last shot has been fired," replied Nankivell. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">must press on, else death is our portion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A groan greeted his words. It was checked by an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamation from Jereboam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Succor!" he cried. "Look! One comes from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanctuary!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Down the flight of steps came a blue-clad Planner</seg><seg type="columnLine">at break-neck speed. Nahum rose and made his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly up the steps to meet him, the others trailing after</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, many of them on all fours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Planner raced down and came to a pause before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nahum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you brought aid and comfort, Junior</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warder?" he gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Alas, no, I bring only added peril," replied Nahum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Then is Troyana indeed doomed!" cried the mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">senger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What mean you?" demanded Nahum while a mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mur rose from the men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Our store of energy is completely gone," was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer. "Not one atom remains in the sanctuary. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cohorts of Amos have battered in the walls of the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">city and are now hammering at the door of the sanctuary</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XV</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rescue</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE was a moment of silence as the messenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried his words of doom. It was broken by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nahum's voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "To the sanctuary!" he cried hoarsely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Forgotten were fatigue and aching muscles. Forgot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten were the ruthless enemies behind them. In ihe mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of each noble of Troyana was but one thought, to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sanctuary and to interpose his body between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cohorts of Amos and the Holy of Holies in the assem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bly hall. As one man they raced up the long weary flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stairs, sobbing with weariness, yet held to their high</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose by the ingrained training of centuries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Foremost in the race were Nahum and Nankivell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The aged Junior Warder was driven by his loyalty to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Troyana and to the high order of which he was a mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber. Nankivell was impelled by a different motive. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore his mind's eye floated a sickening vision--Estha</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless in the hands of the degenerate Bearers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burdens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The ascent seemed endless. It required a separate</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort of his will for Nankivell to mount each one of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">steps. His heart pounded until it seemed that it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst through his ribs. His breath came in sobbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasps. Yet, strive as he would, Nahum kept three steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of him and was the first to mount the last step.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without a pause he raced along the level corridor which</seg><seg type="columnLine">led to the entrance to the beleaguered citadel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Nankivell's feet reached the level he stumbled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell for an instant on one knee. As he rose he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted again to throw away the useless rifle which</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore him down as though it weighed a hundred pounds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He paused for an instant before he threw it down. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an expression of grim determination he slung the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon back over his shoulder and ran as best he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the flying figure of the Junior Warder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the level, Nankivell's younger muscles stood him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in good stead. He was abreast of Nahum when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to the gap in the rock through which they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed to descend into the regions below the lower city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Side by side they dashed into the sanctuary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A cry of dismay broke from Nahum's lips and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reechoed by Nankivell. The situation was even worse</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the message of ill omen they had heard had led</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to believe. Through a gap which had been battered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the walls of the sanctuary itself poured a stream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">black-clad figures. Evidently Amos' supply of energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">was exhausted as well as that of his opponents for no</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash of flashtubes was heard. With sword, club, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">axe, the Burden Bearers attacked the thin line of bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liantly clad nobles who opposed them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crimson, blue and yellow were mingled indiscrimi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nately in the bitterly held battle line. The nobles were</seg><seg type="columnLine">outnumbered three to one and still through that gap</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wall, more black-clad figures poured. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry, Nahum drew his sword and dashed forward to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">his place in the line of battle. Nankivell glanced at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless weapons with a groan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, for just one bandolier of ammunition!" he cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, anyway, a Springfield makes a good club."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grasping his useless weapon by the muzzle he threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself into the fight. He found himself beside Zepha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">niah. The Master was endeavoring with a short sword,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the use of which he was none too expert, to defend</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself against the attack of two men armed with heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">axes. As Nankivell reached him, his guard was broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and a heavy axe swept down toward his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell thrust forward the stock of his rifle and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flected the blow. Stepping back a step he swung the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon. It crashed down on the head of his assailant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the same instant, Zephaniah's sword was driven home</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the body of the other attacker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You come in good time, Brother," gasped the Master.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Have you word of cheer?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None, Most Worshipful Sir. Other enemies are at</seg><seg type="columnLine">our heels with strange and terrible weapons."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then must we retreat while we may," replied Zepha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">niah.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had drawn back from the front of the battle line.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Master swept a keen eye up and down the line. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobles, reinforced by the men who had accompanied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nahum into the lower regions, were momentarily hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their own. Men in black robes with only a narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">band of color about their necks to mark their exalted</seg><seg type="columnLine">rank were still pouring through the doorway which led</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the chamber where the court of Atlantis slept. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now came a sudden diversion which gave his forces an</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">76</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Nahum's men joined the line, a flashtube crashed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A dozen men who were in front of the heavy charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">static electricity went down as though a thunderbolt had</seg><seg type="columnLine">smitten them. The first crash was followed by another</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet another until all along the line tubes flashed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared. The front rank of Amos' forces was swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">away and tossed into heaps, mere husks of quivering</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorched flesh. Above the din could be heard Nahum's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Forward!" he cried. "Sweep the scum back to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunts!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A cheer answered his words. More crashes of dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charging tubes filled the air with a roar of sound. Sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hand the nobles pressed forward. For a moment it</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked as though they would be victorious and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurl their attackers out of the sacred precincts they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dared to profane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a sudden cessation of the sound of dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charging tubes. The nobles still pressed forward, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Burden Bearers no longer retreated. Behind them</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood a figure, attired in the crimson robes of the cryp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic rite and with the golden jewel of a Master flashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Their tubes are exhausted!" he shouted. "Now they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are at your mercy! One more charge and we possess the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper city. Forward!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Amos!" cried Nankivell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He searched frantically in his pockets, hoping against</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope that he would find an overlooked cartridge, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope was vain. The black-clad line surged forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving back the defenders of the sanctuary by sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of numbers. An inspiration came to Nankivell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are the women?" he shouted to Zephaniah.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the assembly hall!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nankivell drew back from the battle line and raced at</seg><seg type="columnLine">top speed toward the inner hall where stood the Holy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Holies, the great altar of Troyana.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He burst through the half dozen men who guarded it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inside were a crowd of women and children, on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees praying silently for their men who battled to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">death outside. He looked around but could not find the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one he sought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"rfSTHA!" he shouted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A-j "Here, Frank," answered a clear voice as Estha</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose from her knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The other pistol, quick!" he panted. "If I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot Amos, we may turn the tide yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She handed the weapon to him. He paused for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant to snatch a hurried kiss before he dashed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the battle which waged in the courtyard. Amos</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still in plain sight, urging forward his minions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nankivell opened the pistol and gave an exclamation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of disappointment. He had thought that he had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">two cartridges in it, but there was only one. If he used</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to end Amos' evil career, there would be no sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">and merciful death for his beloved when the last barrier</seg><seg type="columnLine">was smashed and the hordes of Burden Bearers poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the assembly hall to work their will on the women</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their masters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Joo bad, but it can't be helped," he muttered. "Kill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him is our best chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved forward until he was in the thick of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight. Amos stood motionless, barely thirty yards from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He could get no closer safely. He raised the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol and carefully aligned the sights on the center of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the renegade's broad chest. He slowly tightened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp. There was a sharp crack as the weapon went</seg><seg type="columnLine">off. Nankivell hurled it to the ground with a cry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage. Just as he fired, one of the combatants lurched</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him. His lone bullet had gone wide of the mark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A blow fell on the back of his head and he lurched</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward. In an instant he was surrounded by black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad figures who thrust at him with swords and daggers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strove to reach him with their axes. Their very</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers hindered them so that for an instant he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unharmed. A sword hit home in his thigh and he dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">on one knee. His hand came in contact with an axe</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had fallen from the hand of a smitten man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he staggered to his feet, the weapon in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The close-packed ring about him gave back as a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantean rushed at him, a heavy axe lifted above his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. Nankivell dodged back and the axe swept harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less through the air. He leaped to one side as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his crippled leg would allow and smote in turn, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakened leg would not support him and he went down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a diabolical grin, the Atlantean raised his axe for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second stroke. Nankivell shut his eyes, but before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blow could fall, a sword flashed across him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried itself to the hilt in the black-clad body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nankivell staggered to his feet, axe in hand. Beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him stood Nahum, holding a bloody sword.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To my back!" the Junior Warder shouted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nankivell obeyed. Back to back the two men fought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nahum's sword a whirling circle of steel while Nanki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vell's rose and fell with deadly effect. Two men could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not long wage battle against such odds, but help was</seg><seg type="columnLine">close at hand. There was a sudden surge and a group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow-clad figures burst through the sombre ring. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled the two men and bore them back to the battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">line where the retreating nobles were doggedly con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">testing every step of the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The odds had grown until five Burden Bearers op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed every one of the higher degrees. By sheer weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of numbers they forced them back until the nobles were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered in a circle about the wide doors of the assembly</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shouting had long since died out. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath to waste in vain cries in that terrible struggle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only the ring of steel on steel and the dull thud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling axes could be heard with now and then an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voluntary cry of anguish from a wounded man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No quarter was asked or given. If a noble fell be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the feet of his former slaves, he knew his fate. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword or an axe ended his life if he were sorely wound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed. If not, he was dragged to the rear, doomed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered as a sacrifice to that grotesque travesty in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower city, before which the Burden Bearers celebrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">their depraved worship. The Atlanteans were waging</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grim war of extermination on those who had held</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in subjection and bred them like cattle for count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less generations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The circle of the altar's defenders grew steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller as man after man fell before the dogged attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Atlanteans. Still there was no thought of sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">render and each man fell on the ground where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood and another stepped forward to take his place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell drew back from the front line for an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked around. A cry of dismay and horror came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his parched lips. Through the gap in the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">which led to the lower regions emerged a line of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">attired in leather harness sparkling with brilliant gems</seg><seg type="columnLine">TROYANA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and with short cloaks of vivid colors hanging from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden collars. In the hands of the foremost were long</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin tubes somewhat resembling rifles. The long-sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing king of Atlantis had come to the aid of the descend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants of his abandoned subjects.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At Nankivell's cry there was a momentary pause in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fighting. Both sides looked at the newcomers anx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iously. The Burden Bearers feared that their former</seg><seg type="columnLine">masters had obtained assistance, while only those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fought underground with Nahum knew who the</seg><seg type="columnLine">newcomers were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A word of command barked sharply through the'</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence. The gunners raised their long tubes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fly!" cried Nankivell. "Into the assembly hall and</seg><seg type="columnLine">close the doors or all is lost."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last part of his speech was drowned in a sharp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-drawn-out hiss. From the threatening tubes came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a volley of bright sparks which sailed through the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the defenders of the altar. Just before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached their goal they burst and the air was filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of whirling motes of light. They settled on</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend and foe alike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the battlefield rang with screams of agony from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unfortunates who were struck by those whirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">motes. They rolled on the ground in almost unsupport-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able agony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above the screams sounded another hoarse word of</seg><seg type="columnLine">command. The gunners raised their tubes again. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">shudder ran through the ranks of the Troyana nobles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless against this horrible weapon. The seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be years in length. Nankivell felt that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could no longer stand the strain and that a scream</seg><seg type="columnLine">would burst from his lips despite himself unless his tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured mind gave way before the horror he knew was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming. The Atlantean king raised his hand. His lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened to give the word of command which would send</seg><seg type="columnLine">another volley of death-dealing missiles into the ranks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Troyana.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the silence came a sharp crack. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankiveil's astonished gaze the Atlantean king spun</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and fell headlong, the command ungiven. An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other vicious report split the air and one of the gunners</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw up his arms and fell backwards. As he did so there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a sharp hiss from his tube. A spark left it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled straight up. It burst and showered the whirl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing motes of light down on the adherents of the king</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Atlantis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With growing wonder Nankivell whirled about. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorway of the assembly hall, standing on the top-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the seven steps which separated the doorway</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the courtyard were two figures. In their hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rifles from which a steady stream of fire now</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured on the remnants of the court of Atlantis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bob Mariston!" he cried, unable to believe his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ray Willis!" he shouted as he recognized the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned and hobbled up the stairs, unslinging his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle from his back as he did so. /"*"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give me ammunition!" he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mariston ceased his fire long enough to unsling a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandolier, and toss it to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't waste a shot, youngster!" he cried as he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaded his rifle and fired again and again at the retreating</seg><seg type="columnLine">invaders from the lower levels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now there were three rifles pouring in a deadly hail</seg><seg type="columnLine">of missiles and the remnants of the Atlantean king's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">court were crowding one another to win through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow gap in the rock to comparative safety. In an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other moment they were gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three riflemen turned their weapons on the ranks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Burden Bearers. They fired rapidly but their</seg><seg type="columnLine">volume of fire was too small to have much effect on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of black-clad figures who had followed Amos</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the lower city. With the menace of the Atlantean</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobles removed, the attack was resumed. Desperately</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they fought, the nobles were still being driven back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite the withering fire of the rifles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two figures detached themselves from the battle line</seg><seg type="columnLine">and raced toward the assembly hall. They came to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">halt before the newcomers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Brought you energy, Worshipful Brother?" cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to Mariston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, hello, Nahum," answered Mariston. "Fraternal</seg><seg type="columnLine">greetings, Most Worshipful Sir. Yes, I've got thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds of the stuff in my pack here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then Troyana is saved!" was the joyous rejoinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Nahum and Zephaniah.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mariston grounded his rifle and slid out of the sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">penders of his pack. He tossed it to Nahum. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Junior Warder fumbled with the straps for an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then rose, the light of victory in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is here!" he cried. "Come, we will start the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectors!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Followed by Zephaniah, he ran behind the battle line</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the room which housed the emergency power</seg><seg type="columnLine">unit adjoining the assembly hall. The two men disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared from view. Mariston raised his rifle and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed firing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For another five minutes the battle raged. Then from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge tube mounted on top of the. power unit came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce red light. Like an avenging flame it swept down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ranks of the Burden Bearers and in its wake was</seg><seg type="columnLine">death and destruction. Robes burst into flames and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickening smell of burning flesh permeated the air. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">cries of terror, the cohorts of Amos turned and fled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A second ray joined the first. Side by side the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">beams of red swung over the battlefield and where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed was left no living thing. The Burden Bearers</seg><seg type="columnLine">left alive fled with cries of fear through the gap they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made in the sanctuary walls and sought haven in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower levels. In a minute the courtyard was free from</seg><seg type="columnLine">living enemies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rifle fire had ceased. There was nothing left to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot at. Nankivell grounded his rifle and wrung Maris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton and Willis by the hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You got my message?" he asked uselessly. "Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, I know you did. I was sure you'd come, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">you sure got here in the nick of time. Another ten min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes and it would have been just too bad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Glad to see you, old man," cried Mariston, his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Nankivell's shoulder. "Ray and I were afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was your ghost when we heard your voice on Dune's</seg><seg type="columnLine">trick receiver. We started at once and we won through,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although we lost every man of our followers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me ask you a question," broke in Willis. "Did</seg><seg type="columnLine">you rescue Estha all right? We'd have come after you</seg><seg type="columnLine">that morning if you hadn't stolen all of the ammunition</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Estha is safe," replied Nankivell. "Of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd have come, you darned fool, but I did better alone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew what I was about."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For a wonder," laughed Willis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">78</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose you and Estha are married long ago?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nankivell's face fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he said, "we aren't. The Master couldn't see</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, at least not until Amos was defeated and our rule was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reestablished."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In that case, I hear wedding bells chiming," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willis with a chuckle. "How about it, Bob?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope so," laughed Mariston. His face grew sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly sober and he looked at Nankivell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Frank," he said hesitatingly, "Balkis--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is still alive and will probably thrash you for wot</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming back with me two years ago. She--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zephaniah stood before them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Worshipful Brother Mariston, and you, Brother Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lis," he said ceremoniously, "to you are the thanks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Troyana due for your rescue of her in her extremity. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">gift that our city affords will be denied you. You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">but to ask and you shall receive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll talk that over later, Most Worshipful Sir,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Mariston brusquely. "Meanwhile Brother Willis</seg><seg type="columnLine">has another thirty pounds of cobalt. You had better</seg><seg type="columnLine">take it and get busy. There is work yet to be done!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Work?" asked Zephaniah in puzzled tone as he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pack which Willis handed him and tossed it to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Planner who stood near by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, important work. You've got Amos on the run;</seg><seg type="columnLine">now keep after him. Don't give him a chance to bolster</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his men's morale which is shot to pieces right now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gather every man and we'll go after him where he lives.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Get your flashtubes ready."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden glow illuminated the Master's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those are words of wisdom," he said. "Every flash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube is empty, but with the energy you have brought, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can recharge them all in an hour. Then we will be ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to march."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Meanwhile," added Nankivell, "you had better close</seg><seg type="columnLine">that door through which we went down below."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is being done by Brother Jereboam," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Master. "He will close it and also drop fourteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergency doors, each one hundred feet thick, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top and bottom of each flight of steps leading below. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">need fear nothing further from that quarter. Now if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brothers Mariston and Willis will come with me, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will prepare for the attack."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After wre settle Amos we'll talk about what to do to</seg><seg type="columnLine">those chaps down below," said Nankivell. "Meanwhile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can load the flashtubes without us. I want to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Estha and I fancy that my friends have someone they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would like to see as well.

They walked through cheering ranks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Planners and Craftsmen who strove to do honor to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescuers. As they passed through the doorway into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast hall, the din of cheering was left behind. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner shrine, the entire concourse were on their knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Jereboam stood before the altar, offering thanks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Great Architect for the aid he had vouchsafed the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">city. They paused until the prayer was ended. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kneeling throng rose to their feet, Nankivell spoke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Estha!" he called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jereboam turned at the words and saw them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Honor be to those to whom honor is done!" He cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a ringing voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Women of Troyana, do honor to Worshipful</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brother Mariston and to Brother Willis for the trials</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have undergone and for the aid they have rendered."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, stow that," exclaimed Willis uncomfortably.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mariston grinned at him quizzically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better get used to it, Ray," he advised laughingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They're going to make a hero of you in spite of all you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say or do, so you might just as well like it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Four of the women came forward. Before Mariston</seg><seg type="columnLine">they dropped on their knees while one of them spoke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Worshipful Sir," she said, "the humble thanks of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">women of Troyana-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Help!" cried Mariston faintly, while Willis and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell grinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better get used to it, Bob," said the latter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mariston stepped forward and raised the leader of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deputation from her knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I appreciate your gratitude," he said, "but really,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're thanking the wrong man. Ray Willis is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who is really responsible for our being here. Please</seg><seg type="columnLine">favor him with your attention for a while. He likes it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brother Nankivell and I have serious business to at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tend to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman caught Willis' hand and raised it to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips. Mariston and Nankivell hurried away with Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lis' cry of "double-crossers" ringing in their ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was a dirty trick, Frank," chuckled Mariston,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but I know you went to see Estha and I've waited two</seg><seg type="columnLine">years to see Balkis. I wonder where she is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll find out from Estha, old man. She's in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alcove to the north of the oriental throne. Now buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, for I think you have another installment of hero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worship coming. Such are the penalties of grandeur."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He led the way to the alcove where Estha was wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, her face aglow with joy mingled with anxiety.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Are you hurt, Frank?" was her first question.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nothing serious," he replied. "I got a dig in my leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I'll let you bandage, although it has quit bleeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">already. If it hadn't been for Bob Mariston here, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">name would have been Dennis sure enough. I really</seg><seg type="columnLine">think you had better go down on your knees to thank</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He expects it and he likes that sort of stuff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He winked as he spoke. Estha and a girl who stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind her in the dark shadows dropped on their knees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Estha reached for Mariston's hand with the evident in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention of kissing it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Frank Nankivell, I'll wring your neck!" cried Maris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton as he leaped for his companion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a hero, any way you look at it, Bob," cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell as he dodged the attack. "You might just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well like it. Come on, Estha, we'll leave Worshipful</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brother Bob to the tender mercies of his admirers for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a while. I want you to bind up my leg."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He caught her by the hand and lifted her to her feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a parting laugh at Mariston's rueful countenance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he led her away to the main hall, leaving Mariston to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face the still kneeling girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Really now," protested Mariston, "I wish you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't kneel to me like that. I'm not used to it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides-"</seg><seg type="columnLine">TROYANA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">79</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice trailed off into silence as the girl looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. He stared at her unbelievingly for an instant and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a wave of color passed over his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Balkis!" he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Balkis looked at him shyly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "May I not thank you, Worshipful Sir," she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"for what you have done for Troyana and for my coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trymen ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Balkis," he exclaimed, a note of pain in his voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Am I 'Worshipful Sir' to you? You didn't use to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">such formality."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But then you were not one whom the wearers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purple had seen fit to honor as one who merited the</seg><seg type="columnLine">homage and thanks of all," she answered, her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">averted. "Now it is fitting that I kneel to humbly offer</seg><seg type="columnLine">you thanks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mariston stepped forward and raised her to her feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you're going to act like that, I'm going to be sorry</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I came back here," he said. "Balkis, I've longed</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much to see you. Aren't you just a little glad to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Surely I am glad to see my city's rescuer," she an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered with downcast eyes. "Never was any one more</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome than you are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Welcome because I brought aid?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why else, my lord?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mariston turned away, a wry expression on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose so," he said. "Naturally you were glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see Amos and his followers thrust back where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">belong. Well, we're going down after them in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes. An hour should suffice to restore the rule of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Master without any serious fighting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fighting?" she exclaimed faintly. "Must there be</seg><seg type="columnLine">more fighting?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A little, I'm afraid. Amos will fight to the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditch and so will a few of his followers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Must you go?" she asked. "You have done enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cannot you stay here and let the others fight the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not by a long shot!" he declared. "I wouldn't miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">the final windup for anything. I haven't done any</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting at all yet. This may be a first-class scrap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why shouldn't I go?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As my lord wills," she answered. "Who am I that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wishes should influence one of your exalted rank?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MARISTON turned back toward her, an expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pain on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't expect a greeting like this from you, Balkis,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "I came back here when Nankivell called to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring aid to him and to my brothers. I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">come for that reason, but I had another thing which</seg><seg type="columnLine">urged me more strongly even than loyalty. Hardly had</seg><seg type="columnLine">I left Troyana two years ago than I realized that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown away any chance of happiness that the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">might hold for me. I realized how utterly wrong and</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolish I had been when I told Nankivell that a mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riage between him and Estha would not bring happi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. My heart was sore at my folly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When I found that he and Estha had outwitted me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that she had fled with him, I rejoiced for them, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">my heart bled the more. In trying to save them, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered my own heart as a sacrifice and it had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vain one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Had the opportunity been mine I would have re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned, but the way was forever closed to me. Then and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">there I swore that if the way should ever open, I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to Troyana, never to leave again. When I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell's message, my heart leaped with a throb of</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy, for I knew that if I lived to win through, I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">see you again. I dreamed of many ways in which you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would greet me, but never of a way like this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And why did my lord wish to see his humble hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maiden?" asked the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Need I tell you, Balkis? It was because I loved you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because you were more to me than all else in the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Your face has been before me day and night and your</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice has rung in my ears. I came back here that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might say to you those words I foolishly choked back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words, 'I love you.' Balkis, I have won through to</seg><seg type="columnLine">your side. Now I avow my love for you and ask you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be my wife. Will you take me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Surely, my lord," she replied. "Could any maid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Troyana refuse anything which the rescuer of her city</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked? Did not Jereboam order us to honor you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to grant your desires? Surely I will wed with you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my lord, and count myself honored."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A groan burst from Mariston's lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is not for gratitude that I wish you to marry me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Balkis," he cried. "Unless you love me, don't offer</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself as a sacrifice on the altar of gratitude, for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would make neither of us happy. Tell me, do you love</seg><seg type="columnLine">another ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How could I think of love for another when my lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">has honored me by offering to wed with me, a humble</seg><seg type="columnLine">maid who is nothing, unless my lord thinks that being</seg><seg type="columnLine">born in the blue is a virtue. Surely, but one love could</seg><seg type="columnLine">fill my heart, love for him who braved all dangers to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to the rescue of my hardly pressed countrymen."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let gratitude be," cried Mariston hoarsely. "Answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">me plainly. Is there one whom you love?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, my lord," she said faintly. "There is one whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have loved for years, one who I have prayed would</seg><seg type="columnLine">one day favor me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mariston bowed his head. He raised it again in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, a rare smile showing through the pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I might have known," he said softly. "I wish you</seg><seg type="columnLine">every happiness with the man of your choice, Balkis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am sorry that it had to turn out so, but if you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy, I shall be content. Who is he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is one who might have had me long ago for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking, but who steeled his heart against me and left me</seg><seg type="columnLine">desolate. For that I vowed that I would one day punish</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Have I done so?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why--who--what do you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Balkis raised her head and allowed her glorious eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look full into his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Oh, Bob, you silly boy," she cried, laughter and tears</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her voice, "don't you know? It's you, dearest, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">always been you.

Their paths coincided</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a few hundred yards. They came to an intersecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage and Zephaniah halted them while he spoke to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mariston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your path turns left here," he said.

"I feared that Amos had secured an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other supply of power and might meet us in the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">city outside the sanctuary.

We've lost enough men already."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, and they are men whom we can ill spare for</seg><seg type="columnLine">they can be replaced but slowly. The Great Architect</seg><seg type="columnLine">grant that our losses are at an end."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In silence the detachment marched on. Horizontal</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveyors ran through the walls paralleling their line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of march, but it was no part of Zephaniah's plan to place</seg><seg type="columnLine">power on any devices outside the walls of the sanctuary</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he had to. Any power he supplied would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally at the command of Amos. At last the column</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused before a recess in the wall. Before them was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an empty vertical conveyor. At a word from the Master,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell and fifty of the nobles crowded into the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. Nankivell set the control lever for maximum</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed downward, at the same time setting the automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop which Avould bring the car to rest at the level of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amphitheater.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All ready," he reported to Zephaniah.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Master pressed a button on a box which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried in his hand. A disc on its front glowed green</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Zephaniah spoke clearly toward it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Power on, please," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardly had the words left his lips than the car shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">down with sickening speed. Nankivell caught at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">control lever with a groan. Before he had time to move</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, the downward acceleration ceased and the car began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to slow down. It stopped with a sudden jerk. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy stone block which shut it off from the lower city</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved aside automatically. Before them lay an empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">passageway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come out quickly!" cried Nankivell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He set the example by springing out into the empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor. One man remained in the elevator. As soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it was empty, the stone block slid in front of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Spread out in a skirmish line!" cried Nankivell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men who had come with him ran down the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridor in both directions, dropping prone at five yard</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervals. In a moment the stone block slid to one side</seg><seg type="columnLine">and another fifty men joined him. It was only a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of minutes for the third contingent under Zephaniah to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter the corridor. As the Master emerged he turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What was that noise?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It sounded like a flashtube in the distance." re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied Nankivell. "The other bodies are probably en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaged."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then there is no time to be lost," cried Zephaniah.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Form in column and follow me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He led the way at a swinging run down the passage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For three hundred yards they met with no resistance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They swung around a corner. Before them were three</seg><seg type="columnLine">black-clad figures, evidently sentries. At the sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gorgeously attired column, they gave cries of alarm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fled away. The intermittent crash of flashtubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be heard quite plainly now and several times the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp crack of a rifle punctuated the noise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here is where we meet resistance, if ever!" cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Master.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the column at his heels, he burst into the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">82</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">amphitheater with its seating capacity of thousands. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">they passed the doorway, a blinding flash of light filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hall and they were hurled to the ground by a ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rific crash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a moment they could see nothing. Gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scene cleared. On the floor before them lay a</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of Burden Bearers evidently caught by the. crash</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had greeted them on their entrance. Further back</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood another larger group, hesitating whether to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ground or to fly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Charge them!" cried Nankivell. "One good charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they'll break and run!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He sprang to his feet and raced across the floor as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke, the nobles of Troyana trailing after him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitating group broke and fled at their approach. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheers, the men following Nankivell raced on. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the middle of the great hall. Suddenly there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a sound which froze the marrow in Nankivell's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones. Above the sound of shouting came a sharp hiss.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A spark floated through the air from the seats on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite side of the hall and made its way toward them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Scatter!" he cried. "Scatter out and take cover!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Obediently they scattered, but not soon enough. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">spark burst and thousands of tiny whorls of light floated</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward, death in the touch of each of them. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they landed, inspiration visited Nankivell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Flashtubes!" he shouted. "Fire a couple of tubes up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He set the example by discharging one of his tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air. All of the sparks in the vicinity of the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge died out in darkness. Others followed his exam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple and the menace was temporarily over. Another hiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from the seats and a half dozen sparks floated up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Flashtubes again!" cried Nankivell. "Hit them be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore they burst!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The air was torn by the thunder of discharging tubes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell did not use his. He rapidly unslung his rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brought it to his shoulder. Again came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">menacing hiss but mingled with it came the crack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell's weapon. A figure rose from the distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">seats and fell forward to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Again and again Nankivell's rifle cracked. The hiss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing kept up steadily but the carefully aimed flashtubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the nobles of Troyana killed the tiny sparks before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had time to burst and spread death and destruction</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadcast. There was a momentary lull in the fighting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A dull plop was heard behind them. Nankivell looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and a hoarse cry of alarm came from his lips. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dais behind them where stood the Golden Calf was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a group of men attired in the dress of the long-sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobles of Atlantis. As he looked, one of them hurled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small round object to the amphitheater floor. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">another dull plop. A cloud of light green gas could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen emerging from the two spheres on the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Nankivell swung around and leveled his rifle at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">group on the dais. Before he had time to fire, a fateful</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiss came from behind him. The crash of flashtubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him that his followers had seen and were combating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the menace. He leveled his rifle and fired. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'figures on the dais dropped, but a volley of the deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas bombs came from above. The cloud was perilously</seg><seg type="columnLine">close.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Charge the seats!" came Zephaniah's ringing voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The nobles of Troyana turned and charged toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the section of seats from whence had come the deadly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sparks. They were within a hundred yards of it when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen dull green spheres flew through the air to break</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of them. They were caught between two clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the deadly gas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the north!" cried Zephaniah.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They swung to the left and raced toward the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the hall. From directly behind them came an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other hiss and the air was alive with the malignant</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparks. They did not pause to reply to the fire but fled</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the north. They had almost reached the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">tier of seats when a cloud of black-robed figures rose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept down on them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The nobles met the attack with the crash of flashtubes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The front of the attack melted away, but for every Bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den Bearer who fell, two rose to take his place. Behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them rolled the deadly gas while overhead the terror-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspiring sparks writhed through the air as if in intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligent pursuit of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Make a stand, men!" cried Nankivell. "It's all we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can do!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dropped to the floor and cuddled the rifle to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheek. The group on the dais were still plainly visible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He lined his sights on them and fired. An Atlantean</seg><seg type="columnLine">noble fell headlong. He reloaded but did not fire as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">futility of it struck him. The deadly cloud of gas was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a few feet away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden shout, faint and far distant, came from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">south side of the hall. Mingled with it was the crack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a rifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ray Willis!" cried Nankivell, joy vibrant in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He threw up his rifle and fired rapidly. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seats where the deadly fire of sparks had rained on them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fresh volley rose from the air, but mingled with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hissing came the crash of flashtubes and the crack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willis' rifle. Taken iw flank, the entrenched sleepers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were doomed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a shout, Zephaniah led his men against the wav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering Burden Bearers before him. They fought bravely</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment before they broke and fled in all directions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankiveil's rifle spoke as rapidly as he could work his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolt and fire. The defeat had been suddenly changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to victory but for one thing. The deadly cloud of gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">was creeping steadily nearer. Nankivell began to cough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid they've got us!" he cried to Zephaniah.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as he spoke he became aware that the gas was</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing less dense. It seemed to be retreating from</seg><seg type="columnLine">them rather than advancing. Above the din of battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could hear a distant hum and a sigh as of rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. He looked inquiringly at Zephaniah.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are saved!" cried the Master. "Hosea has</seg><seg type="columnLine">captured the generator unit. He has seen our peril</seg><seg type="columnLine">through observers and he has started the largest com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressors. They will change the air in this hall in four</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes when driven at top speed. Let us attack the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dais."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At his call, his men rallied about him and started an</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance toward the distant dais on which stood the figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Golden Calf. From the west side of the hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">another body of men entered and advanced toward them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nankivell gave a cry of joy. In the lead ran Mariston.1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three bodies met in the center of the great amphi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">theater. "Willis and Mariston grasped Nankivell's hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmly, but there was no time for congratulations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the dais came a stir of movement and a dull violet</seg><seg type="columnLine">light flashed through the air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">TROYANA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">83</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At Zephaniah's command the nobles of Troyana scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered and ran toward the dais. Hardly had the ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vance started than it ceased. Everyone in the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood frozen with horror. Through the air, pulsing like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a malignant living entity came a sound, a sound of fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and terror. Distant and yet near, it filled the hall, ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mering away at the brains of the hearers as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">drilling holes through the living tissue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Drums!" came a wailing cry. "The Hooves of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Calf! Woe! Woe! Woe!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damn!" shouted Willis. "Amos must have snagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">some power somewhere. Shoot, men, shoot all you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. Good work, Bob, the Maristons always could</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot. Where's Nankivell ? Oh, there you are young-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster. Keep your eyes open, they'll charge in a minute!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He threw up his rifle and fired again and again with</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly accuracy. The violet ray was roaming over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor of the amphitheater. Fully half of the nobles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Troyana were standing frozen in their tracks, paralyzed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the strange ray. Willis leaped to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come with me, Frank!" he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With Nankivell at his heels he turned and raced back</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the seats. Nankivell realized his strategy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a whoop of joy. In a few moments they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the seats and were climbing rapidly upward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the elevation they had gained, they could overlook</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dais.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, youngster, don't waste a shot!" cried Willis</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he dropped prone. "You fire at the men, I'll take</seg><seg type="columnLine">their damned machine!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NANKIVELL fired steadily. The range wras not</seg><seg type="columnLine">great and his weapon took a terrific toll of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantean nobles. Willis fired slowly, taking a careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">and deliberate aim with each shot. The third time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired, the violet light winked out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hurrah!" cried Nankivell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> .&lt;.&lt;Don t. cheer yet' that be only a stall," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willis grimly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reloaded and fired again. A blinding flash came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the dais and the device from which had come the</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet beam burst into fragments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With shouts of triumph the handful of Troyanans</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had escaped the deadly paralyzing ray charged at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the platform. The remnants of the court of Atlantis met</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, weapons in hand. For a moment the fight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an even one, but above the ring of steel on steel came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady crack-crack-crack as Mariston's pistol woke to</seg><seg type="columnLine">life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Willis and Nankivell ran down the tiers of seats and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scurried across the floor. They raced up the steps to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dais to find the fight over. The last of the sleepers</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay prone on the platform. Barely thirty of the nobles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Troyana were still on their feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This battle has cost us dearly," said Willis as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked around the amphitheater where hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue and yellow robed figures lay sprawled on the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those men are all right," laughed Nankivell. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple ray paralyzes, but it doesn't kill. A reduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge from a flashtube will bring them around in good</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape. We've won with little loss."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He advanced toward Zephaniah. As he reached his</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, the Master raised his hand and pointed dramatically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the altar at the foot of the huge misshapen Golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Calf stood a solitary figure attired in a robe of bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant crimson heavily embroidered with gold. On his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">breast there flashed the golden jewel of a Master.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Amos!" cried Nankivell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He raised his rifle but Zephaniah placed a restraining</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand on his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lower your weapon, Brother Nankivell," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The archtraitor must be taken alive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waved back his followers and advanced alone to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the altar. Amos watched him with a grim expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of malevolence on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Amos!" cried the Master. "The fate which Gedaliah</seg><seg type="columnLine">prophesied has overtaken you. Alone and helpless, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are left to face the wrath of the Master whose authority</seg><seg type="columnLine">you flouled and whose place you strove to usurp. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have come to the end of your treachery. Lay down</seg><seg type="columnLine">your arms, if you bear any, for further resistance will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not avail. The Council will decide your fate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Amos drew himself up and answered in a ringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice which filled the entire hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Zephaniah!" he said. "Upstart who sits in the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">throne which is mine by right, victory will avail you</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. Defeated, I will yet bring victory from de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feat. Hearken! The Hooves of the Calf spell yfeur</seg><seg type="columnLine">doom!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the silence the demoniac drumming again filled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air until it seemed that the heads of the hearers would</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst from sheer agony. The sound died down for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant and Amos' voice could be heard again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For you, Zephaniah, the Calf has called. For all</seg><seg type="columnLine">your vaunted wisdom, there are things of which you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are ignorant. Advance to the altar, if you dare, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">invite the Calf to choose between us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fearlessly, Zephaniah strode up to the altar. Face</seg><seg type="columnLine">to face he stood with Amos. On the breast of each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them was a symbol of power and authority. The crim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son robes of Amos and the blue robes of Zephaniah each</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore the same symbols of majesty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "At last, usurper, we stand face to face," cried Amos.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let the Calf judge between us and, mayhap, take us</seg><seg type="columnLine">both to our doom."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Look out, Zephaniah!" cried Willis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  His pistol flew up and spurted flame, but he was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late. Amos had stooped and touched a button on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base of the image. There was a blinding flash and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosion which shook the hall.

But, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazed and demoralized by the force of his over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw, no bones are found to be broken and</seg><seg type="columnLine">old "Doc" gathers up his scattered impedimenta</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turns painfully to continue the battle afoot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All of which is a somewhat verbiose preamble to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the statement that Richard Seaton is still will-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and able to defend his customary mode of</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Robb is clever. She writes forcibly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, and I am gratified indeed that such a one</seg><seg type="columnLine">pays me the compliment of enjoying my efforts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must admit that by her judicious selection and</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentration of words and expressions from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories she has composed a sour symphony in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed. But when it is considered that she has</seg><seg type="columnLine">culled those expressions from some two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty thousand words, it becomes clear that lier</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture is not quite in true perspective. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same line of thought, I may be allowed to point</seg><seg type="columnLine">out that while a dilute solution of vanilla is</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant to the senses, yet the concentrated 20X</seg><seg type="columnLine">extract is so violently nauseous as to be almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">unrecognizable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before I proceed to a general defense, I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer Miss Robb's one direct question. Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Robb, I can explain that point. I will point</seg><seg type="columnLine">out first, however, that you are wrong in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">statement that not a single one of the foreigners</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke English as Seaton spoke it. Dunark</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke precisely as Seaton did, because their</seg><seg type="columnLine">brains had been imprinted one upon the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The others did not speak as he did because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught them pure English instead of the sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of language he himself used in his everyday</seg><seg type="columnLine">life--he taught them the form of speech he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other educated men used in public.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now to the defense. Concerning repetition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is deliberate. If Miss Robb will do a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of observing, she will notice that certain ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressions are characteristic of certain men, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in every-day life those expressions are re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated over and over again. In Seaton's con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation I drew faithfully a living scientist, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ph.D., in chemistry, word for word. I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberately so wrote Seaton's character and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonality into those stories; partly to lend veri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">similitude to a highly improbable tale, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">mostly in protest against the stereotyped, stilted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and utterly unnatural conversation forced upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unfortunate scientists portrayed in all too</seg><seg type="columnLine">many stories. For I have known personally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have worked with and have played with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of highly trained specialists in sci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence, whose degrees use up the alphabet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of them, in their everyday conversations</seg><seg type="columnLine">with friends and fellow-workers, talk like</seg><seg type="columnLine">human beings. Most of them really arc human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings. In fact, one eminent man--whose name</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of you would recognize if I were at liberty</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give it--swears like a pirate upon the golf</seg><seg type="columnLine">links and in his conversation habitually mixes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same sentence words which drive college</seg><seg type="columnLine">graduates to the dictionary and the latest cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent slang. I might also add that the man from</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom Crane was drawn is one of the few</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists of my acquaintance, who never lapses</seg><seg type="columnLine">into colloquial language when talking in small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly groups. Scientists as a class can, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in public generally do, choose their words with</seg><seg type="columnLine">care; but in their laboratories they do not, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purported intimate conversations of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists in many stories not only bores most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us to extinction, but also destroys in great</seg><seg type="columnLine">part the illusion of reality which the authors</seg><seg type="columnLine">are trying to create.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So far, I have been upon firm ground. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have known what I was talking about, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a large enough number of observations so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the probable error in my result is small.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, when I attempt to defend ray use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the term "cuddle-pup," to which Miss Robb</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects so vigorously, I cannot fall back upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the law of averages, since my romantic experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence has been limited, but must cite the results</seg><seg type="columnLine">of only one series of experiments. This, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, is indefeusible from a scientific stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">point, and is justifiable only by the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the census enumerator undoubtedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">counted Miss Robb as only one individual, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas should not be allowed any more weight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">than those of the subject of my experiments--</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have been married to that subject for prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably as long a time as Miss Robb has lived. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of that, we are still in love with each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other--so much so that we play together as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">twosome, by choice. And lest Miss Robb con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clude that the subject must be in some sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">abnormal, I will adduce the following data, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which may be proved:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In golf, she shoots around 90 consistently</seg><seg type="columnLine">(she has been women's champion of our city</seg><seg type="columnLine">for six or seven years), is an excellent swim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer, and quite an athlete generally. She is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a splendid dancer, and has never known what</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is like to be a wall-flower. She is also able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold her own in club debates and discussions</seg><seg type="columnLine">which call for serious reading and original</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking. While she is too old-fashioned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke cigarettes or to drink alcoholic liquor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she has so handled things that we and our</seg><seg type="columnLine">children enjoy a real home life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I have called this subject "cuddle-pup"</seg><seg type="columnLine">(and many other things not mentioned in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories) for years, with no unpleasant results.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore, I felt no hesitation in having my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hero use such terms. It may be, however, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">that particular expression carries a connotation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vulgarity to the younger generation which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">does not carry to me, and which it most em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phatically was not intended to carry to anyone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If so, and if there is expressed in these columns</seg><seg type="columnLine">any general sentiment against such pet names,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shall certainly refrain from using them in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories henceforth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">              Edward E.

This is a false</seg><seg type="columnLine">assumption, for absolute zero does not exist</seg><seg type="columnLine">anywhere in the universe.

Campbell, Jr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We start from page 69 of Eddington's "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nature of the Physical World." Discussing</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Time's Arrow," the thing that makes us sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">past and future, he says: "If . . . we find</seg><seg type="columnLine">more and more of the random element in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of the world, then the arrow is pointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the future.; if the random element de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creases the arrow points to the past." Again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">page 74, he says "the practical measure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">random element which can increase in the uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse, but can never decrease is called entropy</seg><seg type="columnLine">On page 78, he says that when the final equili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brium is reached, when "shuffling" is complete,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"we lose time's arrow." There is no past or</seg><seg type="columnLine">future. 'Time exists, but docs not pass. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">universe is static, in the famous warmctod.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Let us summarize this. Entropy was intro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced to science as a useful, if rather mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">function in thermodynamics. Like most such</seg><seg type="columnLine">functions, its use has since then enormously</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased. Let it suffice to confirm its sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificance in the present problem. It is this: if</seg><seg type="columnLine">entropy (randomness or "shuffling") increases,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are moving toward the future. If it de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creases, we are going into the past of the sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem in question. And in the far future the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuffling will have reached its maximum in</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter disorganization, and Time will cease to</seg><seg type="columnLine">flow. The universe will be static--run down--</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now, as has often been done before, consider</seg><seg type="columnLine">Time as a stream. In some places the speed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the current is greater or smaller than in others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the end it flows into a stagnant, Time-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less inland sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Good enough. Here we are, in our part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, drifting along at a definite speed. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where else the flow is swifter, relative to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, and Time passes into the future more</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly, entropy increases faster. Elsewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reverse is true, and relative to us Time</seg><seg type="columnLine">lags. If we were to pass into the first, swifter</seg><seg type="columnLine">system, and then return to our own, we might</seg><seg type="columnLine">live a lifetime there for a day or an hour or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second of our Time. Returning from a part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Space, where Time flows more slowly than in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ours, the reverse would be true. A day of life</seg><seg type="columnLine">there might be centuries here. We would land</seg><seg type="columnLine">far in the future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At first sight, this might seem a means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Time-traveling, but it is not. Time lost is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">regained. We can live a life-span in the faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">world and return to Earth decrepit, feeble</seg><seg type="columnLine">oldsters, while our little nephew has been aging</seg><seg type="columnLine">from five to six, months, or years, or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">days. After a few hours of pell-mell adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the slow world, we return to find our Earthly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives lost for good, and Earth celebrating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">holidays of five thousand or ten thousand years</seg><seg type="columnLine">hence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Do such places in Space exist? Have we</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence to show that such things are possible?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eddington supplies one example himself. Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is perfect equilibrium, where shuffling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">entropy, has reached a maximum, as in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interiors of some stars, Time will stand still.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But what of the others?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Remember, this speed of Time-flow is relative</seg><seg type="columnLine">to whatever reference we choose--Earth's rate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our case. Looking into a part of the Time-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream where the flow is slower, we drift past</seg><seg type="columnLine">a floating observer of that world, into his future,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where disruption has increased, and, to us, pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cesses that have a definite rate in our world</seg><seg type="columnLine">are happening faster there, are disorganizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster. For example, evolution progresses faster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">atoms disintegrate faster, men die sooner. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars are holocausts of disintegration and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">organization, and if their Time flows slower</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ours they should approach some state where</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is no flow at all, an equilibrium. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">know such "closed" stars, and Eddingtou shows</seg><seg type="columnLine">us that there Time stands still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The opposite case, of faster flow, remains.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The observer in that world is passing our</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant, and his past is coming toward us. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to move into his past. The processes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his world seem reversed to us. Life devolves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">men grow young, and atoms are born. One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the newest facts of physics is Millikan's dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery that the cosmic rays indicate the building</seg><seg type="columnLine">up of atoms somewhere in the universe! For</seg><seg type="columnLine">April, 1932</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the purposes of scientifiction, at least, I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">the likelihood of our proposition is established.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It remains for Dr. Breuer, or Dr. Smith, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Campbell to develop the idea in a story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is another consequence of this idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuffling as measuring the passage of Time, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we preserve the strict analogy with a pack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards that Eddington uses less strictly. Such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pack will approach a condition of complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">disorganization, but once there, if the shuffling</seg><seg type="columnLine">continues, there is no choice, but to become</seg><seg type="columnLine">more organized, to travel back in Time. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">can certainly be worked up into a useful mech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anism. Also, it is possible by repeated shuffling</seg><seg type="columnLine">to obtain a completed sorted pack again. Such</seg><seg type="columnLine">an occurrence has a definite, calculable prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability, small, but not zero. Suppose that</seg><seg type="columnLine">should happen to the universe. It would return</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its initial state at "creation," and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a nearly infinite number of possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">futures open to it. If the something that pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duces shuffling in the universe keeps on, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmctod need not be a real death, and, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">before reaching that static state, the universe</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be reborn and pursue any one of an enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous number of futures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have one word to add, with regard to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">International Scientific Association. Unavoid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able troubles necessitated reorganization and</seg><seg type="columnLine">consequent upheaval during the past year. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">is still going on, but order is being brought out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of chaos. However, the office of Secretary has</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed hands several times at very short</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice, and, as a result of the sum total of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbing elements, a large number of applica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions from the United States, Canada, and Eu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope have gone unanswered. As Foreign Di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rector and Acting Secretary, I now want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">apologize to all who have not been answered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to beg them to have patience and to write again</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they are still interested, and to assure them</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in any case their letters will receive per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal replies before very many weeks have</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed, as soon as the reorganization is complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the work of the various offices can be re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">distributed. I say this particularly to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">English applicants, who may have felt that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a bit too cautious about having members</seg><seg type="columnLine">in another country, the friendly rival of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own. I can only say that our name expresses</seg><seg type="columnLine">our purpose, and it is our earnest desire that</seg><seg type="columnLine">our first European Branch be established by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Englishmen, in England.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is little sense in criticising authors and</seg><seg type="columnLine">artists.

It appears, from Williamson's story,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that old age presupposes some idiosyncrasy or</seg><seg type="columnLine">contamination of the glands, which may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">abolished through the imbibing of some in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigorating liquor, say for instance, buttermilk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On what hypothesis lie bases this astounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">conclusion, I have been at a loss to discover;</seg><seg type="columnLine">inasmuch as the accepted concensus of opinion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">originating from actual experiences, deviated .in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bee-line to opposing facts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Old age is a glandular disease. Old age can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be alleviated by neutralizing the poisons in</seg><seg type="columnLine">glands.

Why not have taken his captive with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him? This is assuming there was only space</seg><seg type="columnLine">for two in the machine. Otherwise he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have taken the Captain as well. Believing as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did that the whole crew of the mother ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in Rolenski's pay, surely the presence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">two helpless and much wanted men would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciably increase the odds against him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Possibly, however, Mr. Vincent considers</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in the distant future, wherein his story is</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed, world atavism is gradually setting in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This would appear to be indicated by the low</seg><seg type="columnLine">standard of education of the major portion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his characters, and the officers and their sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinates.

I say "so-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> called," for these magazines attempt only to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> liave a sketchy scientific background to their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> yarns. Take "Strange Tales," for instance; its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> stories run to stirring action, usually with a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> strong and not always too well done love-theme,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> but with only the most meager amount of science.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whenever a story contains more than this mere</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> trifle o£ technical stuff, its readers immediately</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> set up a howl, in the department that corre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sponds to "Discussions." To my mind that re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> action smacks of a preference for trashy, light</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> reading.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Wonder Stories" is a bit better; I consider</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> it a cross between A.

As for "Weird Tales," I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> can only say that I consider its attempts at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> scientifiction a collection of fantastic nonsense,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> although when it sticks to its regular type of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> occult story it is unsurpassed.
