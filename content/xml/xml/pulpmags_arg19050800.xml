                    <ab>Any baby will be happy after a bath with Pears' Soap. It is because Pears' is a healing balm to all scalds and chafing which make baby uncomfortable and peevish.</ab>
                    <ab>By the continued use of Pears' Soap the tender skin of the infant becomes as smooth and soft as velvet and aglow with health and beauty.</ab>
                    <ab>The reason is that Pears' Soap is pure. It contains no poisonous or irritating ingredients. It would be impossible for Pears' Soap to be other than healthful.</ab>
                    <ab>Of All Scented Soaps Pears' Otto of Rose is the best.</ab>

                        <ab>The greatest, most profitable, most enjoyable vocation for young men and women of the right calibre is advertising. Never before has there been such a demand for the
                            skillful advertiser.</ab>
                        <ab>Consider that some 30,000 publications receive about a billion dollars annually for advertising; that hundreds of new houses depending on advertising are constantly
                            swelling the business ranks; that more millions are expended for booklets and other advertising literature; that countless new fortunes are being piled up through a
                            scientific use of printer's ink; that even staid old institutions from banks to law are joining in this great advertising race for more profit, and a faint idea will he
                            gained as to the splendid opportunities awaiting the skilled ad writer.</ab>
                        <ab>In the great work of fitting ambitious people to earn double and quadruple ordinary salaries, the Powell System of Correspondence Instruction stands alone. My graduates are
                            everywhere, filling the best positions, and showing what is in store for others. It is the only System heartily endorsed by America's advertising authorities and by the
                            greatest advertising journal in the world.</ab>
                        <ab>My two free books, "Net Results" and Prospectus, explain the situation and tell about the achievements of my graduates. They also indicate how business men can swell their
                            profits. For free copies address me.</ab>

                        <ab>Naturally it takes quite an extended stretch of imagination to believe that one is able in one year to take up the study of advertising, take part in an advertising
                            contest, and win out in competition with noted men in the business, conduct two successful advertising campaigns and become advertising manager of a daily paper.</ab>
                        <ab>These are the actual accomplishments in my case, and due entirely to the Powell System. It is my belief that any person who makes up his mind to study advertising, and who
                            "hustles while he waits," can do as I have.</ab>

                            $4000.00 a year. You have as much natural ability as a bond wrapper we educated for this business who is now advertising manager of a large company on $1200.00 a year.</ab>
                        <ab>You are as well educated as a newsboy taught to write advertisements who is now the head of a $250,000.00 corporation.</ab>
                        <ab>You have as much practical business experience as a physician we enrolled who is now making over $5000.00 a year as advertising manager. This is not a machine-like
                            institution where all are put through identically the same course of study. Each student's qualifications, education and past experience are taken into account, and he is
                            given the training he individually needs to make him a success in this business.</ab>
                        <ab>For those who are weak on English, we have a special course they must first go through, all the things you think are drawbacks you will easily overcome.</ab>

                    <ab>Richard Wallace is a young college graduate thrown upon his own resources in New York. He has failed in various pursuits, and has reached his last cent. At this crisis he is
                        notified that an uncle has died, bequeathing him a cattle ranch in the wilds of Arizona.</ab>
                    <ab>Wallace works his way to New Orleans, and there seeks to got money enough from the ranch to reach Arizona. He receives discouraging news from the foreman, Miguel, but no cash
                        in reply to his letter. Taking his last few dollars to buy a supply of food, he stows away on a freight train loaded with cotton for San Francisco, California.</ab>

                    <ab>SYNOPSIS OF CHAPTERS PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED.</ab>
                    <ab>The yacht Babbler, belonging to Brandon Burgess, the wealthy Wall Street speculator, lies across the pier from "the steamer Yantic. Both are ocean bound. Burgess and his
                        secretary, Horace Tarr, are to take a Mediterranean cruise. Two trunks, both marked H. T. in a diamond, are brought to the pier, ad- dressed to the Yantic and the Babbler
                        respectively. One is stenciled in red, and one in black.</ab>
                    <ab>The watchman's dog, excited by the constant ticking in one of the trunks, worries off their tags, which the watchman replaces in reverse order.</ab>
                    <ab>Helen Trainor, her invalid brother Calvin, and her aunt are to sail on the Yantic. Burgess, who is in love with Helen, decides to send Tarr on their steamer in case that he may
                        be of service. Tarr suggests his destitute cousin, Ben Crowding, as valet for Trainor. Crowding has been employed in Burgess' milk, which are shut down, and he is very bitter
                        against him. Tarr has met his cousin in suspicious places, and notices that he seems ill at ease in Burgess' presence.</ab>
                    <ab>While befriending a little Italian boy, Angelo, Tarr's attention is called to an old woman in the steerage who bears a striking resemblance to Brown, one of Crowding's
                        suspicious associates. Through Angelo, the old woman tries to discover Tarr's identity.</ab>
                    <ab>Miss Trainor finds the wrong trunk has been sent to her stateroom, and asks to have the right one, stenciled with a black H. T. in a diamond, sent up from the baggage-room.
                        Angelo searches for the trunks, and reports only a red label of the same style. Ho says something was moving in the trunk.</ab>
                    <ab>On his way back from the baggage-hunt Tarr overhears the conversation of some passengers. By a Marconigram they have learned that Burgess' stocks are rapidly falling, and that
                        he has left the city. Pondering this, he notices Angelo thrust a note into Crowding's hand. Crowding reads it and faints. In attending to him Tarr discovers a goad concealed in
                        Crowding's clothes, preventing him from lying down or even resting. In the stateroom Crowding seems terrified, and he obviously has some terrible secret that is preying upon
                        his mind, but which he refuses to divulge.</ab>
                    <ab>Up on deck Tarr finds Miss Trainor with the broker, Kinney, one of Burgess' rivals. An un- pleasant remark is passed between the men. Later Kinney insults Tarr, who boxes his
                        ears. The rumor is circulated that the quarrel occurred about Helen Trainor, and that Tarr has been sent to watch her by Burgess.</ab>
                    <ab>Tarr receives word that Crowding has become delirious, and after an interview with the old woman in the steerage has tried to break into the baggage hold. Going to his
                        stateroom, he finds Crowding raving about something which he must stop, and shrieking over and over again "Only a hundred hours."</ab>

                    <ab>SYNOPSIS OF CHAPTERS PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED.</ab>
                    <ab>Arthur Stanton, toastmaster of the freshman dinner at Old Orange College, is kidnapped by nine sophomores. They give him chloroform to keep him quiet, hut are horrorstricken to
                        find him dead on their hands. It seems that he had been stabbed with a dagger of glass, and the nine sophomores are summoned to President Cady's house, where Coroner Jackson
                        and Chief of Police Cottrell place them under arrest (they have already been suspended) for complicity in the murder of Stanton, who had been paying atten- tion to Effie
                        Hilton, in whom Courtney is also interested. Courtney is one of the nine, but fails to respond when his name is read off by Cottrell. It seems that he has been seen leaving
                        town, satchel in hand. A search of Courtney's rooms shows that his departure was hurried, and also results in the finding of the handle and upper portion of a glass dagger
                        among his things.</ab>
                    <ab>The eight sophomores present are placed under arrest, and a telegram is sent to Courtney. He appears on the following day under charge of officers sent to his native town,
                        whither he h3d gone believing himself expelled from the college by the rules already existing against hazing.</ab>
                    <ab>Professor Starling, an amateur detective, secretly undertakes the case, and decides chat the murder was committed by a woman. The clues seem to lead to Effie Hilton.</ab>
                    <ab>At the preliminary trial it is discovered that Miss Hilton had, in a spirit of perversity, refused Courtney's offer of marriage, telling him of a previous engagement to Stanton
                        which had been arranged in their childhood by their respective parents. Ormsby's testimony is the only direct evidence against Courtney, but the jury renders a verdict of
                        guilty.</ab>

                    <ab>Most liberal cigar PROPOSITION EVER MADE</ab>
                    <ab>All the time that you have been paying ten cents over the counter for a Panetela cigar, we have sold our Fedora Panetela, a cigar of exactly the same value, at 4c.</ab>
                    <ab>In fact, it was one of our standard brands that we sold successfully for many years to the leading jobbers at $40 per thousand.</ab>
                    <ab>But, as you know, our method was changed a long time ago and we came direct to smokers with our entire product at the same jobber's prices</ab>
                    <ab>Now we make you a special proposition:</ab>
                    <ab>The FEDORA Panetela is not only equal in every respect to the regular ten cent cigars at retail, but also better than any five dollar per hundred Panetela ever advertised.</ab>
                    <ab>Altogether, here is our FEDORA PANETELA.</ab>
                    <ab>Guaranteed superior to any $5.00 per hundred Panetela advertised, though the price is 20 per cent less.</ab>
                    <ab>Guaranteed superior to the 10c cigars sold by dealers.</ab>
                    <ab>Guaranteed to be made of pure Havana filler and high-grade Sumatra wrapper.</ab>
                    <ab>Guaranteed to be made in the cleanest of factories; to be absolutely free from any kind of flavoring matter.</ab>
                    <ab>Guaranteed to save half your cigar money, sometimes more, in comparison with regular retail prices.</ab>
                    <ab>Guaranteed TO PLEASE YOU or the trial COSTS YOU NOTHING.</ab>
                    <ab>OUR PROPOSITION: For $4.00 we will send you 100 Fedora Panetelas and our beautiful cigar catalogue. Rolled Reveries." that "tells you all about it." All transportation charges
                        prepaid. Smoke as many as you wish to find out whether they suit you or not. If not, or on comparison you don't think our claims are carried out, return what you have left, at
                        our expense, and we will refund every cent. The same proposition applies to 50 Fedora Panetelas at $2.00.</ab>
                    <ab>We do not sell cigars on credit, but we do guarantee your perfect satisfaction. Our strictly cash business bookkeeper's salaries, clerical work, makes no bad debts, and our
                        customers get the benefit in value.</ab>

                        these birds. The new 272ar/ln 12-gauge, Model No. 17 is a light, quick gun, made to meet the demand for repeating shot-guns of highest quality at a very moderate price. It is
                        similar to the Marlin Model No. 19 Grade A, except for its solid frame and straight grip stock.</ab>
                    <ab>Important improvements, such is the use of two extractors and a two-piece safety recoil block, make it the easiest, most reliable and best working gun in the market. Bored for

                        perfect trap gun, having every advantage of the single barrel. You sight over the center of your load -- not off at one side. You are not breaking your birds with the right

                    <ab>This, and every other Marlin has the unique solid top and side ejector features, which guarantee safety and prevent the ejected shell from flying in your face. The Marlin
                        Breechbolt keeps out water, twigs, leaves or sand. The shells are always dry and your Marlin in service. No other gun has this feature.</ab>

                        <ab>The African Kola Plant is Nature's Positive Cure for Hav-fever and Asthma. Since its recent discovery this remarkable botanical product has come into universal use in the
                            Hospitals of Europe and America as an unfailing specific cure for Hav-Fever and Asthma in every form. Its cures are really marvelous.</ab>
                        <ab>Mr. W. H. Kelley, 317 48th St., Newport News, Va., writes Jan. 23rd, was a helpless invalid and was cured of Hay-Fever and Asthma, by Himalya after 15 years' suffering.
                            Mrs. J.E. Nordyke, of Hill City, Kas., writes Jan. 25th, had Hay-Fever and Asthma for ten years and could get no relief until cured by Himalya. Mr. D.L. Cloven, 126 Morris
                            St., Philadel-phia, writes Jan. 16th, Doctors did me no good but Himalya cured me. Mr. W. F. Campbell, Sanbornville, N. H., also writes Feb. 6th, that Himalya cured his
                            son. Rev. Frederick F. Wyatt, the noted Evangelist, of Abilene. Texas, writes April 15th, 1905, I never lose an opportunity to recommend Himalya as it cured me of Hay-Fever
                            and Asthma and have never had any return of the disease.</ab>
                        <ab>Hundreds of others send similar testimony, proving Himalaya a truly wonderful remedy. As the Kola Plant is a specific constitutional cure for the disease. Hay-fever
                            sufferers should not fail to take advantage of this opportunity to secure a remedy which will positively cure them. To prove the power of this new botanical discovery, if

                        <ab>CATARACTS, and all other eye diseases which produce blindness, are caused by poor circulation of blood in the eye, the result of eye strain some time in the past.</ab>
                        <ab>It is folly to attempt to restore the usefulness of the eye by applying a knife to any of the delicate, intricate parts. Think of the pain, suffering, blindness and even
                            death that has been caused by the use of the knife on the eye.</ab>
                        <ab>I discoveied, several years ago, a method of restoring the natural circulation of blood to the eyes, which is so simple that a child can apply it.</ab>
                        <ab>When this treatment is applied it immediately removes all strain on the nerves and muscles of the eye, equalizing the circulation, thereby assisting nature in restoring the
                            eye to its normal functions.</ab>
                        <ab>Glasses are eye crutches. You have to wear them because your eyes are crippled.</ab>
                        <ab>After a course of my treatment you can discard your glasses (eye crutches) just like one can discard other crutches after recovering from a broken limb.</ab>
                        <ab>My book about eyes, sent free, tells all about it. and contains pictures of and letters from hundreds who have been cured.</ab>
                        <ab>A postal card will get the book, and I will give you my free advice if you will write me a short description of your case. Address Dr. Oreit Otieal, Suite 183, 52 Dearboru

                    <ab>This is the razor that is as different from any other razor as smooth is from rough. Made as true and fine as a watch.</ab>
                    <ab>With the Gillette Razor, shaving at home or when traveling will be found a comfort, not a torture. Saves time, money, delay, and the barber habit.</ab>
                    <ab>Adapts itself to any beard, shaves as smooth as velvet, never pulls, scrapes, cuts, or even irritates the most, tender skin.</ab>
