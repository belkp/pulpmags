            <seg type="columnLine">cause the mathematics involved would be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">meaningless to the average reader. Let it</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">noticed a thin crescent of light on the outer</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">men were robed very like the ancient Greeks</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and Romans, in the toga; and that the simi-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">larity was heightened by the sandals they</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">"Or we may be in the presence of Cicero.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> "Nonsense," he said, sharply. "No Greek</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the smaller species with which we are fam-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was to determine what new condition or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">what new food was responsible for their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">growth. As so far the millipedes appar-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ently lived only in the vicinity of South</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Orange, the field for investigation was com-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Whatever the biologists eventually discov-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">estimated. The ordinary millipede can run</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">time was the one thing the two committees</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> The force of what my companion said</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was apparent, and I was inclined to share</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his view. If it were the truth, we were un-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">doubtedly faced by the strangest situation</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">any man had encountered. Nevertheless,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that view of the situation held more hope</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">than any other I could imagine. If the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mound creatures were indeed Martians then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">their number was limited. If Captain Eddy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and I could outwit them--find some means</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of freeing our comrades--the struggle for</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">unequal, although I was sure the mound</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">creatures--whether Martians or natives of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">My companion told me that there were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about 150 of them living in an excavation</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the bluff, to which the openings in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mound were entrances. About half of them</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">went daily in the space ship to some point</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">west of the Holmes River, he said. As he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">for the coast, working our way through the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">approached the bluff on which the mound</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was located. We were aided by the fact</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that the force of gravity on Venus is almost</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a fifth less than on Earth, so that while we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">retained our strength on Venus we lost</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about one fifth of our weight. Consequent-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ly we were able to walk much more lightly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and to leap over obstacles which, on Earth,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">we would have had to climb painfully.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Moreover the weight of other objects was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">similarly reduced, so that 120 pounds could</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">be lifted with the same effort that would be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">required to raise 100 pounds on Earth.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> We lunched on the sap of a milk tree in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">me that the top of the bluff was constantly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">watched. He then outlined his own plan of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">where we were until after dark, when one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of us could try to penetrate the home of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">wished, during the two months he had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">watched the mound, that he were free to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">sponsibility as the only free colonist was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">so great that he had not risked it. Now that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">there were two of us he agreed with me</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that the effort must be made. At my in-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> As we were discussing this plan in whis-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">scratched and buffetted and finally torn</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">loose from the branches to which we were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">clinging. The resistance of the other trees</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slowed our fall somewhat, but I was thrown</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">clear of the tree when it finally crashed</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Before I could move two of the strange</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">later the bound form of Captain Eddy was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">placed beside me. I saw that he was un-</seg>
