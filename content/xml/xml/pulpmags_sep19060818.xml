            <seg type="columnLine"> When the mate came out a little later, and the sailor</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Harris mounted the rigging and surveyed the reef from</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">a pallid spot of green. Vaiti, who had followed him, flung</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">one arm round the mast, and, leaning outward toward</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the horizon, surveyed'the reef intently. Within that ring</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of foam--the grave of many a gallant ship that had sailed</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">might lie many thousands of pounds. The purchase of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> There was silence for the space of a minute or two, as the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the dream broke, and the rainbow fragments of that bubble</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of glory scattered themselves east and west. For across</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the bar of the level horizon slipped a small, pointed, pearl-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">colored sail, growing as they watched it, flying past, and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Vaiti flung herself round a backstay, and slid down to the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">followed, swearing fully and freely. It was evident to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">way Higgins can see to gain it is to get the support of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">THE opening of a new store in a community is always</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the signal for a transference of trade which is most</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">deceptive to the proprietor of the new establishment,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and if he is not a man of rare shrewdness and has not a natu-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ral faculty for credits, he will be sure to make the remark:</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">"My trade is good--'way beyond my expectations!"</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Judging from surface indications, this observation is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">warranted. But why? Because the new store always</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gets the customers who have accumulated debts or griev-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ances of some kind with the merchants who are already</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">established, and who have sifted out their customers.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Instead of considering this sudden influx of trade as an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">omen of prosperity it should be regarded in exactly the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">opposite manner, and so treated. Rightly considered, it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">is a red lantern sign of '' Danger Ahead.'' These rejections</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from the other and established merchants are generally</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shrewd enough to pay cash for the first or second and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">perhaps the third month, and then they begin to ask for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">credit. Generally this is done very adroitly, and the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">request at the start will be to allow the amount to run</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">"until Saturday night," or until "the first of the month."</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">When this time comes the game of partial payment will be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">begun. Generally this is done on the basis of special pleas,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">alleging sickness or some phase or other of "bad luck."</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">But one thing may be depended upon. This class of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">customers will play the game in a progressive ratio and see</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that the balance against them is increased week after week</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and month after month. What is the result?</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> When the storekeeper finally wakes up to the situation</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he will find that the customer has him at a disadvantage.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">"If I press him too hard," reasons the storekeeper, "I am</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">likely to lose the whole account, and therefore I must</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> There are few things more difficult in merchandizing</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">who is shrewd enough to accomplish this is too keen to get</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into such a situation with many of his customers. The</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the balance against them--or practically so. Not only</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">this, but he must have his clerks do likewise. This is not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">so easy a matter as it might seem, and in most cases the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that the merchant is finally forced to ask his jobber to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">generally speaking, is to think that by spreading out</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> I know one decidedly successful merchant</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">who determined to make his credits according</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to a fixed principle, and that he would not vary</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his system under any conditions. Nominally,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he was supposed to do a cash business, but at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">last felt that he must extend credit to a por-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tion of his customers. He did it in this way:</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He would not even discuss the opening of an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">account with a customer about whom he felt any doubt</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whatever; then, when the man came in to arrange for an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">account, the merchant asked him: "How much of a line</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cf credit do you wish me to give you?"</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> "Well, fifty dollars," responded the customer.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> "And now about the question of time?" inquired the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> "Make it sixty days," replied the customer.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> "Very well," answered the storekeeper, "I will give you</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">just what you ask for in the matter of credit, and will</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">make the memorandum right here on the ledger page which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">will carry your account. But let us understand one thing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">clearly, right from the start. You are not to ask me for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">five cents more than the amount of credit I have given you,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nor are you to ask me for an extension of time. Certainly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">you can't complain at my making this rule rigid, when</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I have given you at the beginning all .that you have</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">asked for. You have set your own stakes, and cannot</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reasonably resent it if you are asked to abide by them."</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">This system of credit worked admirably in the case of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">storekeeper to whom I referred, for the reason that he held</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">every customer rigidly to the limitations fixed at the outset.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Though the storekeeper should keep the most careful and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">constant watch upon every one in his employ, he should be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slow to accuse a clerk or any other member of his force of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dishonesty. Lax methods of accounting are often,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">if not generally, the cause of apparent discrepan-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cies which lead to suspecting crookedness on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">part of employees. The merchant who does not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">keep his books in a condition which will tell him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at any time just exactly his standing, to a dollar,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">is in a poor position to bring accusations against</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">sense in acting upon this impulse without solid</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">facts upon which to base the accusation. Many</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a merchant by hasty action of this sort has not</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">this course establish a proper sense of responsi-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bility, but it also promotes the feeling among his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">existence which does not suffer a loss of one to five per</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">first thing for the wide-awake storekeeper to do is to settle</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it with himself that not a dime's worth of goods shall go out</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">radical measure of throwing out the time-honored old-style</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">day-book, as a book of original entry, and substituting in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">its place the duplicate carbon-slip system. No matter</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">how frequently and emphatically he may tell his clerks to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">charge every item " if the house is on fire," they will sooner</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">or later begin to leave items uncharged, if the old day-book</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">system is adhered to. The clerk, for example, is standing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in front of the store, doing up a package of fruit for a charge</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">customer, when a carriage drives up and its occupant</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">beckons to the clerk to come to the edge of the curbstone.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">In the course of taking the order of the lady in the carriage,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he naturally forgets to charge the fruit which he hastily</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pushed into the hands of the other customer. If an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">instance of this kind has occurred once it has ten thousand</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">times in the history of storekeeping, and that is putting it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">very mildly. As a matter of fact, it is a daily occurrence</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in almost every town in the United States. There is no</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> At that moment he caught sight of Quarrier, and the</seg>
