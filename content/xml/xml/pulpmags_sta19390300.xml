        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Now came the climax of the whole</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">vivid blue fire circling it like tiny</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">satellites. The teamsters stood aghast,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">staring open-mouthed. In a little</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">streak of blue flame one of the spheres</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">flew to meet Dugan, burst in his face</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with a dazzling glare of white light,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blinding him. With an agonized yell</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he staggered forward, tripped, and lay</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">groveling, rubbing his seared eyes</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with his fists and whimpering like a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">scared pup. The Martian had directed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his dummy from the tent to fool Du-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gan, coming out in his true form to</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> The white flame blazed, three times,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and his bruisers were writhing about.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The Wimshurst machine was a twisted</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wreck beside shattered condensers,</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> As Lakjzt popped into the car be-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">tent I noticed that Von Tempski and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">two ring-hands were running toward</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">BUT Henderson had cared for that.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The half-dozen hands, including</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">through the gate and burn up the road</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> The rest of what happened that</seg>
