            <seg type="columnLine">stars will be visible at all times; because</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">there is, of course, no day and night in open</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">as tc Jhe visibility of the stars, is entirely</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">correct; it is probably true only in a limited</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the atmosphere absorbs a sufficient amount</seg>
