                    <ab>Because of the many requests for back issues of WEIRD TALES, the publishers do their best to keep a sufficient supply on hand

                    <ab>COMING NEXT MONTH</ab>
                    <ab>I FELT my breath catch in my throat as we came face to face in the moonlight. The general standard of beauty among the natives
                        of Brittany is high indeed, but in the girl who stood before me the very pinnacle of flawless perfection seemed to have been
                        reached.</ab>
                    <ab>Her features--but how can I describe that which transcends all description? Mere words seem futile and meaningless when applied
                        to that radiant creature who con- fronted us out of the mystery of the night. Her loveliness seemed more than human --and most
                        assuredly none of it was due to the "art which conceals art" in the esti- mation of the feminine mind. Her dark hair waved in
                        a profuse disorder of natural curls over her brow and neck. Her smooth skin was deeply tanned by exposure to the wind and sun.
                        Her cheap cotton frock would have seemed but a mere rag but for the superb lines of the figure beneath. Her shapely legs were
                        bare to the knees; her feet innocent of even the wooden sabots which the poorest of peasants usually wear. She seemed more
                        like some dryad of the woods than a mundane peasant-girl.</ab>
                    <ab>For some reason--possibly it was the memory of my own recent fears--her very calmness irritated me.</ab>
                    <ab>"What are you doing here?" I cried as sharply as my halting Breton would allow. "Don't you know that there are wolves
                        about?"</ab>
                    <ab>To my surprize she answered in the purest French:</ab>
                    <ab>"Assuredly, m'sieu, there are wolves. Have I not just now"--she hesitated-- "have I not heard them howling? And you--you did not
                        climb the Devil's Tomb- stone just to admire the view?" . . .</ab>
                    <ab>You will be fascinated with this posthumous thrill-tale by a late English master of weird fiction. It is an engrossing
                        novelette of the Ghoul Pack, the Barking Women of Josselin, and the struggle between a mother's love and an ancient curse. It
                        will be printed complete in the August issue of Weird Tales:</ab>
