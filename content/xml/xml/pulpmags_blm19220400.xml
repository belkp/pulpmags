                    <ab>Editor's Note. The Black Mask takes pride in presenting herewith what it considers to be not only J. S. Fletcher's masterpiece
                        in mystery writing, but, as well, the best detective novel that has made its appearance since the heyday of Conan Doyle and
                        Sherlock Holmes. Mr. Fletcher, as is well known, is the greatest living winter of mystery fiction. His earlier novel, "The
                        Middle Temple Murder," made a sensation upon its publication in America. We confidently believe that "Exterior to the
                        Evidence'' will duplicate its success.</ab>
