Much work, however, is still</seg><seg type="columnLine">left to be done. I wish to say here how</seg><seg type="columnLine">much we all appreciate the continued support of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">readers and their enthusiasm in supporting the mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">azine month after month.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the experimental period is over, and the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazine is on a fair road to success, much ground has</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet to be covered. For one thing, the magazine is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet on a paying basis, notwithstanding the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that 150,000 copies are printed monthly. The ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pense of publishing and distributing the magazine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and placing it on some 30,000 newsstands through-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the country is enormous. On the other hand, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes several years to establish a magazine with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advertisers, and while Amazing Stories now en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joys the confidence of a few advertisers, much re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mains to be done. Not until the magazine has some</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty or thirty pages of advertising will it be pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible to realize a profit on the publication.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> T believe you will appreciate a frank talk of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind, for the simple reason that after all it is really</seg><seg type="columnLine">your magazine, and is published at the present time</seg><seg type="columnLine">more for your benefit than for the benefit of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">publishers. It is with this thought in mind that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel I am not expecting too much when 1 ask that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you sign the blank helow, giving us the names and</seg><seg type="columnLine">addresses of as many of your friends as you think</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be interested in Amazing Stories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only by having additional readers can the maga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zine hope lo be put on a profitable basis. When we</seg><seg type="columnLine">print 150,000 magazines, that does not mean that</seg><seg type="columnLine">150,000 are sold. The publishers put out their ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazines on the newsstands, and only those that are</seg><seg type="columnLine">sold are paid for. Those that are not sold are re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned for crcdit. It is my idea, then, to send these</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned copies to your friends so that those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">have never seen the magazine may become acquaint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed with it and become steady readers. We believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">this is a small favor to ask, and of course, we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to have only the names of such of your friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">as have never seen the magazine before, and who,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you think, might be interested in Amazing Stories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After all, we are doing pioneer work with an en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely new and different kind of magazine, and must,</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore, have whatever assistance you can give us</seg><seg type="columnLine">by sending us good prospects and then let the mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">azine succeed on its own merits. If you do not wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">to mutilate the magazine, just copy the blank and</seg><seg type="columnLine">send it to us properly filled in.

The fact that it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely one-seventh of t he volume of the earth must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have accelerated its cooling to the temperature at</seg><seg type="columnLine">which life could begin.

Nor was it generally under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood that since Mars is older than our earth, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely a quarter of the superficial area, and re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">moter from the sun, it necessarily follows that it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only more distant from life's beginning but</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer its end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The secular cooling that must some day overtake</seg><seg type="columnLine">our planet has already gone far indeed with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighbor. Its physical condition is still largely a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery, but we know now that even in its equa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torial region the midday temperature barely ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaches that of our coldest winter. Its air is much</seg><seg type="columnLine">more attenuated than ours, its oceans have shrunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they cover but a third of its surface, and as its</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt</seg><seg type="columnLine">about either pole, and periodically inundate its tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate zones. That last stage of exhaustion, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us is still incredibly remote, has become a pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent-day problem for the inhabitants of Mars. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediate pressure of necessity has brightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">their intellects, enlarged their powers, and hardened</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hearts.

In this classic, one of the first great Mar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tian stories, the Martians make war upon our world with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">far-reacliing consequences. In it, Wells makes the point</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the actual Martian does not remotely resemble a hu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man being. This is excellent science, because after all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there is hardly a chance in a million that in the evolution</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Mars their intelligent beings should even suggest the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">human race. Evolutionists today agree that the human</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">race, in being endowed with its intelligence, was, after</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all, only a biological accident. There is no reason why</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">insects or some other species could not just as well be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the rulers of some planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Wells has often been condemned because of his pic-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tured ruthlessness of Martians, but, after all. why should</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they not be ruthlessf Are we not ourselves as ruthless</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when we dissect insects and low animals for our scien-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tific investigations? If there were a superior intelligence,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to which, by comparison, ours was as inferior as that of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a chicken compared to a man's, there would be no good</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reason why it should not be ruthless if it wanted to con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quer the planet for its orvn designs. We humans our-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">selves would not hesitate to do the same thing if we sent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an expedition, let us say. to the moon, if we found what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we considered a low species there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In any event, the " War of the Worlds" is a tremendous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">document that will remain a classic for centuries to come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">seas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And we men, the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures who inhabit this</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, must be to them at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least as alien and lowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as are the monkeys and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lemurs to us.

English readers</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of it first in the issue of Nature dated August</seg><seg type="columnLine">2. I am inclined to think that the appearance may</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been the casting of the huge gun, the vast pit</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunk into their planet, from which their shots were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired at us. Peculiar markings, as yet unexplained,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were seen near the site of that outbreak during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next two oppositions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The storm burst upon us six years ago now. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars approached opposition, Lavelle of Java set the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires of the astronomical exchange palpitating with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">candescent gas upon the planet. It had occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards midnight of the 12th, and the spectroscope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which he had at once resorted, indicated a mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous velocity towards this earth. This jet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire had become invisible about a quarter past</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve. He compared it to a colossal puiT of flame,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"as flaming gas rushes out of a gun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A singularly appropriate phrase it proved. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next day there was nothing of this in the papers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except a little note in the Daily Telegraph, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world went in ignorance of one of the gravest dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers that ever threatened the human race. I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have heard of the eruption at all had T not met</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ogilvy, the well-known astronomer, at Ottershaw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was immensely excited at the news, and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">excess of his feelings invited me up to take a turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him that night in a scrutiny of the red planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In spite of all that has happened since, I still re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member th.it vigil very distinctly: the black and</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent observatory, the shadowed lantern throwing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner, the steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticking of the clockwork of the telescope, the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">slit in the roof--an oblong profundity with the star</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust streaked across it. Ogilvy moved about, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible but audible. Looking through the telescope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one saw a circle of deep blue, and the little round</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet swimming in the field. It seemed such a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, so bright and small and still, faintly marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with transverse stripes, and slightly flattened from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the perfect round. But so little it was, so silvery</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm, a pin's head of light! It was as if it quivered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little, but really this was the telescope vibrating</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the activity of the clockwork that kept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet in view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I watched, the little star seemed to grow</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger and smaller, and to advance and recede, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was simply because my eye was tired. Forty mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions of miles it. was from us--more than 40,000,-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">000	miles of void. Few people realize the immensity</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of vacancy in which the dust of the material uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse swims.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Near it in the field, I remember, were three little</seg><seg type="columnLine">points of light, three telescopic stars infinitely re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mote, and all around it was the unfathomable dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of empty space. You know how that blackness</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks on a frosty starlight night. In a telescope</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seems far profounder. And invisible to me, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause it was so remote and small, flying swiftly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily towards me across that incredible distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing1 nearer every minute by so many thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of miles, came the Thing they were sending us, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thing that was to bring so much struggle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">calamity and death to the earth. I never dreamt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it then as I watched; no one on earth dreamt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that unerring missile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night, too, there was another jetting out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas from the distant planet. I saw it. A reddish</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash at the edge, the slightest projection of the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line, just as the chronometer struck midnight, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that I told Ogilvy, and he took my place. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">night was warm and I was thirsty, and I went,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretching my legs clumsily, and feeling my way in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness, to the little table where the siphon</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, while Ogilvy exclaimed at the streamer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas that came out towards us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night another invisible missile started on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the earth from Mars, just a second or so</seg><seg type="columnLine">under twenty-four hours after the first one. I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member how I sat on the table there in the black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, with patches of green and crimson swimming</seg><seg type="columnLine">before my eyes. I wished I had a light to smoke by,</seg><seg type="columnLine">little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had seen, and all that it would presently bring me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ogilvy watched till one, and then gave it up. and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we lit the lantern and walked over to his house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down below in the darkness were Ottershaw and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chertsey, and all their hundreds of people, sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">in peace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was full of speculation that night about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition of Mars, and scoffed at the vulgar idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its having inhabitants who were signalling us. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea was that meteorites might be falling in a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">shower upon the planet, or that a huge volcanic ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosion was in progress. He pointed out to me how</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlikely it was that organic evolution had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same direction in the two adjacent planets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The chances against anything man like on Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">are a million to one," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the night after, about midnight, and again the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night after, and so for ten nights, a flame each</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth has attempted to explain. It may be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gases of the firing caused the Martians inconven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ience. Dense clouds of smoke or dust, visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a powerful telescope on earth as little gray,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluctuating patches, spread through the clearness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planet's atmosphere, and obscured its more</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even the daily papers woke up to the disturb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ances at last, and popular notes appeared here, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and everywhere concerning the volcanoes upon Mars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The serio-comic periodical Punch, I remember, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a happy use of it in the political cartoon. And, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsuspected, those missiles the Martians had fired</seg><seg type="columnLine">at us drew earthward, rushing now at a pace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WAR OF THE WORLDS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">425</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">many miles a second through the empty gulf of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, hour by hour and day by day, nearer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer. It seems to me now almost incredibly won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful that, with that swift fate hanging over us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">men could go about their petty concerns as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did. 1 remember how jubilant Markham was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">securing a new photograph of the planet for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">illustrated paper he edited in those days. People</seg><seg type="columnLine">in these latter times scarcely realize the abundance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and enterprise of our nineteenth-century papers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For my own part, I was much occupied in learning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ride the bicycle, and busy upon a series of papers</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussing the. probable developments of moral ideas</seg><seg type="columnLine">as civilization progressed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One night (the first missile then could scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been 10,000,000 miles away) I went for a walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my wife. It was starlight, and I explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Signs of the Zodiac to her, and pointed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars, a bright dot of light creeping zenithward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards which so many telescopes were pointed. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a warm night. Coming home, a party of excur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed us sing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and playing music. There were lights in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper windows of the houses as the people went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed. From the railway station in the distance came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">softened almost into melody by the distance. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red,</seg><seg type="columnLine">green and yellow signal lights, hanging in a frame</seg><seg type="columnLine">work against the sky. It seemed so safe and tran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Falling Star</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN came the night of the first falling star.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was seen early in the morning rushing over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winchester eastward, a line of flame, high in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atmosphere. Hundreds must have seen it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken it for an ordinary falling star. Albin de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribed it as leaving a greenish streak behind it</seg><seg type="columnLine">that glowed for some seconds. Denning, our great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est authority on meteorites, stated that the height</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its first appearance was about ninety or one hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred miles. It seemed to him that it fell to earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">about one hundred miles east of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was at home at that hour and writing in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">Study, and although my French windows face to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">in those days to look up at the night sky), I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of it. Yet this strangest of all things that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever-came to earth from outer space must have fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">while T was sitting there, visible to me had I only</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up as it passed. Some of those who saw its</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight say it travelled with a hissing sound. I my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self heard nothing of that.

Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall of it, and, at most, have thought that another</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteorite had descended. No one seems to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled to look for the fallen mass that night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rut very early in the morning poor Ogilvy, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen the shooting star, and who was persuaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a meteorite lay somewhere on the common be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween Horsell, Ottershaw and Woking, rose early</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the idea of finding it. Find it he did, soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">after dawn, and not far from the sand-pits. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous hole had been made by the impact of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectile, and the sand and gravel had been flung</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">violently in every direction over the heath and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heather, forming heaps visible a mile and a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. The heather was on fire eastward, and a thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue smoke rose against the dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand, amidst the scattered splinters of a fir-tree it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shivered to fragments in its descent. The un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">caked over, and its outline softened by a thick, scaly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dun-colored incrustation. It had a diameter of about</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty yards. He approached the mass, surprised at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the size and more so at the shape, since most mete-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orites are rounded more or less completely. It was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, still so hot from its flight through the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to forbid his near approach. A stirring noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">within its cylinder he ascribed to the unequal cool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of its surface; for at that time it had not oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred to him that it might be hollow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He remained standing at the edge of the pit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing had made for itself, staring at its strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance, astonished chiefly at its unusual shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">and color, and dimly perceiving even then some evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dences of design in its arrival. The early morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wonderfully still, and the sun, just clearing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pine-trees towards Weybridge, was already warm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not remember hearing any birds that morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, there was certainly no breeze stirring, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only sounds were the faint movements from within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cindery cylinder. He was all alone on the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly he noticed with a start that some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gray clinker, the ashy incrustation that cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the meteorite, was falling off the circular edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the end. It was dropping off in flakes and rain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down upon the sand. A large piece suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">came off and fell with a sharp noise that brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heart into his mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a minute he scarcely realized what this</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant, and. although the heat was excessive, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">clambered down into the pit close to the bulk to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the thing more clearly. He fancied even then</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the cooling of the body might account for this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but what disturbed that idea was the fact that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ash was falling only from the end of the cylinder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then he perceived that, very slowly, the cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cular top of the cylinder was rotating on its body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It. was such a gradual movement that he discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">it only through noticing that a black mark that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been near him five minutes ago was now at the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the circumference. Even then he scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood what this indicated, until he heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward an inch or so. Then the thing came upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in a flash. The cylinder was artificial--hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">--with an end that screwed out! Something within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinder was unscrewing the top!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good heavens!" said Ogilvy. "There's a man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">it--men in it! Half roasted to death! Trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At once, with a quick mental leap, he linked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing with a flash upon Mars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE thought of the confined creature was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreadful to him that he forgot the heat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went forward to the cylinder to help turn. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">luckily the dull radiation arrested him before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could burn his hands on the still glowing metal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">426</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">At that he stood irresolute for a moment, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned, scrambled out of the pit, and set off running</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly into Woking. The time then must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere about six o'clock. He met a waggoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tried to make him understand, but the tale he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told, and his appearance, were so wild--his hat had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen off in the pit--that the man simply drove on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was equally unsuccessful with the potman who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just unlocking the doors of the public-house by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horsell Bridge. The fellow thought he was a luna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic at large, and made an unsuccessful attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut him into the tap-room. That sobered him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little, and when he saw Henderson, the London</seg><seg type="columnLine">journalist, in his garden, he called over the palings</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made himself understood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Henderson," he called, "you saw that shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">star last night?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" said Henderson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's out on Horshell Common now.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord!" said Henderson. "Fallen mete-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orite 1 That's good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it's something more than a meteorite. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cylinder--an artificial cylinder, man! And there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">something inside."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Henderson stood up with his spade in his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's that?" he said. He is deaf in one ear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ogilvy told him all that he had seen. Henderson</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a minute or so taking it in. Then he dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his spade, snatched at his jacket, and came out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road. The two men hurried back at once to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">common, and found the cylinder still lying in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same position. But now the sounds inside had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased, and a thin circle of bright metal showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the top and the body of the cylinder. Air</seg><seg type="columnLine">was either entering or escaping at the rim with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin, sizzling sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They listened, rapped on the scale with a stick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, meeting with no response, they both concluded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man or men inside must be insensible or dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course the two were quite unable to do any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. They shouted consolation and promises, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went off back to the town again to get help. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">can imagine them, covered with sand, excited and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disordered, running up the little street in the bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight, just as the shop folks were taking down</seg><seg type="columnLine">their shutters and people were opening their bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room windows. Henderson went into the railway</seg><seg type="columnLine">station at once, in order to telegraph the news to</seg><seg type="columnLine">London. The newspaper articles had prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">men's minds for the reception of the idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By eight o'clock a number of boys and unem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ployed men had already started for the common to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the "dead men from Mars." That was the form</seg><seg type="columnLine">the story took. I heard of it first from my news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper boy, about a quarter to nine, when I went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get my Daily Chronicle. I was naturally startled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lost no time in going out and across the Otter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaw bridge to the sand-pits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg><seg type="columnLine">On Horsell Common</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I FOUND a little crowd of perhaps twenty people</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounding the huge hole in which the cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der lay. I have already described the appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of that colossal bulk, imbedded in the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The turf and gravel about it seemed charred as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a sudden explosion. No doubt its impact had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">caused a flash of fire. Henderson and Ogilvy were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not there. I think they perceived that nothing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be done for the present, and had gone away to</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast at Henderson's house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were four or five boys sitting on the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pit, with their feet dangling, and amusing</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves--until I stopped them--by throwing</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones at the giant mass. After I had spoken to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them about it, they began playing at "touch" in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the group of bystanders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Among these were a couple of cyclists, a jobbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">gardener I employed sometimes, a girl carrying a</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby, Gregg the butcher and his little boy, and two</seg><seg type="columnLine">or three loafers and golf caddies who were accus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomed to hang about the railway station. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very little talking. Few of the common people</seg><seg type="columnLine">in England had anything but the vaguest astronom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical ideas in those days. Most of them were staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly at the big table-like end of the cylinder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was still as Ogilvy and Henderson had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. I fancy the popular expectation of a heap of</seg><seg type="columnLine">charred corpses was disappointed at this inanimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulk. Some went away while I was there, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other people came. I clambered into the pit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancied I heard a faint movement under my feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The top had certainly ceased to rotate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was only when I got thus close to it that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangeness of this object was at all evident to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the first glance it was really no more exciting</seg><seg type="columnLine">than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road. Not so much so, indeed. It looked like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rusty gas-float half buried, more than anything else</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the world. It required a certain amount of scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific education to perceive that the gray scale of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing was no common oxide, that the yellowish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">white metal that gleamed in the crack between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lid and the cylinder had an unfamiliar hue. "Extra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrestrial" had no meaning for most of the on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that time it was quite clear in my own mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Thing had come from the planet Mars, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I judged it improbable that it contained any living</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature. I thought the unscrewing might be auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic. In spite of Ogilvy, I still believed that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were men in Mars. My mind ran fancifully on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibilities of its containing manuscript, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulties in translation that might arise, whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">we should find coins and models in it, and so forth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet it was a little too large for assurance on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea. I felt an impatience to see it opened. About</seg><seg type="columnLine">eleven, as nothing seemed happening, I walked back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of such thoughts, to my home in Maybury. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found it difficult to get to work upon my abstract</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the afternoon the appearance of the common</seg><seg type="columnLine">had altered very much. The early editions of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening papers had startled London with enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">headlines:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"A MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM MARS,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Remarkable Story from Woking,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and so forth. In addition, Ogilvy's wire to the As-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tronomical Exchange had roused every observatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the three kingdoms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were half a dozen cabs or more from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woking station standing in the road by the sand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pits, a basket chaise from Chobham, and a rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WAR OF THE WORLDS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">427</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lordly carriage. Besides that, there was quite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heap of bicycles. In addition, a large number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">people must have walked, in spite of the heat of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, from Woking and Chertsey, so that there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether quite a considerable crowd--one or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaily dressed ladies among the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was glaringly hot, not a cloud in the sky, nor a</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath of wind, and the only shadow was that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the few scattered pine-trees. The burning heather</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been extinguished, but the level ground towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ottershaw was blackened as far as one could see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and still giving off vertical streamers of smoke. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">enterprising sweetstuff dealer in the Chobham Road</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sent up his son with a barrow-load of green</seg><seg type="columnLine">apples and ginger-beer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Going to the edge of the pit, I found it occupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a group of about half a dozen men--Henderson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ogilvy, and a tall fair-haired man that I afterwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned was Stent, the Astronomer Royal, with sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral workmen wielding spades and pickaxes. Stent</seg><seg type="columnLine">was giving directions in a clear, high-pitched voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was standing on the cylinder, which was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently much cooler; his face was crimson and</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaming with perspiration, and something seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have irritated him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A large portion of the cylinder had been uncover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, though its lower end was still embedded. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as Ogilvy saw me among the staring crowd on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the pit, he called to me to come down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and asked me if I would mind going over to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord Hilton, the lord of the manor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The growing crowd, he said, was becoming a</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious impediment to their excavations, especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boys. They wanted a light railing put up, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">help to keep the people back. He told me that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint stirring was occasionally still audible within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case, but that the workmen had failed to un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">screw the top, as it afforded no grip to them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">case appeared to be enormously thick, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible that the faint sounds we heard represented</seg><seg type="columnLine">a noisy tumult in the interior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I was very glad to do as he asked, and so become</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the privileged spectators within the contem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plated enclosure. I failed to find Lord Hilton at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, but I was told he was expected from London</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the six o'clock train from Waterloo; and as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was then about a quarter past five, I went home,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had some tea, and walked up to the station to way-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Cylinder Unscrews</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN I returned to the common the sun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting. Scattered groups were hurrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the direction of Woking, and one or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two persons were returning. The crowd about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit had increased, and stood out black against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lemon-yellow of the sky--a couple of hundred people</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps. There were a number of voices raised,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and some sort of struggle appeared to be going on</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the pit. Strange imaginings passed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind. As I drew nearer I heard Stent's voice:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Keep back! Keep back!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A boy came running towards me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a movin'," he said to me as he passed--"a-</seg><seg type="columnLine">screwin' and a-screwin' out. I don't like it. I'm a-</seg><seg type="columnLine">goin' 'ome, I am."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went on to the crowd. There were really, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should think, two or three hundred people elbowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and jostling one another, the one or two ladies there</seg><seg type="columnLine">being by no means the least active.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's fallen in the pit!" cried someone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep back!" said several.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowd swayed a little, and I elbowed my way</seg><seg type="columnLine">through. Everyone seemed greatly excited. I heai-d</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peculiar humming sound from the pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I say!" said Ogilvy, "help keep those idiots back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We don't know what's in the confounded thing, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw a young man, a shop assistant in Woking</seg><seg type="columnLine">I believe he was, standing on the cylinder and trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to scramble out of the hole again. The crowd had</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed him in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The end of the cylinder was being screwed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from within. Nearly two feet of shining screw pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected. Somebody blundered against me, and I nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowly missed being pitched on to the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screw. I turned, and as I did so the screw must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have come out, and the lid of the cylinder fell upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gravel with a ringing concussion. I stuck my</seg><seg type="columnLine">elbow into the person behind me, and turned my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head towards the Thing again. For a moment that</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular cavity seemed perfectly black. I had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunset in my eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I think everyone expected to see a man emerge--</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly something a little unlike us terrestrial men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in all essentials a man. I know I did. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking, I presently saw something stirring within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadow--grayish billowy movements, one above</seg><seg type="columnLine">another, and then two luminous discs like eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then something resembling a little snake, about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thickness of a walking-stick, coiled up out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the writhing middle, and wriggled in the air to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards me--and then another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden chill came over me. There was a loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">shriek from a woman behind. I half turned, keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which other tentacles were now projecting, and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan pushing my way back from the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit. I saw astonishment giving place to horror on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faces of the people about me. I heard inarticu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">late exclamations 011 all sides. There was a gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral movement backward. I saw the shopman</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling still on the edge of the pit. I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself alone, and saw the people on the other side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pit running off, Stent among them. I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">again at the cylinder, and ungovernable terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped me. I stood petrified and staring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A big grayish, rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bear, was rising slowly and painfully out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder. As it bulged up and caught the light, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">glistened like wet leather. Two large dark-colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were regarding me steadfastly. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded, and had, one might say, a face. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a mouth under the eyes, the lipless brim of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which quivered and panted, and dropped saliva.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The body heaved and pulsated convulsively. A lank</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentacular appendage gripped the edge of the cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, another swayed in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those who have never seen a living Martian can</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely imagine the strange horror of their ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance. The peculiar V-shaped mouth with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed upper lip, the absence of brow ridges, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">absence of a chin beneath, the wedge-like lower lip,</seg><seg type="columnLine">428</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the incessant quivering of this mouth, the Gorgon</seg><seg type="columnLine">groups of tentacles, the tumultuous breathing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lungs in a strange atmosphere, the evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaviness and painfulness of movement, due to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater gravitational energy of the earth--above</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">--culminated in an effect akin to nausea. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something fungoid in the oily brown skin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">something in the clumsy deliberation of their tedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous movements unspeakably terrible. Even at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">first encounter, this first glimpse, I was overcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">with disgust and dread.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SUDDENLY the monster vanished. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">toppled over the brim of the cylinder and fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the pit, with a thud like the fall of a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of leather. I heard it give a peculiar thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry, and forthwith another of these creatures ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared darkly in the deep shadow of the aperture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that my rigour of terror passed away. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and, running madly, made for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of trees, perhaps a hundred yards away;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I ran slantingly and stumbling, for I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">avert my face from these things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There, among some young pine-trees and furze</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes, I stopped, panting, and waited further de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velopments. The common round the sand-pits was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dotted with people, standing, like myself, in a half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinated terror, staring at these creatures, or,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather, at the heaped gravel at the edge of the pit</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which they lay. And then with a renewed hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror, I saw a round, black object bobbing up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on the edge of the pit. It was the head of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shopman who had fallen in, but showing as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little black object against the hot western sky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now he got his shoulder and knee up, and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">he seemed to slip back until only his head was</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible. Suddenly he vanished, and I could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancied a faint shriek had reached me. I had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentary impulse to go back and help him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my fears overruled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything was then quite invisible, hidden by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deep pit and the heap of sand that the fall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinder had made. Anyone coming along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road from Chobham or Woking would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazed at the sight--a dwindling multitude of per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps a hundred people or more standing in a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">irregular circle, in ditches, behind bushes, behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">gates and hedges, saying little to one another, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in short, excited shouts, and staring, staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard at a few heaps of sand. The barrow of gin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger-beer stood, a queer derelict, black against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning sky, and in the sand-pits was a row of</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted vehicles with their horses feeding out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose-bags or pawing the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Heat-Ray</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER the glimpse I had had of the Martians</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerging from the cylinder in which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to the earth from their planet, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of fascination paralyzed my actions. I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained standing knee-deep in the heather, staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the mound that hid them. I was a battle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground of fear and curiosity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not dare to go back toward the pit, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a passionate longing to peer into it. I began</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">walking, therefore, in a big curve, seeking some</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of vantage, and continually looking at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand-heaps that hid these new-comers to our earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once a leash of thin black whips, like the arms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an octopus, flashed across the sunset and was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately withdrawn, and afterwards a thin rod</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose up, joint by joint, bearing at its apex a circu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar disc that spun with a wobbling motion. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be going on there?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Most of the spectators had gathered in one or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two groups--one a little crowd towards Woking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other a knot of people in the direction of Chob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham. Evidently they shared my mental conflict.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were few near me. One man I approached--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was, I perceived, a neighbour of mine, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not know his name--and accosted. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was scarcely a time for articulate conversation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What ugly brutes!" he said. "Good God! what</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly brutes!" He repeated this over and oyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you see a man in the pit?" I said; but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made me no answer to that. We became silent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stood watching for a time side by side, deriv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, I fancy, a certain comfort in one another's</seg><seg type="columnLine">company. Then I shifted my position to a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">knoll that gave me the advantage of a yard or more</seg><seg type="columnLine">of elevation, and when I looked for him presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was walking towards Woking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sunset faded to twilight before anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">further happened. The crowd far away on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">now a faint murmur from it. The little knot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">people towards Chobham dispersed. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was this, as much as anything, that gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">people courage, and I suppose the new arrivals</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Woking also helped to restore confidence. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">any rate, as the dusk came on, a slow intermittent</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement upon the sand-pits began, a movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening about the cylinder remained unbroken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vertical black figures in twos and threes would ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vance, stop, watch, and advance again, spreading</seg><seg type="columnLine">out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">boldly into the sand-pits, and heard the clatter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoofs and the grind of wheels. I saw a lad trund-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling off the barrow of apples. And then, within</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty yards of the pit, advancing from the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of Horsell I noted a little black knot of men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was the Deputation. There had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasty consultation, and, since the Martians were</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently, in spite of their repulsive forms, intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gent creatures, it had been resolved to show them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by approaching them with signals, that we, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were intelligent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Flutter, flutter, went the flag, first to the right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then to the left. It was too far for me to recogr</seg><seg type="columnLine">nize anyone there, but afterwards I learned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ogilvy, Stent, and Henderson were with others in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this attempt at communication. This little group</seg><seg type="columnLine">had in its advance dragged inward, so to speak, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumference of the now almost complete circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WAR OF THE WORLDS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">429</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of people, and a number of dim black figures fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed it at discreet distances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly there was a flash of light, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantity of luminous greenish smoke came out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pit in three distinct puffs, which drove up, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the other, straight into the still air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">better word for it) was so bright that the deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue sky overhead, and the hazy stretches of brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">common towards Chertsey, set with black pine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, seemed to darken abruptly as these puffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose, and to remain the darker after their dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">persal. At the same time a faint hissing sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">became audible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND the pit stood the little wedge of people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the white flag at its apex, arrested by</seg><seg type="columnLine">these phenomena, a little knot of small vertical</seg><seg type="columnLine">black shapes upon the black ground. As the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke rose, their faces flashed out pallid green,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and faded again as it vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then slowly the hissing passed into a humming,</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a long, loud, droning noise. Slowly a humped</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape rose out of the pit, and the ghost of a beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light seemed to flicker out from it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Forthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaping from one to another, sprang from the scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered group of men. It was as if some invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">jet impinged upon them and flashed into white</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame. It was as if each man were suddenly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentarily turned to fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, by the light of their own destruction, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw them staggering and falling, and their sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porters turning to run.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stood staring, not as yet realizing that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was death leaping from man to man in that little</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant crowd. All I felt was that it was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing strange. An almost noiseless and blinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash of light, and a man fell headlong and lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">still, and as the unseen shaft of heat passed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, pine-trees burst into fire, and every dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">furze-bush became with one dull thud a mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames. And far away towards Knaphill I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings suddenly set alight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was sweeping round swiftly and steadily, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming death, this invisible, inevitable sword of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat. I perceived it coming towards me by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing bushes it touched, and was too astounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">arid stupefied to stir. I heard the crackle of fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">in tho sand-pits and the sudden squeal of a horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was as suddenly stilled. Then it was as if an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Invisible yet intensely heated finger was drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the heather between me and the Martians,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all along a curving line beyond the sand pits</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark ground smoked and crackled. Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell with a crash, far away to the left where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road from Wokfng Station opens out on the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon. Forthwith the hissing and humming ceased,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the black, dome-like object sank slowly out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sight into the pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this had happened with such swiftness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had stood motionless, dumfounded and dazzled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flashes of light. Had that death swept through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a full circle, it must inevitably have slain me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my surprise. But it passed and spared me, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">left the night about me suddenly dark and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The undulating common seemed now dark almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">to blackness, except where its roadways lay gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pale under the deep-blue sky of the early night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was dark, and suddenly void of men. Overhead</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stars were mustering, and in the west the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still a pale, bright, almost greenish blue. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tops of the pine-trees and the roofs of Horsell</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out sharp and black against the western after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow. The Martians and their appliances were al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">together invisible, save for that thin mast upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which their restless mirror wobbled. Patches of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush and isolated trees here and there smoked</seg><seg type="columnLine">and glowed still, and the houses towards Woking</seg><seg type="columnLine">Station were sending up spires of flame into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stillness of the evening air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing was changed save for that and a terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishment. The little group of black specks</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the flag of white had been swept out of exis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tence, and the stillness of the evening, so it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me, had scarcely been broken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came to me that I was upon this dark com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon, helpless, unprotected and alone. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a thing falling upon me from without came--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With an effort I turned and began a stumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">run through the heather.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fear I felt was no rational fear but a panic</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror, not only of the Martians, but of the dusk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stillness all about me. Such an extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect in unmanning me it had that I ran weeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently as a child might do. Once I had turned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not dare to look back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I remember I felt an extraordinary persuasion</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was being played with, that presently, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was upon the very verge of safety, this mysteri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous death--as swift as the passage of light--would</seg><seg type="columnLine">leap after me from the pit about the cylinder, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike me down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Ileat-Ray in the Chobham Road</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT is still a matter of wonder how the Martians</seg><seg type="columnLine">are able to slay men so swiftly and so silently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many think that in some way they are able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolute non-conductivity. This intense heat they</seg><seg type="columnLine">project in a parallel beam against any object they</seg><seg type="columnLine">choose by means of a polished parabolic mirror</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unknown composition--much as the parabolic</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror of a lighthouse projects a beam of light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But no one has absolutely proved these details.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However it is done, it is certain that a beam of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat is the essence of the matter. Heat, and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible, instead of visible light. Whatever is com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bustible flashes into flame at its touch, lead runs</seg><seg type="columnLine">like water, it softens iron, cracks and melts glass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when it falls upon water incontinently that ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plodes into steam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night nearly forty people lay under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">starlight about the pit, charred and distorted be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond recognition, and all night long the common</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Horsell to Maybury was deserted, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly ablaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The news of the massacre probably reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chobham, Woking, and Ottershaw about the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">430</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">time. In Woking the shops had closed when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragedy happened, and a number of people, shop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">people and so forth, attracted by the stories they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard, were walking over Horsell Bridge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the road between the hedges that run out at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last upon the common. You may imagine the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young people brushed up after the labors of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, and making this novelty, as they would make</seg><seg type="columnLine">any novelty, the excuse for walking together and</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoying a trivial flirtation. You may figure to</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself the hum of voices along the road in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloaming. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As yet, of course, few people in Woking even</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that the cylinder had opened, though poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson had sent a messenger on a bicycle to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the post-office with a special wire to an evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As these folks came out by twos and threes upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open they found little knots of people talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitedly, and peering at the spinning mirror over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sand-pits, and the new-comers were, no doubt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boon infected by the excitement of the occasion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By half-past eight, when the Deputation was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed, there may have been a crowd of 300 people</seg><seg type="columnLine">or more at this place, besides those who had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road to approach the Martians nearer. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were three policemen, too, one of whom was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted, doing their best, under instructions from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stent, to keep the people back and deter them from</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching the cylinder. There was some booing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from those more thoughtless and excitable souls to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom a crowd is always an occasion for noise and</seg><seg type="columnLine">horseplay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stent and Ogilvy, anticipating some possibilities</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a collision, had telegraphed from Horsell to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barracks as soon as the Martians emerged, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">help of a company of soldiers to protect these</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange creatures from violence. After that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to lead that ill-fated advance. The de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scription of their death, as it was seen by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd, tallies very closely with my own impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions: the three puffs of green smoke, the deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">humming note, and the flashes of flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that crowd of people had a far narrower</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape than mine. Only the fact that a hummock</seg><seg type="columnLine">of heathery sand intercepted the lower part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heat-Ray saved them. Had the elevation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parabolic mirror been a few yards higher, none</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have lived to tell the tale. They saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashes, and the men falling, and an invisible hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it were, lit the bushes as it hurried towards them</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the twilight. Then, with a whistling note</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rose above the droning of the pit, the beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung close over their heads, lighting the tops of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beech-trees that line the road, and splitting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bricks, smashing the windows, firing the window-</seg><seg type="columnLine">frames, and bringing down in crumbling ruin a</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion of the gable of the house nearest the corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the sudden thud, hiss and glare of the igniting</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, the panic-stricken crowd seems to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed hesitatingly for some moments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sparks and burning twigs began to fall into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road, and single leaves like puffs of flame. Hats</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dresses caught fire. Then came a crying from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the common.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were shrieks and shouts, and suddenly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted policeman came galloping through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion with his hands clasped over his head,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're coming!" a woman shrieked, and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">continently everyone was turning and pushing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">those behind, in order to clear their way to Woking</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. They must have bolted as blindly as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flock of sheep. Where the road grows narrow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">black between the high banks the crowd jammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a desperate struggle occurred. All that crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not escape; three persons at least, two women</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a little boy, were crushed and trampled there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left to die amidst the terror and the darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg><seg type="columnLine">How I Reached Home</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR my own part, I remember nothing of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight except the stress of blundering against</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees and stumbling through the heather. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">about me gathered the invisible terrors of the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians; that pitiless sword of heat seemed whirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">to and fro, flourishing overhead before it descended</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smote me out of life. I came into the road be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the cross-roads and Horsell, and ran along</seg><seg type="columnLine">this to the cross-roads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last I could go no further; I was exhausted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the violence of my emotion and of my flight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I staggered and fell by the wayside. That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the bridge that crosses the canal by the gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">works. I fell and lay still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I must have remained there some time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sat up, strangely perplexed. For a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, I could not clearly understand how I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. My terror had fallen from me like a gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. My hat had gone, and my collar had burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from its stud. A few minutes before there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had only been three real things before me--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">immensity of the night and space and nature, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own feebleness and anguish, and the near approach</seg><seg type="columnLine">of death. Now it was as if something turned over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the point of view altered abruptly. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sensible transition from one state of mind to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other. I was immediately the self of every</seg><seg type="columnLine">day again, a decent ordinary citizen. The silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">common, the impulse of my flight, the starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames, were as if it were a dream. I asked myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">had these latter things indeed happened. I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not credit it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bridge. My mind was blank wonder. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles and nerves seemed drained of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength. I dare say I staggered drunkenly. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">head rose over the arch, and the figure of a work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man carrying a basket appeared. Beside him ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little boy.

A dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of people talked in the gate of one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses in the pretty little row of gables that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Oriental Terrace.

On the surface of the earth the force of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity is three times what it is on the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mars. A Martian, therefore, would weigh three</seg><seg type="columnLine">times more than on Mars, albeit his muscular</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength would be the same. His own body would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a cope of lead to him, therefore. That indeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the general opinion. Both the Times and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daily Telegraph, for instance, insisted on it the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">next morning, and both overlooked, just as I did,</seg><seg type="columnLine">two obvious modifying influences.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The atmosphere of the earth, we now know, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains far more oxygen or far less nitrogen (which-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever way one likes to put it) than does Mars. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">invigorating influences of this excess of oxygen</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the Martians indisputably did much to count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erbalance the increased weight of their bodies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, in the second place, we all overlooked the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that such mechanical intelligence as the Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed was quite able to dispense with muscu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar exertion at a pinch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I did not consider these points at the time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so my reasoning was dead against the chances</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the invaders.

All over the district people were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dining and supping; working-men were gardening</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the labors of the day, children' were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">put to bed, young people were wandering through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lanes love-making, students sat over their books.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maybe there was a murmur in the village streets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a novel and dominant topic in the public-houses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and here and there a messenger, or even an eye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">witness of the later occurrences, caused a whirl of</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement, a shouting and a running to and fro;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but for the most part the daily routine of working,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating, drinking, sleeping, went 011 as it had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">for countless years-- as though no planet Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">existed in the sky. Even at Woking Station and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horsell and Chobham that was the case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In Woking Junction, until a late hour, trains</seg><seg type="columnLine">were stopping and going on, others were shunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the sidings, passengers were alighting and wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and everything was proceeding in the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary way. A boy from town, trenching on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith's monopoly, was selling papers with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon's news. The ringing and impact of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trucks, the sharp whistle of the engines from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">junction, mingled with his shouts of "Men from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars!" Excited men came into the station about</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine o'clock, with incredible tidings, and caused no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more disturbance than drunkards might have done.</seg><seg type="columnLine">People rattling Londonwards peered into the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness outside the carriage windows and saw only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rare, flickering, vanishing spark dance up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction of Horsell, a red glow and a thin veil</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smoke driving across the stars, and thought that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing more serious than a heath fire was hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pening. It was only around the edge of the common</seg><seg type="columnLine">that any disturbance was perceptible. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a dozen villas burning on the Woking border.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were lights in all the houses on the common</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the three villages, and the people there kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">awake till dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A curious crowd lingered restlessly, people com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and going but the crowd remaining, both on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Chobham and Horsell bridges. One or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventurous souls, it was afterwards found, went</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the darkness and crawled quite near the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians, but they never returned, for now and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">a light-ray, like the beam of a warship's search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, swept the common, and the Heat-Ray was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to follow. Save for such, that big area of</seg><seg type="columnLine">common was silent and desolate, and the charred</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies lay about 011 it all night under the stars, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the next day. A noise of hammering from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit was heard by many people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SO you have the state of things on Friday night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I11	the centre, sticking into the skin of our old</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet Earth like a poisoned dart, was this cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der.

Beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a fringe of excitement, and further than that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fringe the inflammation had not crept as yet. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of the world the stream of life still flowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it had flowed for immemorial years.

Several officers from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inkerman barracks had been 011 the common earlier</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the day, and one, Major Eden, was reported to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be missing. The Colonel of the regiment came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Chobham bridge, and was busy questioning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd at midnight. The military authorities</seg><seg type="columnLine">were certainly alive to the seriousness of tKe busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. About eleven, the next morning's papers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were able to say, a squadron of hussars, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxims, and about 400 men of the Cardigan regi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, started from Aldershot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few seconds after midnight the crowd in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chertsey road, Woking, saw a star fall from heaven</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the pine-woods to the north-west.

I had slept but little, though my</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife had succeeded in sleeping, and I rose early.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I went into my garden before breakfast, and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening, but towards the common there was noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing stirring but a lark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The milkman came as usual. I heard the rattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his chariot, and I went round to the side-gate to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask the latest news. He told me thatgduring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night the Martians had been surrounded by troops,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that guns were expected. Then, a familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">reassuring note, I heard a train running towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They aren't to be killed," said the milkman, "if</seg><seg type="columnLine">that can possibly be avoided."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw my neighbor gardening, chatted with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a time, and then strolled in to breakfast. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a most unexceptional morning. My neighbor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was of opinion that the troops would be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">capture or to destroy the Martians during the day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a pity they make themselves so unapproach- *</seg><seg type="columnLine">able," he said.

Under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railway-bridge I found a group of soldiers--sap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers, I think, men in small round caps, dirty red</seg><seg type="columnLine">jackets unbuttoned, and showing their blue shirts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark trousers, and boots coming to the calf. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me no one was allowed over the canal, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking along the road towards the bridge, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the Cardigan men standing sentinel there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I talked with these soldiers for a time; I told them</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my sight of the Martians on the previous eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning. None of them had seen the Martians, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had but the vaguest ideas of them, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they plied me with questions. They said that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not know who had authorized the movements of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the troops; their idea was that a dispute had arisen</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Horse Guards. The ordinary sapper is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great deal better educated than the common</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldier, and they discussed the peculiar conditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the possible fight with some acuteness. I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribed the Heat-Ray to them, and they began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">argue among themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Crawl up under cover and rush 'em, say I,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get aht!'' said another. "What's Cover against</seg><seg type="columnLine">this 'ere 'eat? Sticks to cook yer! What we got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do is to go as near as the ground'll let us, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then drive a trench."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Blow yer trenches! You always want trenches;</seg><seg type="columnLine">you ought to ha' been born a rabbit.

"You carnt</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell what they might do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's your shells?" said the first speaker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There ain't no time. Do it in a rush, that's my</seg><seg type="columnLine">tip, and do it at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So they discussed it. After a while T left them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went on to the railway-station to get as many</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning papers as I could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I will not weary the reader with a descrip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of that long morning and of the longer after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon. I did not succeed in getting a giimpse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the common, for even Horsell and Chobham church</seg><seg type="columnLine">towers were in the hands of the military authori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties. The soldiers I addressed didn't know any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing; the officers were mysterious as well as busy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I found people in the town quite secure again in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presence of the military, and I heard for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time from Marshall, the tobacconist, that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">son was among the dead on the common. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers had made the people on the outskirts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horsell lock up and leave their houses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I GOT back to lunch about two, very tired, for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I have said, the day was extremely hot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dull, and in order to refresh myself I took a cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">bath in the afternoon. About half-past four I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the railway-station to get an evening paper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the morning papers had contained only a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">inaccurate description of the killing of Stent, Hen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derson, Ogilvy, and the others. But there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">little I didn't know. The Martians did not show</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inch of themselves. They seemed busy in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit, and there was a sound of hammering and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost continuous streamer of smoke. Apparently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were busy getting ready for a struggle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fresh attempts have been made to signal, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">without success," was the stereotyped formula of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the papers. A sapper told me it was done by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians took as much notice of such advances</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we should of the lowing of a cow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I must confess the sight of all this armament,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all this preparation, greatly excited me. My imag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ination became belligerent, and defeated the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaders in a dozen striking ways; something of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my schoolboy dreams of battle and heroism came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. It hardly seemed a fair fight to me at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. They seemed very helpless in this pit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">theirs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About three o'clock there began the thud of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun at measured intervals from Chertsey or Addle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone. I learned that the smouldering pine-wood</seg><seg type="columnLine">into which the second cylinder had fallen was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelled, in the hope of destroying that object before</seg><seg type="columnLine">it opened. It was only about five, however, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a field-gun reached Chobham for use against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first body of Martians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About six in the evening, as I sat at tea with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wife in the summer-house talking vigorously</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the battle that was lowering upon us, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a muffled detonation from the common, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately after a gust of firing. Close on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels of that came a violent, rattling crash, quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to us, that shook the ground; and, starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">out upon the lawn, I saw the tops of the trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the Oriental College burst into smoky red</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame, and the tower of the little church beside it</seg><seg type="columnLine">slide down into ruin. The pinnacle of the mosque</seg><seg type="columnLine">had vanished, and the roof-line of the college itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked as if a hundred-ton gun had been at work</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it. One of our chimneys cracked as if a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot had hit it, flew, and the piece of it came clat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering down the tiles and made a heap of broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">red fragments upon the flower-bed by my study</seg><seg type="columnLine">window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I and my wife stood amazed. Then I realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the crest of Maybury Hill must be within</seg><seg type="columnLine">range of the Martians' Heat-Ray now that the col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lege was cleared out of the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that I gripped my wife's arm. and without</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceremony ran her out into the road. Then I fetched</seg><seg type="columnLine">434</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">out the servant, telling her I would go upstairB</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself for the box she was clamouring for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can't possibly stay here," I said; and as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke the firing re-opened for a moment upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">common.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But where are we to go?" said my wife in</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought, perplexed. Then I remembered her</seg><seg type="columnLine">cousins at Leatherhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leatherhead!" I shouted above the sudden noise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked away from me downhill. The people</seg><seg type="columnLine">were coming out of their houses astonished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How are we to get to Leatherhead?" she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down the hill I saw a bevy of hussars ride under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the railway-bridge; three galloped through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open gates of the Oriental College; two others dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted, and began running from house to house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sun, shining through the smoke that drove up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the tops of the trees, seemed blood-red, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop here," said I; "you are safe here;" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I started off at once for the Spotted Dog, for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the landlord had a horse and dogcart. I ran,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I perceived that in a moment everyone upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">this side of the hill would be moving. I found him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his bar, quite unaware of what was going on</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind his house. A man stood with his back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, talking to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must have a pound," said the landlord, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've no one to drive it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll give you two," said I, over the stranger's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I'll bring it back by midnight," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lord!" said the landlord, "what's the hurry?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm selling my bit of a pig. Two pounds, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring it back? What's going on now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I explained hastily that I had to leave my home,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so secured the dogcart. At the time it did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to me nearly so urgent that the landlord</seg><seg type="columnLine">should leave his. I took care to have the cart there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then, drove it off down the road, and, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in charge of my wife and servant, rushed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my house and packed a few valuables, such plate</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we had, and so forth. The beech-trees below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house were burning while I did this, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palings up the road glowed red. While I was oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupied in this way, one of the dismounted hussars</seg><seg type="columnLine">came running up. He was going from house to</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, warning people to leave. He was going on</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I came out of my front door, lugging my treas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures, done up in a table-cloth. I shouted after</seg><seg type="columnLine">him:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What news?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned, stared, bawled something about</seg><seg type="columnLine">"crawling out in a thing like a dish cover," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran on to the gate of the house at the crest. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden whirl of black smoke driving across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road hid him for a moment. I ran to my neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bor's door, and rapped to satisfy myself, what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">already knew, that his wife had gone to London</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him, and had locked up their house. I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">in again according to my promise to get my</seg><seg type="columnLine">servant's box, lugged it out, clapped it beside her</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the tail of the dogcart, and then caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reins and jumped up into the driver's seat beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wife. In another moment we were clear of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the smoke and noise, and spanking down the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite slope at Maybury Hill towards Old Woking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In front was a quiet sunny landscape, a wheat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field ahead on either side of the road, and the May-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bury Inn with its swinging sign. I saw the doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor's cart ahead of me. At the bottom of the hill</seg><seg type="columnLine">I turned my head to look at the hillside I was leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Thick streamers of black smoke shot with</seg><seg type="columnLine">threads of red fire were driving up into the still</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, and throwing dark shadows upon the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree-tops eastward. The smoke already extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">far away to the east and west--to the Byfleet pine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods eastward, and to Woking on the west. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">road was dotted with people running towards us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And very faint now, but very distinct through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot, quiet air, one heard the whirr of a machine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun that was presently stilled, and an intermittent</seg><seg type="columnLine">crackling of rifles. Apparently, the Martians were</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting fire to everything within range of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heat-Ray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am not an expert driver, and I had immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">to turn ray attention to the horse. When I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back again the second hill had hidden the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke. I slashed the horse with the whip, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him a loose rein until Woking and Send lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">between us and that quivering tumult. I overtook</seg><seg type="columnLine">and passed the doctor between Woking and Send.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           CHAPTER X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           In the Storm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LEATHERHEAD is about twelve miles from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybury Hill. The scent of hay was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air through the lush meadows beyond Pyr-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford, and the hedges on either side were sweet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gay with multitudes of dog-roses. The heavy firing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had broken out while we were driving down</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybury Hill ceased as abruptly as it began, leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the evening very peaceful and still. We got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Leatherhead without misadventure about nine</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock, and the horse had an hour's rest while I</seg><seg type="columnLine">took supper with my cousins and commended my</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife to their care.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My wife was curiously silent throughout the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive, and seemed oppressed with forebodings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil.

Something very like the war-fever, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasionally runs through a civilized community,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had got into my blood, and in my heart I was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">so very sorry that I had to return to Maybury that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. I was even afraid that last fusillade I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard might mean the extermination of our in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaders from Mars.

Happily, I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road intimately. My wife stood in the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the doorway, and watched me until I jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">up into the dogcart. Then abruptly she turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went in, leaving my cousins side by side wish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me good hap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was a little depressed at first with the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tagion of my wife's fears, but very soon my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts reverted to the Martians. At that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was absolutely in the dark as to the course of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening's fighting. I did not know even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances that had precipitated the conflict.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I came through Ockham (for that was the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">I returned, and not through Send and Old Wok-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing) I saw along the western horizon a blood-red</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow, which, as I drew nearer, crept slowly up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. The driving clouds of the gathering thunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm mingled there with masses of black and red</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ripley Street was deserted, and except for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted window or so the village showed not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of life; but I narrowly escaped an accident</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the corner of the road to Pyrford, where a knot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of people stood with their backs to me. They said</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to me as T passed. I do not know what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew of the things happening beyond the hill, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">do I know if the silent houses I passed on my way</seg><seg type="columnLine">were sleeping securely, or deserted and empty, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">harassed and watching against the terror of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From Ripley until T came through Pyrford I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the valley of the Wey, and the red glare</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hidden from me. As I ascended the little hill</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond Pyrford Church the glare came into view</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and the trees about me shivered with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first intimation of the storm that was upon me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then T heard midnight pealing out from Pyrford</seg><seg type="columnLine">Church behind me, and then came the silhouette</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Maybury Hill, with its tree-tops and roofs black</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sharp against the red.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as T beheld this a lurid green glare lit</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road about me, and showed the distant woods</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards Addlestone. T felt a tug at the reins.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw that the driving clouds had been pierced as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were by a thread of green fire, suddenly light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their confusion and falling into the fields to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my left. It was the Third Falling Star!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Close on its apparition, and blindingly violet by</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrast, danced out the first lightning of the gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering storm, and the thunder burst like a rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead. The horse took the bit between his teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bolted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moderate incline runs down towards the foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Maybury Hill, and down this we clattered. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lightning had begun, it went on in as rapid a</seg><seg type="columnLine">succession of flashes as I have ever seen. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder-claps, treading one on the heels of another</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with a strange crackling accompaniment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded more like the working of a gigantic elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tric machine than the usual detonating reverbera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. The flickering light was blinding and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusing, and a thin hail smote gustily at my face</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I drove down the slope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT first I regarded little but the road before</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and then abruptly my attention was ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested by something that was moving rapidly down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opposite slope of Maybury Hill. At first I took</seg><seg type="columnLine">it for the wet roof of a house, but one flash fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing another showed it to be in swift rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement. It was an elusive vision--a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewildering darkness, and then in a flash like day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, the red masses of the Orphanage near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crest of the hill, the green tops of the pine-trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this problematical object came out clear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp and bright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And this thing I saw! How can I describe it?</seg><seg type="columnLine">A monstrous tripod, higher than many houses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">striding over the young pine-trees, and smashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">them aside in its career; a walking engine of glit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering metal, striding now across the heather;</seg><seg type="columnLine">articulate ropes of steel dangling from it, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clattering tumult of its passage mingling with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">riot of the thunder. A flash, and it came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">vividly, heeling over one way with two feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air, to vanish and reappear almost instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it seemed, with the next flash, a hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer. Can you imagine a milking-stool tilted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowled violently along the ground? That was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression those instant flashes gave. But instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a milking-stool imagine it a great body of ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chinery on a tripod stand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly the trees in the pine-wood ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of me were parted, as brittle reeds are parted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man thrusting through them; they were snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">off and driven headlong, and a second huge tripod</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, rushing, as it seemed, headlong towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. And I was galloping hard to meet it! At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sight of the second monster my nerve went</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether. Not stopping to look again, I wTenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horse's head hard round to the right, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">another moment the dogcart had heeled over upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horse; the shafts smashed noisily, and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung sideways and fell heavily into a shallow pool</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I crawled out almost immediately, and crouched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my feet still in the water, under a clump of furze.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The horse lay motionless (his neck was broken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor brute!), and by the lightning flashes I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">I he black bulk of the overturned dogcart, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silhouette of the wheel still spinning slowly. In an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other moment the colossal mechanism went strid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing by me, and passed uphill towards Pyrford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seen nearer, the thing was incredibly strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it was no mere insensate machine driving on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Machine it was, with a ringing metallic pace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and long flexible glittering tentacles (one of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped a young pine-tree) swinging and rattling</seg><seg type="columnLine">about its strange body. It picked its road as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">went striding along, and the brazen hood that sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted it moved to and fro with the inevitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion of a head looking about it. Behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main body was a huge thing of white metal like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gigantic fisherman's basket, and puffs of green</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke squirted out from the joints of the limbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the monster swept by me. And in an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So much I saw then, all vaguely for the flicker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the lightning, in blinding high lights and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense black shadows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it passed it set up an exultant deafening</seg><seg type="columnLine">436</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING' STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">howl that drowned the thunder, "Aloo! aloo!" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in another minute it was with its companion, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a mile away, stooping over something in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field. I have no doubt this thing in the field was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the third of the ten cylinders they had fired at us</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Mars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some minutes I lay there in the rain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness watching, by the intermittent light, these</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous beings of metal moving about in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance over the hedge-tops. A thin hail was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now beginning, and as it came and went, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures grew misty and then flashed into clearness</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Now and then came a gap in the lightning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the night swallowed them up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was soaked with hail above and puddle-water</seg><seg type="columnLine">below. It was some time before my blank astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment would let me struggle up the bank to a drier</seg><seg type="columnLine">position, or think at all about my imminent peril.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not far from me was a little one-roomed squat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter's hut of wood, surrounded by a patch of potato-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden. I struggled to my feet at last, and, crouch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and making use of every chance of cover, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a run for this. I hammered at the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I could not make the people hear (if there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were any people inside), and after a time I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted, and, availing myself of a ditch for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater part of the way, succeeded in crawling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unobserved by these monstrous machines, into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pine-wood towards Maybury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under cover of this I pushed on, wet and shiver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing now, towards my own house. I walked among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees trying to find the footpath. It was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark indeed in the wood, for the lightning was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now becoming infrequent, and the hail, which waa</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouring down in a torrent, fell in columns through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gaps in the heavy foliage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If I had fully realized the meaning of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things I had seen I should have immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked my way round through Byfleet to Street</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cobham, and so gone back to rejoin my wife at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leatherhead. But that night the strangeness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things about me, and my physical wretchedness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevented me, for I was bruised, weary, wet to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin, deafened and blinded by the storm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had a vague idea of going to my own house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that was as much motive as I had. I staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the trees, fell into a ditch and bruised</seg><seg type="columnLine">my knees against a plank, and finally splashed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the lane that ran down from the College Arms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I say splashed, for the storm water was sweeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sand down the hill in a muddy torrent. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the darkness a man blundered into me and sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">me reeling back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gave a cry of terror, sprang sideways, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed on before I could gather my wits sufficiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak to him. So heavy was the stress of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm just at this place that I had the hardest</seg><seg type="columnLine">task to win my way up the hill. I went close up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the fence on the left and worked my way along</seg><seg type="columnLine">its palings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Near the top I stumbled upon something soft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, by a flash of lightning, saw between my feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">a heap of black broadcloth and a pair of boots.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before I could distinguish clearly how the man lay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flicker of light had passed. I stood over him</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for the next flash. When it came, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was a sturdy man, cheaply but not shabbily</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed; his head was bent under his oody, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lay crumpled up close tp the fence, as though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been flung violently against it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Overcoming the repugnance natural to one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never before touched a dead body, I stooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned him over to feel for his heart. He w'as</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite dead. Apparently his neck had been broken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lightning flashed for a third time, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face leapt upon me. I sprang to my feet. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landlord of the Spotted Dog, whose conveyance</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had taken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stepped over him gingerly and pushed on up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hill. I made my way by the police-station and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the College Arms towards my own house. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was burning on the hillside, though from the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon there still came a red glare and a rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumult of ruddy smoke beating up against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drenching hail. So far as I could see by the flashes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the houses about me were mostly uninjured. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">the College Arms a dark heap lay in the road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down the road towards Maybury Bridge there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were voices and the sound of feet, but I had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the courage to shout or to go to them. I let my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in with my latchkey, closed, locked and bolted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, staggered to the foot of the staircase and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down. My imagination was full of those strid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing metallic monsters, and of the dead body</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed against the fence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I crouched at the foot of the staircase with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the wall, shivering violently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           CHAPTER XI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           At the Window</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I HAVE said already that my storms of emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion have a trick of exhausting themselves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a time I discovered that I was cold and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet, and with little pools of water about me on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stair-carpet. I got up almost mechanically,</seg><seg type="columnLine">went into the dining-room and drank some whisky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then I was moved to change my clothes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After I had done that I went upstairs to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">study, but why I did so I do not know. The win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow of my study looks over the trees and the rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way towards Horsell Common. In the hurry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our departure this window had been left open.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The passage was dark, and, by contrast with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture the window-frame enclosed, that side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room seemed impenetrably dark. I stopped short</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thunderstorm had passed. The towers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Oriental College and the pine-trees about it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, and very far away, lit by a vivid red glare,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the common about the rand-pits was visible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Across the light, huge black shapes, grotesque and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange, moved busily to and fro.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed, indeed, as if the whole country in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction was on fire--a broad hillside set with</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute tongues of flame, swaying and writhing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the gusts of the dying storm, and throwing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a red reflection upon the cloud scud above. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and then a haze of smoke from some nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">conflagration drove across the window and hid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian shapes. I could not see what they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing, nor the clear form of them, nor recognize</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black objects they were busied upon. Neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">could I see the nearer fire, though the reflections</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WAR OF THE WORLDS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">437</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of it danced on the wall and ceiling of the study. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp, resinous twang of burning was in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I closed the door noiselessly and crept towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window. As I did so, the view opened out</seg><seg type="columnLine">until, on the one hand, it reached to the houses</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Woking Station, and on the other to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">charred and blackened pine-woods of Byfleet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a light down below the hill, on the rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, near the arch, and several of the houses along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Maybury road and the streets near the station</seg><seg type="columnLine">were glowing ruins. The light upon the railway</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled me at first; there was a black heap and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vivid glare, and to the right of that a row of yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low oblongs. Then I perceived this was a wrecked</seg><seg type="columnLine">train, the fore part smashed and on fire, the hinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">carriages still upon the rails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Between these three main centres of light, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses, the train, and the burning country towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chobham, stretched irregular patches of dark coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try, broken here and there by intervals of dimly</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing and smoking ground. It was the strangest</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectacle, that black expanse set with fire. It re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded me, more than anything else, of the Pot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teries seen at night. People at first I could dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinguish none, though I peered intently for them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Later I saw against the light of Woking Station</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of black figures hurrying one after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other across the line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And this was the little world in which I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been- living securely for years, this fiery chaos!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What had happened in the last seven hours I still</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not know, nor did I know, though I was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning to guess, the relation between these me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanical colossuses and the sluggish lumps I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen disgorged from the cylinder. With a queer feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of impersonal interest I turned my desk-chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the window, sat down, and stared at the black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened country, and particularly at the three gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">black things that were going to and fro in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare about the sand-pits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They seemed amazingly busy. I began to ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself what they could be. Were they intelligent</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanisms? Such a thing I felt was impossible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or did a Martian sit within each, ruling, directing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">using, much as a man's brain sits and rules in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body? I began to compare the things to human</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines, to ask myself for the first time in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">life how an ironclad or a steam-engine would seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an intelligent lower animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The storm had left the sky clear, and over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke of the burning land the little fading pin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of Mars was dropping into the west, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soldier came into my garden. I heard a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraping at the fence, and rousing myself from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lethargy that had fallen upon me, I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and saw him dimly, clambering over the pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings. At the sight of another human being my</seg><seg type="columnLine">torpor passed, and I leaned out of the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hist!" said I in a whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped astride of the fence in doubt. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came over and across the lawn to the corner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house. He bent down and stepped softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who's there?" he said, also whispering, stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing under the window and peering up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are you going?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God knows."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you trying to hide in here?" I inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come into the house," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went down, unfastened the door and let him in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and locked the door again. I could not see his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. He was hatless, and his coat was unbuttoned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cctv^tY God!" he said as I drew him in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1V1 "What has happened?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What hasn't?" In the obscurity I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">he made a gesture of despair. "They wiped us</seg><seg type="columnLine">out--simply wiped us out," he repeated again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He followed me, almost mechanically, into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dining-room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take some whisky," I said, pouring out a stiff</seg><seg type="columnLine">dose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He drank it. Then abruptly he sat down before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table, put his head on his arms, and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sob and weep like a little boy, in a perfect passion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of emotion, while I, with a curious forgetfulness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my own recent despair, stood beside him won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a long time before he could steady his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves to answer my questions, and then he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered perplexingly and brokenly. He was a driver</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the artillery, and had only come into action</seg><seg type="columnLine">about seven. At that time firing was going on</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the common, and it was said the first party</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Martians were crawling slowly towards their</seg><seg type="columnLine">second cylinder under cover of a metal shield.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later this shield staggered up on tripod legs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">became the first of the fighting machines I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. The gun he drove had been unlimbered near</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horsell, in order to command the sand-pits, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its arrival had precipitated the action. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">limber gunners went to the rear, his horse trod in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rabbit-hole and came down, throwing him into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">depression of the ground. At the same moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun exploded behind him, the ammunition blew</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, there was fire all about him, and he found him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self lying among a heap of charred dead men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead horses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I lay still," he said, "scared out of my wits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the fore-quarter of a horse atop of me. We'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">been wiped out. And the smell--good God! Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">burnt meat! I was hurt across the back by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall of the horse, and there I had to lie until I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">better. Just like parade it had been a minute be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore--then stumble, bang, swish!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wiped out!" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had hidden behind the dead horse for a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, peeping out furtively across the common. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cardigan men had tried a rush, in skirmishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">order, at the pit, simply to be swept out of exist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence. Then the monster had risen to its feet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had begun to walk leisurely to and fro across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">common, among the few fugitives, with its head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like hood turning about exactly like the head of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowled human being. A kind of arm carried a</seg><seg type="columnLine">complicated metallic case, about which green flashes</seg><seg type="columnLine">scintillated, and out of the funnel of this there</seg><seg type="columnLine">smote the Heat-Ray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few minutes there was, so far as the soldier</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see, not a living thing left upon the common,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and every bush and tree upon it that was not al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready a blackened skeleton was burning. The hus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">438</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sars had been on the road beyond the curvature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground, and he saw nothing of them. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the Maxims rattle for a time, and then be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come still. The giant saved Woking Station and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its cluster of houses until last; then in a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Heat-Ray was brought to bear, and the town</seg><seg type="columnLine">became a heap of fiery ruins. Then the thing shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the Heat-Ray, and, turning its back upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">artilleryman, began to waddle away towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smouldering pine-woods that sheltered the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder. As it did so, a second glittering Titan</seg><seg type="columnLine">built itself up out of the pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second monster followed the first, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the artilleryman began to crawl very cautious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly across the hot heather ash towards Horsell. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to get alive into the ditch along by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the road, and so escaped to Woking. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">his story became ejaculatory. The place was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passable. It seems there were a few people alive</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, frantic for the most part, and many burnt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scalded. He was turned aside by the fire, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hid among some almost scorching heaps of broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall as one of the Martian giants returned. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw this one pursue a man, catch him up in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its steely tentacles, and knock his head against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trunk of a pine-tree. At last, after nightfall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the artilleryman made a rush for it and got over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the railway embankment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since then he had been skulking along towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybury, in the hope of getting out of danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">London ward. People were hiding in trenches and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellars, and many of the survivors had made off</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards Woking Village and Send. He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">consumed with thirst until he found one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water mains near the railway arch smashed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water bubbling out like a spring upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was the story I got from him bit by bit. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew calmer telling me and trying to make me</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the things he had seen. He had eaten no food</seg><seg type="columnLine">since midday, he told me early in his narrative, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found some mutton and bread in the pantry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought it into the room. We lit no lamp, for fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of attracting the Martians, and ever and again our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands would touch upon bread or meat. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked, things about us came darkly out of the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, and the trampled bushes and broken rose-trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the window grew distinct. It would seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a number of men or animals had rushed across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lawn. I began to see his face, blackened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">haggard, as no doubt mine was also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN we had finished eating we went softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">upstairs to my study, and I looked again out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the open window. In one night the valley had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become a valley of ashes. The fires had dwindled</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. Where flames had been there were now</seg><seg type="columnLine">streamers of smoke; but the countless ruins of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattered and gutted houses and blasted and black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened trees that the night had hidden stood out now</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaunt and terrible in the pitiless light of dawn. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there some object had had the luck to es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape--a white railway signal here, the end of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">greenhouse there, white and fresh amidst the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreckage. Never before in the history of warfare</seg><seg type="columnLine">had destruction been so indiscriminate and so uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versal. And, shining with the growing light of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">east, three of the metallic giants stood about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit, their cowls rotating as though they were sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veying the desolation they had made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ever and again puffs of vivid green vapor</seg><seg type="columnLine">streamed up out of it towards the brightening dawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">--streamed up, whirled, broke, and vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond were the pillars of fire about Chobham.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They became pillars of bloodshot smoke at the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">What I Saw of the Destruction of Weybridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Shepperton</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS the dawn grew brighter we withdrew our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves from the window from which we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the Martians, and went very quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">downstairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The artilleryman agreed with me that the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no place to stay in. He proposed, he said, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make his way Londonward, and thence rejoin his</seg><seg type="columnLine">battery--No. 12, of the Horse Artillery. My plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to return at once to Leatherhead, and so greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the strength of the Martians impressed me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had determined to take my wife to Newhaven, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">go with her out of the country forthwith. For I</seg><seg type="columnLine">already perceived clearly that the country about</seg><seg type="columnLine">London must inevitably be the scene of a disastrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle before such creatures as these could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Between us and Leatherhead, however, lay the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third cylinder, with its guarding giants. Had I</seg><seg type="columnLine">been alone, I think I should have-taken my chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and struck across country. But the artilleryman</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissuaded me: "It's no kindness to the right sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wife," he said, "to make her a widow"; and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end I agreed to go with him, under cover of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods, northward as far as Street Cobham before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I parted with him. Thence I would make a big de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tour by Epsom to reach Leatherhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I should have started at once, but my companion</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been in active service, and he knew better than</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. He made me ransack the house for a flask,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he filled with whisky; and we lined every</seg><seg type="columnLine">available pocket with packets of biscuits and slices</seg><seg type="columnLine">of meat. Then we crept out of the house, and ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">as quickly as we could down the ill-made road by</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had come overnight. The houses seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted. In the road lay a group of three charred</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies close together, struck dead by the Heat-Ray;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and here and there were things that the people had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped--a clock, a slipper, a silver spoon, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">like poor valuables. At the corner turning up to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards the post-office a little cart, filled with boxes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and furniture, and horseless, heeled over on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken wheel. A cash-box had been hastily smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, and thrown under the ddbris.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Except the lodge at the Orphanage, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still on fire, none of the houses had suffered very</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly here. The Heat-Ray had shaved the chim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney-tops and passed. Yet, save ourselves, there did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not seem to be a living soul on Maybury Hill. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">majority of the inhabitants had escaped, I suppose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by way of the Old Woking road--the road I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken when I drove to Leatherhead--or they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WAR OF THE WORLDS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">439</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We went down the lane, by the body of the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in black, sodden now from the overnight hail, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke into the woods at the foot of the hill. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed through these towards the railway, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting a soul. The woods across the line were but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scarred and blackened ruins of woods; for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most part the trees had fallen, but a certain pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion still stood, dismal gray stems, with dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown foliage instead of green,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On our side the fire had done no more than scorch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearer trees; it had failed to secure its footing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In one place the woodmen had been at work on Sat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urday; trees, felled and freshly trimmed, lay in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing, with heaps of sawdust, by the sawing ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine and its engine. Hard by was a temporary hut,</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted. There was not a breath of wind this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, and everything was strangely still. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the birds were hushed, and as we hurried along, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the artilleryman talked in whispers, and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and again over our shoulders. Once or twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">we stopped to listen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a time we drew near the road, and as we did</seg><seg type="columnLine">so we heard the clatter of hoofs, and saw through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tree-Stems three cavalry soldiers riding slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards Woking. We hailed them, and they halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">while we hurried towards them. It was a lieutenant</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a couple of privates of the 8th Hussars, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand like a theodolite, which the artilleryman told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me was a heliograph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''You are the first men I've seen coming this way</seg><seg type="columnLine">this orning," said the lieutenant. "What's brew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HIS voice and face were eager. The men behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him stared curiously. The artilleryman jump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed down the bank into the road and saluted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gun destroyed last night, sir. Have been hiding.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trying to rejoin battery, sir. You'll come in sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Martians, T expect, about half a mile along</seg><seg type="columnLine">this road."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the dickens are they like?" asked the lieu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Giants in armor, sir. Hundred feet high. Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs and a body like 'luminium, with a mighty great</seg><seg type="columnLine">head in a hood, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get out!" said the lieutenant. "What confounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">nonsense!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll see, sir. They carry a kind of box, sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that shoots fire and strikes you dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What d'ye mean--a gun?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. sir," and the artilleryman began a vivid ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count of the Heat-Ray. Halfway through the lieu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenant interrupted him and looked up at me. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still standing on the bank by the side of the road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you see it?" said the lieutenant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's perfectly true," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said the lieutenant, "I suppose it's my</seg><seg type="columnLine">business to see it too. Look here"--to the artillery-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man--"we're detailed here clearing people out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their houses. You'd better go along and report your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to Brigadier-General Marvin, and tell him all</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know. He's at Weybridge. Know the way?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do," I said; and he turned his horse southward</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Half a mile, you say?" said he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At most," I answered, and pointed over the tree-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tops southwards. He thanked me and rode on, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw them no more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Further along we came upon a group of three</seg><seg type="columnLine">women and two children in the road, busy clearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a laborer's cottage. They had got hold of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little hand-truck, and were piling it up with un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean-looking bundles and shabby furniture. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all too assiduously engaged to talk to us as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By Byfleet Station we emerged from the pine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, and found the country calm and peaceful un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the morning sunlight. We were far beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">range of the Heat-Ray there, and had it not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the silent desertion of some of the houses, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirring movement of packing in others, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knot of soldiers standing on the bridge over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railway and staring down the line towards Woking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day would have seemed very like any other Sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several farm wagons and carts were moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">creakily along the road to Addlestone, and suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the gate of a field we saw, across a stretch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fiat meadow, six twelve-pounders standing neatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at equal distances and pointing toward Woking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The gunners stood by the guns waiting, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ammunition wagons were at a business-like dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance. The men stood almost as if under inspection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's good!" said I. "They will get one fail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot, at any rate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The artilleryman hesitated at the gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall go on," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Further on towards Weybridge, just over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge, there were a number of men in white fatigue</seg><seg type="columnLine">jackets throwing up a long rampart, and more guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's bows and arrows against the lightning, any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how," said the artilleryman. "They 'aven't seen that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire-beam yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The officers who were not actively engaged stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stared over the tree-tops south-westward, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men digging would stop every now and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stare in the same direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Byfleet was in a tumult, people packing, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">score of hussars, some of them dismounted, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">on horseback, were hunting them about. Three or</seg><seg type="columnLine">four black Government wagons, with crosses in</seg><seg type="columnLine">white circles, and an old omnibus, among other ve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hicles, were being loaded in the village street. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were scores of people, most of them sufficiently Sab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">batical to have assumed their best clothes. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers were having the greatest difficulty in mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them realize the gravity of their position. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw one shrivelled old fellow with a huge box and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">score or more of flower-pots containing orchids,</seg><seg type="columnLine">angrily expostulating with the corporal who would</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave them behind. I stopped and gripped his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know what's over there?" I said, point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the pine-tops that hid the Martians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eh?" said he, turning. "I was explainin' these</seg><seg type="columnLine">is vallyble."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Death!" I shouted. "Death is coming! Death!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, leaving him to digest that if he could, I hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried on after the artilleryman. At the corner I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked back. The soldier had left him, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still standing by his box with the pots of orchids</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the lid of it, and staring vaguely over the trees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">440</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NO one in Weybridge could tell us where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">headquarters were established; the whole place</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in such confusion as I had never seen in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">town before. Carts, carriages everywhere, the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishing miscellany of conveyances and horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh. The respectable inhabitants of the place, men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in golf and boating costumes, wives prettily dressed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were packing, riverside loafers energetically help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, children excited, and, for the most part, highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">delighted at this astonishing variation of their Sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day experiences. In the midst of it all the worthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicar was very pluekily holding an early celebra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and his bell was jangling out above the excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I and the artilleryman, seated on the step of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinking-fountain, made a very passable meal upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">what we had brought with us. Patrols of soldiers--</seg><seg type="columnLine">here no longer hussars, but grenadiers in white--</seg><seg type="columnLine">were warning people to move now or to take refuge</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their cellars as soon as the firing began. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw as we crossed the railway bridge that a grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing crowd of people had assembled in and about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railway-station, and the swarming platform was</seg><seg type="columnLine">piled with boxes and packages. The ordinary traf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fic had been stopped, I believe, in order to allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passage of troops and guns to Chertsey, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have heard since that a savage struggle occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">for places in the special trains that were put on at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a later hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE remained at Weybridge until mid-day, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that hour we found ourselves at the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">near Shepperton Lock where the Wey and Thames</seg><seg type="columnLine">oin. Part of the time we spent helping two old</seg><seg type="columnLine">'omen to pack a little cart. The Wey had a treble</seg><seg type="columnLine">nouth, and at this point boats are to be hired, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">here was a ferry across the river. On the Shep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perton side was an inn, with a lawn, and beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the tower of Shepperton Church--it has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced by a spire--rose above the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I-Iere we found an excited and noisy crowd of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fugitives. As yet the flight had not grown to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic, but there were already far more people than</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the boats going to and fro could enable to cross.</seg><seg type="columnLine">People came panting along under heavy burdens;</seg><seg type="columnLine">one husband and wife were even carrying a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">outhouse door between them, with some of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">household goods piled thereon. One man told us</seg><seg type="columnLine">he meant to try to get away from Shepperton Sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a lot of shouting, and one man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">even jesting. The idea people seemed to have here</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that the Martians were simply formidable hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man beings, who might attack and sack the town, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be certainly destroyed in the end. Every now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then people would glance nervously across the Wey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the meadows towards Chertsey, but everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">over there was still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Across the Thames, except just where the boats</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed, everything was quiet, in vivid contrast with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Surrey side. The people who landed there from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boats went tramping off down the lane. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">big ferry-boat had just made a journey. Three or</seg><seg type="columnLine">four soldiers stood on the lawn of the inn, staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">and jesting at the fugitives, without offering to</seg><seg type="columnLine">help. The inn was closed, as it was now within</seg><seg type="columnLine">prohibited hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that!" cried a boatman, and "Shut up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you fool!" said a man near me to a yelping dog.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the sound came again, this time from the di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection of Chertsey, a muffed thud--the sound of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fighting was beginning. Almost immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">unseen batteries across the river to our right, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen because of the trees, took up the chorus, firing</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily one after the other. A woman screamed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every one stood arrested by the sudden stir of bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle, near us and yet invisible to us. Nothing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be seen save flat meadows, cows feeding uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cernedly for the most part, and silvery pollard wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows motionless in the warm sunlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The sojers Ml stop 'em," said a woman beside me</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtfully. A haziness rose over the tree-tops.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the river, a puff of smoke that jerked up into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, and hung, and forthwith the ground heaved</seg><seg type="columnLine">under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashing two or three windows in the houses near,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaving us astonished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here they are!" shouted a man in a blue jersey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yonder! D'yer see them? Yonder!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quickly, one after the other, one, two, three, four</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the armored Martians appeared, far away over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little trees, across the flat meadows that stretch</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards Chertsey and striding hurriedly towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river. Little crowded figures they seemed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, going with a rolling motion and as fast as</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying birds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, advancing obliquely towards us, came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifth. Their armored bodies glittered in the sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they swept swiftly forward upon the guns, grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing rapidly larger as they drew nearer. One on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extreme left, the remotest, that is, flourished a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">case high in the air, and the ghostly terrible Heat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ray I had already seen on Friday night smote to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards Chertsey, and struck the town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At sight of these strange, swift, and terrible crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, the crowd along by the water's edge seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me to be for a moment horror-struck. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no screaming-or shouting, but a silence. Then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarse murmur and a movement of feet--a splash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the water. A man, too frightened to drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder, swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">round and sent me staggering with a blow from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner of his burden. A woman thrust at me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her hand and rushed past me. I turned, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the rush of the people, but I was not too terri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied for thought. The terrible Heat-Ray was in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. To get under water! That was it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get under water!" I shouted unheeded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I faced about again, and rushed towards the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching Martians--rushed right down the grav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">elly beach and headlong into the water. Others did</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same. A boatload of people putting back came</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaping out as I rushed past. The stones under my</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet were muddy and slippery, and the river was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">low that I ran perhaps twenty feet scarcely waist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep. Then as the Martian towered overhead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely a couple of hundred yards away, I flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself forward under the surface. The splashes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people in the boats leaping into the river sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed like thunderclaps in my ears. People were land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hastily on both sides of the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the Martianl machine took no more notice for</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WAR OF THE WORLDS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">441</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment of the people running this way and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a man would of the confusion of ants in a nest</seg><seg type="columnLine">against which his foot was kicked. When, half suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">focated, I raised my head above water the Martian's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood pointed at the batteries that were still firing</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the river, and as it advanced it swung loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">what must have been the generator of the Heat-Ray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN another moment it was on the bank, and in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stride wading half-way across. The knees of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">foremost legs bent at the further bank, and in an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other moment it had raised itself to its full height</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, close to the village of Shepperton. Forthwith</seg><seg type="columnLine">the six guns, which, unknown to any one on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right bank, had been hidden behind the outskirts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that village, fired simultaneously. The sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">near concussions, the last close upon the first, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">my heart jump. The monster was already raising</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case generating the Ileat-Ray, as the first shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst six yards above the hood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gave a cry of astonishment. I saw and thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of the other four Martian monsters: my</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention was riveted upon the nearer incident. Si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">multaneously two other shells burst in the air near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body as the hood twisted round in time to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceive, but not in time to dodge, the fourth shell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shell burst clean in the face of the thing. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood bulged, flashed, was whirled off in a dozen tat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered fragments of red flesh and glittering metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hit!" shouted I, with something between a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream and a cheer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard answering shouts from the people in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water about me. I could have leapt out of the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that momentary exultation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The decapitated colossus reeled like a drunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant; but it did not fall over. It recovered its bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance by a miracle, and, no longer heeding its steps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with the camera that fired the Heat-Ray now</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigidly upheld, it reeled swiftly upon Shepperton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The living intelligence, the Martian within the hood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was slain and splashed to the four winds of heaven,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the thing was now but a mere intricate device</seg><seg type="columnLine">of metal whirling to destruction. It drove along in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a straight line, incapable of guidance. It struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower of Shepperton Church, smashing it down as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impact of a battering ram might have done,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swerved aside, blundered on, and collapsed with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous impact into the river out of my sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A violent explosion shook the air, and a spout of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, steam, mud, and shattered metal, shot far up</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the sky. As the camera of the Heat-Ray hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water, the latter had incontinently flashed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam. In another moment a huge wave, like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">muddy tidal bore, but almost scaldingly hot, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeping round the bend upstream. I saw people</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling shorewards and heard their screaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shouting faintly above the seething and roar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Martian's collapse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the moment I heeded nothing of the heat, for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rot the patent need of self-preservation. I splashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the tumultuous water, pushing aside a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in black to do so, until T could see round the bend.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Half a dozen deserted boats pitched aimlessly upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the confusion of the waves. The fallen Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into sight downstream, lying across the river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for the most part submerged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreck-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">age, and through the tumultuously whirling wisps</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see, intermittently and vaguely, the gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs churning the water and flinging a splash and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spray of mud and froth into the air. The tentacles</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed and struck like living arms, and, save for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the helpless purposelessness of these movements, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as if some wounded thing struggled for life</seg><seg type="columnLine">amidst the waves. Enormous quantities of a ruddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown fluid were spurting up in noisy jets out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My attention was diverted from this sight by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">furious relling, like that of the thing called a siren</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our manufacturing towns. A man, knee-deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the towing-path, shouted inaudibly to me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed. Looking back, I saw the other Martians</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancing with gigantic strides down the river-bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the direction of Chertsey. The Shepperton</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns spoke this time unavailingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that I ducked at once under water, and, hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my breath until movement was an agony, blun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered painfully along under the surface as long as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could. The water was in a tumult about me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly growing hotter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When for a moment I raised my head to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath, and throw the hair and water from my eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steam was rising in a whirling white fog that</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first hid the Martians altogether. The noise was</seg><seg type="columnLine">deafening. Then I saw them dimly, colossal figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gray, magnified by the mist. They had passed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and two were stooping over the frothing tumul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuous ruins of their comrade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The third and fourth stood beside him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, one perhaps 200 yards from me, the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards Laleham. The generators of the Heat-Rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved high, and the hissing beams smote down this</seg><seg type="columnLine">way and that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The air was full of sound, a deafening and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusing conflict of noises, the clangorous din of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians, the crash of falling houses, the thud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, fences, sheds, flashing into flame, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crackling and roaring of fire. Dense black smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">was leaping up to mingle with the steam from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, and as the Heat-Ray went to and fro over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weybridge, its impact was marked by flashes of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">candescent white, that gave place at once to a smoky</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance of lurid flames. The nearer houses still stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">intact, awaiting their fate, shadowy, faint and pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lid in the stream, with the fire behind them going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fro.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment, perhaps, I stood there, breast-high</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the almost boiling water dumfounded at my posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, hopeless of escape. Through the reek I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the people who had been with me in the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambling out of the water through the reeds, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">little frogs hurrying through grass from the ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vance of a man, or running to and fro in utter dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">may on the towing-path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly the white flashes of the Heat-Ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">came leaping towards me. The houses caved in as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they dissolved at its touch, and darted out flames;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees changed to fire with a roar. It flickered</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down the towing-path, licking off the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">who ran this way and that, and came down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water's edge not fifty yards from where I stood. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept across the river to Shepperton, and the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its track rose in a boiling wheal crested with</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam. I turned shoreward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">442</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In another moment the huge wave, well-nigh at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boiling-point, had rushed upon me. I screamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud, and scalded, half blinded, agonized, I stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered through the leaping, hissing water towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shore. Had my foot stumbled it would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the end. I fell helplessly, in full sight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians, upon the broad, bare gravelly spit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">runs down to mark the angle of the Wey and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thames.

Had they left their comrade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pushed on forthwith, there was nothing at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time between them and London but batteries of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve-pounder guns, and they would certainly have</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the capital in advance of the tidings of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach; as sudden, dreadful and destructive their</seg><seg type="columnLine">advent would have been as the earthquake that de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed Lisbon a century ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But they were in no hurry.

And meanwhile</seg><seg type="columnLine">the military and naval authorities, now fully alive</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the tremendous power of their antagonists, work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed with furious energy. Every minute a fresh gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into position, until, before twilight, every</seg><seg type="columnLine">copse, every row of suburban villas on the hilly</seg><seg type="columnLine">slopes about Kingston and Richmond, masked an</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectant black muzzle. And through the charred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and desolated area--perhaps twenty square miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether--that encircled the Martian encampment</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Horsell Common, through charred and ruined</seg><seg type="columnLine">villages among the green trees, through the black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened and smoking arcades that had been but a day</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago pine spinneys, crawled the devoted scouts with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heliographs that were presently to warn the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunners of the Martian approach. But the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians now understood our command of artillery and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the danger of human proximity, and not a man ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured within a mile of either cylinder, save at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">price of his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would seem these giants spent the earlier part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the afternoon in going to and fro. transferring</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything from the second and third cylinders--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second in Addlestone Golf Links, and the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">at P.vrford--to their original pit upon Horsell Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon. Over that, above the blackened heather and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruined buildings that stretched far and wide, stood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one as sentinel, while the rest abandoned their vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting-machines and descended into the pit. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hard at work there far into the night, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">towering pillar of dense green smoke that rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefrom could be seen from the hills about Mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row, and even, it is said, from Banstead and Epsom</seg><seg type="columnLine">Downs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And while the Martians behind me were thus pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paring for their next sally, and in front of me Hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manity gathered for the battle, I made my way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with infinite pains and labor, from the fire and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke of burning Weybridge towards London.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw an abandoned boat, very small and remote,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifting down-stream, and, throwing off the most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my sodden clothes, I went after it, gained it, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped out of that destruction. There were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">oars in the boat, but I contrived to paddle, as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as my parboiled hands would allow, down the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards Halliford and Walton, going very tediously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and continually looking behind me, as you may well</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand. I followed the river because I consid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the water gave me my best chance of escape,</seg><seg type="columnLine">should these giants return.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hot water from the Martian's overthrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted down-stream with me, so that for the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of a mile I could see little of either bank. Once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, I made out a string of black figures hurry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing across the meadows from the direction of Wey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge. Halliford, it seemed, was quite deserted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and several of the houses facing the river were on</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. It was strange to see the place quite tranquil,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite desolate under the hot blue sky, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke and little threads of flame going straight up</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the heat of the afternoon. Never before had I</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen houses burning without the accompaniment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inconvenient crowd. A little further on the dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeds up the bank were smoking and glowing, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a line of fire inland was marching steadily across a</seg><seg type="columnLine">late field of hay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time T drifted, so painful and weary</seg><seg type="columnLine">was I after the violence I had been through, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">intense the heat upon the water. Then my fears</seg><seg type="columnLine">got the better of me again, and I resumed my pad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dling. The sun scorched my bare back. At last, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bridtre at Walton was coming into sight round</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bend, my fever and faintness overcame my fears</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I landed on the Middlesex bank, and lay down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly sick, amidst the long grass. I suppose the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time was then about four or five o'clock. I got up</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently, walked perhaps half a mile without meet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a soul, and then lay down again in the shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a hedge. I seem to remember talking wander-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inply to myself during that last spurt. I was also</seg><seg type="columnLine">very thirsty, and bitterly regretful I had drunk no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more water. It is a curious thing that I felt angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my wife: I cannot account for it, but my im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">potent desire to reach Leatherhead worried me ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T DO not clearly remember the arrival of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">J- curate, so that I probably dozed. I became aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him as a seated figure in soot-smudged shirt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeves, and with his upturned clean-shaven face</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring at a faint flickering that danced over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. The sky was what is called a mackerel sky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows and rows of faint down-plumes of cloud, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinted with the midsummer sunset.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WAR OF THE WORLDS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">443</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sat up, and at the rustle of my motion he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you any water?"

His face was a fair weakness, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chin retreated, and his hair lay in crisp, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaxen curls on his low forehead; his eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather large, pale blue, and blankly staring.

A nocturnal newspaper reporter, mistak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my brother for the traffic manager, whom he</seg><seg type="columnLine">does to a slight extent resemble, waylaid and tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to interview him. Few people, excepting the rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way officials, connected the breakdown with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have read, in another account of these events,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that on Sunday morning "all London was electrified</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the news from Woking." As a matter of fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was nothing to justify that very extravagant</seg><seg type="columnLine">phrase. Plenty of people in London did not hear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Martians until the panic of Monday morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those who did took some time to realize all that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily-worded telegrams in the Sunday papers con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veyed. The majority of people in London do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">read Sunday papers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The habit of personal security, moreover, is so</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply fixed in the Londoner's mind, and startling</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligence so much a matter of course in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">papers, that they could read without any personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremors: "About seven o'clock last night the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians came out of the cylinder, and, moving about</seg><seg type="columnLine">under an armor of metallic shields, have completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrecked Woking Station, with the adjacent houses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and massacred an entire battalion of the Cardigan</seg><seg type="columnLine">Regiment. No details are known. Maxims have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been absolutely useless against their armor; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field-guns have been disabled by them. Flying hus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sars have bepn galloping into Chertsey. The Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians appear to be moving slowly towards Chertsey</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Windsor. Great anxiety prevails in West Surrey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and earthworks are being thrown up to check the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance Londonwards." That was how the Sunday</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sun put it, and a clever and remarkably prompt</seg><seg type="columnLine">"hand-book" article in the Referee compared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair to a menagerie suddenly let loose in a village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one in London knew positively of the nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the armored Martians, and there was still a fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea that these monsters must be sluggish: "crawl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing," "creeping painfully"--such expressions occur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">red in almost all the earlier reports. None of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telegrams could have been written by an eye-witness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their advance. The Sunday papers printed sep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arate editions as further news came to hand, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">even in default of it. But there was practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing more to tell people until late in the after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon, when the authorities gave the press agencies</seg><seg type="columnLine">the news in their possession. It was stated that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people of Walton and Weybridge, and all that dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trict, were pouring along the roads Londonward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that was all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lyY brother went to church at the Foundling</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hospital in the morning, still in ignorance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had happened on the previous night There</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard allusions made to the invasion, and a spe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cial prayer for peace. Coming out. he bought a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Referee. He became alarmed at the news in this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went again to Waterloo Station to find out if</seg><seg type="columnLine">communication were restored. The omnibuses, car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riages, cyclists, and innumerable people walking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their best clothes, seemed scarcely affected by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange intelligence that the newsvendors were dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seminating. People were interested, or, if alarmed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarmed only on account of the local residents. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the station he heard for the first time that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Windsor and Chertsey lines were now interrupted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The porters told him that several remarkable tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grams had been received in the morning from By-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet and Chertsey Stations, but that these had</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly ceased. My brother could get very little</seg><seg type="columnLine">precise detail out of them. "There's fighting going</seg><seg type="columnLine">on about Weybridge," was the extent of their infor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The train service was now very much disorgan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized. Quite a number of people, who had been ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecting friends from places on the South-Western</seg><seg type="columnLine">network, were standing about the station. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray-headed old gentleman came and abused the</seg><seg type="columnLine">South-Western Company bitterly to my brother.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It wants showing up," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One or two trains came in from Richmond, Put-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney, and Kingston, containing people who had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">out for a day's boating, and found the locks closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a feeling of panic in the air. A man in a blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WAR OF THE WORLDS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">445</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and white blazer addressed my brother, full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange tidings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's hosts of people driving into Kingston in</seg><seg type="columnLine">traps and carts and things, with boxes of valuables</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all that," he said. "They come from Molesey</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Weybridge and Walton, and they say there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">been guns heard at Chertsey, heavy firing, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted soldiers have told them to get off at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">because the Martians are coming. We heard guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">firing at Hampton Court Station, but we thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was thunder. What the dickens does it all mean?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Martians can't get out of their pit, can they?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My brother could not tell him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afterwards he found that the vague feeling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm had spread to the clients of the underground</seg><seg type="columnLine">railway, and that the Sunday excursionists began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to return from all the South-Western "lungs"--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barnes, Wimbledon, Richmond Park, Kew, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth--at unnaturally early hours but not a soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">had anything but vague hearsay to tell of. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one connected with the terminus seemed ill-tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About five o'clock the gathering crowd in the sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was immensely excited by the opening of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of communication, which is almost invariably</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed, between the South-Eastern and the South-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Western stations, and the passage of carriage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trucks bearing huge guns, and carriages crammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with soldiers. These were the guns that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought up from Woolwich and Chatham to cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kingston. There was an exchange of pleasantries:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'll get eaten!" "We're the beast-tamers!" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so forth. A little while after that a squad of police</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into the station, and began to clear the public</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the platforms, and my brother went out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The church bells were ringing for evensong, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a squad of Salvation Army lasses came singing</seg><seg type="columnLine">down Waterloo Road. On the bridge a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">loafers were watching a curious brown scum that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came drifting down the stream in patches. The sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just setting, and the Clock Tower and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Houses of Parliament rose against one of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaceful skies it is possible to imagine, a sky of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold, barred with long transverse stripes of reddish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple cloud. There was talk of a floating body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of the men there, a reservist he said he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">told my brother he had seen the heliograph flicker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the west.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In Wellington Street my brother met a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sturdy roughs, who had just rushed out of Fleet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street with still wet newspapers and staring plac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ards. "Dreadful catastrophe!" they bawled one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other dpwn Wellington Street. "Fighting at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weybridge! Full description! Repulse of the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians! London said to be in danger!" He had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give threepence for a copy of that paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then it was, and then only, that he realized some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of the full power and terror of these mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sters. He learnt that they were not merely a hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful of small sluggish creatures, but that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds swaying vast mechanical bodies, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could move swiftly and smite with such power</seg><seg type="columnLine">that even the mightiest guns could not stand against</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were described as "vast spider-like ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines, nearly a hundred feet high, capable of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of an express train, and able to shoot out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam of intense heat." Masked batteries, chiefly</seg><seg type="columnLine">of field-guns, had been planted in the country about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horsell Common, and especially between the Woking</seg><seg type="columnLine">district and London. Five of the machines had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been seen moving towards the Thames, and one, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a freak of chance, had been destroyed. In the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases the shells had missed, and the batteries had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been at once annihilated by the Heat-Rays. Heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">losses of soldiers were mentioned, but the tone of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the despatch was optimistic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Martians had been repulsed; they were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">invulnerable. They had retreated to their triangle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cylinders again, in the circle about Woking. Sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nallers with heliographs were pushing forward upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from all sides. Guns were in rapid transit</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Windsor, Portsmouth, Aldershot, Woolwich--</seg><seg type="columnLine">even from the north; among others, long wire guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ninety-five tons from Woolwich. Altogether one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and sixteen were in position or being hast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily laid, chiefly covering London. Never before in</seg><seg type="columnLine">England had there been such a vast or i apid concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tration of military material.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Any further cylinders that fell, it was hoped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be destroyed at once by high explosives, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being rapidly manufactured and distributed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No doubt, ran the report, the situation was of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangest and gravest description, but the public</seg><seg type="columnLine">was exhorted to avoid and discourage panic. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt the Martians were strange and terrible in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the extreme, but at the outside there could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than twenty of them against our millions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The authorities had reason to suppose, from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of tho cylinders, that at che outside there could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be more than five in each cylinder--fifteen al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">together. And one at least was disposed of--per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps more. The public would be fairly warned of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the approach of danger, and elaborate measures</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being taken for the protection of the people in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the threatened south-western suburbs. And so, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">reiterated assurances of the safety of London, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the confidence of the authorities to cope with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty, this quasi proclamation closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THIS was printed in enormous type, so fresh that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paper was still wet, and there had been no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to add a word of comment. It was curious, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother said, to see how ruthlessly the other con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tents of the paper had been hacked and taken out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give this place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All down Wellington Street, people could be seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluttering out the pink sheets and reading, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strand was suddenly noisy with the voices of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">army of hawkers following these pioneers. Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">came scrambling off buses to secure copies. Cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly this news excited people intensely, whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">their previous apathy. The shutters of a map-shop</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Strand were being taken down, my brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, and a man in his Sunday raiment, lemon-yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low gloves even, was visible inside the window, hast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily fastening maps of Surrey to the glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Going on along the Strand to Trafalgar Square,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paper in his hand, my brother saw some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fugitives from West Surrey. There was a man driv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a cart such as greengrocers use, and his wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">and two boys and some articles of furniture. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was driving from the direction of Westminster</seg><seg type="columnLine">446</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Bridge, and close behind him came a hay wagon</seg><seg type="columnLine">with five or six respectable-looking people in it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some boxes and bundles. The faces of these people</seg><seg type="columnLine">were haggard, and their entire appearance con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trasted conspicuously with the Sabbath-best ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance of the people on the omnibuses. People in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashionable clothing peeped at them out of cabs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They stopped at the Square as if undecided which</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to take, and finally turned eastward along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strand. Some way after these came a man in work-,</seg><seg type="columnLine">day clothes, riding one of those old-fashioned tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cycles with a small front-wheel. He was dirty and</seg><seg type="columnLine">white in the face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My brother turned down towards Victoria, and met</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of such people. He had a vague idea that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might see something of me. He noticed an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual number of police regulating the traffic. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the refugees were exchanging news with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people on the omnibuses. One was professing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seen the Martians. "Boilers on stilts, I tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, striding along like men." Most of them were</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited and animated by their strange experience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond Victoria the public-houses were doing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lively trade with these arrivals. At all the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners groups of people were reading papers, talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing excitedly, or staring at these unusual Sunday</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitors. They seemed to increase as night drew on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until at last the roads, my brother said, were like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Epsom High Street on a Derby Day. My brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">addressed several of these fugitives and got unsatis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">factory answers from most.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> None of them could tell him any news of Woking</seg><seg type="columnLine">except one man, who assured him that Woking had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been entirely destroyed on the previous night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I come from Byfleet," he said; "a man on a bi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cycle came through the place in the early morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ran from door to door warning us to come away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then came soldiers. We went out to look, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were clouds of smoke to the south--nothing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke, and not a soul coming that way. Then we</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the guns at Chertsey, and folks coming from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weybridge. So Pve locked up my house and come</seg><seg type="columnLine">on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that time there was a strong feeling in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets that the authorities were to blame for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">incapacity to dispose of the invaders without all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">inconvenience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About eight o'clock, a noise of heavy firing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinctly audible all over the south of London. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother could not hear it for the traffic in the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets, but by striking through the quiet back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets to the river he was able to distinguish it</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite plainly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked back from Westminster to his apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments near Regent's Park about two. He was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">very anxious on my account, and disturbed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident magnitude of the trouble. His mind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclined to run, even as mine had run on Saturday,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on military details. He thought of all those silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectant guns, of the suddenly nomadic country-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side; he tried to imagine "boilers on stilts" a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet high.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were one or two cartloads of refugees pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing along Oxford Street, and several in the Maryle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone Road, but so slowly was the news spreading</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Regent Street and Portland Road were full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their usual Sunday night promenaders, albeit they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">talked in groups, and along the edge of Regent's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Park there were as many silent couples "walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">out" together under the scattered gas-lamps as ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been. The night was warm and still, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little oppressive, the sound of guns continued in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termittently, and after midnight there seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sheet lightning in the south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He read and re-read the paper, fearing the worst</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened to me. He was restless, and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">supper prowled out again aimlessly. He returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tried to divert his attention by his examination</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes in vain. He went to bed a little after mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, and he was awakened out of some lurid</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams in the small hours of Monday by the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of door-knockers, feet running in the street, distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">drumming, and a clamor of bells. Red reflections</seg><seg type="columnLine">danced on the ceiling. For a moment he lay aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished, wondering whether day had come or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world had gone mad. Then he jumped out of bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ran to the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His room was an attic, and as he thrust his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, up and down the street there were a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoes to the noise of his window-sash, and heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every kind of night disarray appeared. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiries were being shouted. "They are coming!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">bawled a policeman, hammering at the door; "the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians are coming!" and hurried to the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The noise of drumming and trumpeting came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Albany Street Barracks, and every church</seg><seg type="columnLine">within earshot was hard at work killing sleep with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vehement disorderly tocsin. There was a noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">of doors opening, and window after window in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses opposite flashed from darkness into yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">illumination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up the street came galloping a closed carriage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bursting abruptly into noise at the corner, rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a clattering climax under the window, and dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">away slowly in the distance. Close on the rear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this came a couple of cabs, the forerunners of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long procession of flying vehicles, going for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most part to Chalk Farm Station, where the North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Western special trains were loading up, instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of coming down the gradient into Euston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TT'OR a long time my brother stared out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">A window in blank astonishment, watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">policemen hammering at door after door, and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">livering their incomprehensible message. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door behind him opened, and the man who lodged</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the landing came in, dressed only in shirt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trousers, and slippers, his braces loose about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist, his hair disordered from his pillow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the devil is it?" he asked. "A fire? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">a devil of a row!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They both craned their heads out of the window,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straining to hear what the policemen were shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. People were coming out of the side-streets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and standing in groups at the corners talking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the devil is it all about?" said my broth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er's fellow-lodger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My brother answered him vaguely and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress, running with each garment to the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order to miss nothing of the growing excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the streets. And presently men selling</seg><seg type="columnLine">unnaturally early newspapers came bawling into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street:</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WAR OF THE WORLDS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">447</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "London in danger of suffocation!

It was the dawn of the great panic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">London, which had gone to bed on Sunday night</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupid and inert, was awakened in the small hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Monday morning to a vivid sense of danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unable from his window to learn what was hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pening, my brother went down and out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street, just as the sky between the parapets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the houses grew pink with the early dawn. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying people on foot and in vehicles grew more</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous every moment. "Black Smoke!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard people crying, and again "Black Smoke!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The contagion of such a unanimous fear was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">evitable. As my brother hesitated on the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">step, he saw another newsvendor approaching him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and got a copy forthwith. The man was running</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with the rest, and selling his papers as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran, for a shilling each--a grotesque mingling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">profit and panic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And from this paper my brother read that catas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trophic despatch of the Commander-in-Chief:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Martians are able to discharge enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds of a black and poisonous vapour by means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rockets.

"Fire!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bells of the neighboring church made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jangling tumult, a cart carelessly driven smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">amidst shrieks and curses against the water-trough</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the street. Sickly yellow light went to and fro</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the houses, and some of the passing cabs flaunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">unextinguished lamps.

So far as one can ascertain from the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flicting accounts that have been put forth, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">majority of them remained busied with prepara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions in the Horsell pit until nine that night, hurry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on some operation that disengaged huge vol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umes of green smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But three certainly came out about eight o'clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, advancing slowly and cautiously, made their</seg><seg type="columnLine">way through Byfleet and Pyrford towards Ripley</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Weybridge, and so came in sight of the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectant batteries against the setting sun. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians did not advance in a body, but in a line,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each perhaps a mile and a half from his nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow. They communicated with each other by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of siren-like howls, running up and down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scale from one note to another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was this howling and the firing of the guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Ripley and St. George's Hill that we had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Upper Halliford. The Ripley gunners, unsea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soned artillery volunteers who ought never to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been placed in such a position, fired one wild, pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mature, ineffectual volley, and bolted on horse and</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot through the deserted village, and the Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked over their guns serenely without using</seg><seg type="columnLine">his Heat-Ray, stepped gingerly among them, passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of them, and so came unexpectedly upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guns in Painshill Park, which he destroyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The St. George's Hill men, however, were better</seg><seg type="columnLine">led or of a better mettle. Hidden by a pine-wood</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they were, they seem to have been quite unex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected by the Martian nearest to them. They laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">their guns as deliberately as if they had been on</seg><seg type="columnLine">parade, and fired at about a thousand yards' range.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shells flashed all round the Martian, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw him advance a few paces, stagger, and go</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. Everybody yelled together, and the guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">were reloaded in frantic haste. The overthrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian set up a prolonged ululation, and imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately a second glittering giant, answering him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared over the trees to the south. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem that a leg of the tripod had been smashed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the shells. The whole of the second volley</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew wide of the Martian on the ground, and simul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneously both his companions brought their Heat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rays to bear on the battery. The ammunition</seg><seg type="columnLine">blew up. the pine-trees all about the guns flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into fire, and only one or two of the men who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">already running over the crest of the hill escaped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After this it would seem that the three took</seg><seg type="columnLine">counsel together and halted, and the scouts who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were watching them report that they remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely stationary for the next half-hour. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian who had been overthrown crawled tedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously out of his hood, a small brown figure, oddly</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestive from that distance of a speck of light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and apparently engaged in the repair of his sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">448</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">port. About nine he had finished, for his cowl</seg><seg type="columnLine">was then seen above the trees again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a few minutes past nine that night when</seg><seg type="columnLine">these three sentinels were joined by four other</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians, each carrying a thick black tube. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar tube was handed to each of the three, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seven proceeded to distribute themselves at</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal distances along a curved line between St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">George's Hill, Weybridge, and the village of Send,</seg><seg type="columnLine">south-west of Ripley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A dozen rockets sprang out of the hills before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them so soon as they began to move, and warned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waiting batteries about Ditton and Esher. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">*he same time four of their Fighting Machines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">imilarly armed with tubes, crossed the river, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of them, black against the western sky, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into sight of myself and the curate as we hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearily and painfully along the road that runs</seg><seg type="columnLine">northward out of Halliford. They moved, as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to us, upon a cloud, for a milky mist cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the fields and rose to a third of their height.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this sight the curate cried faintly in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat, and began running; but I knew it was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">good running from a Martian, and I turned aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the broad ditch by the side of the road. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked back, saw what I was doing, and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to join me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two Martians halted, the nearer to us stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and facing Sunbury, the remoter being a gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">indistinctness towards the evening star, away to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards Staines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE occasional howling of the Martians had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased; they took up their positions in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge crescent about their cylinders in absolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence. It was a crescent with twelve miles be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween its horns. Never since the devising of gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder was the beginning of a battle so still. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">us and to an observer about Ripley it would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">had precisely the same effect--the Martians seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in solitary possession of the darkling night, lit only</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it was by the slender moon, the stars, the after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow of the daylight, and the ruddy glare from St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">George's Hill and the woods of Painshill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But facing that crescent everywhere, at Staines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hounslow, Ditton, Esher, Ockham, behind hills and</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods south of the river and across the flat grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">meadoWS to the north of it, wherever a cluster of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees or village houses gave sufficient cover, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns were waiting. The signal rockets burst and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rained their sparks through the night and vanished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the spirit of all those watching batteries rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a tense expectation. The Martians had but to</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance into the line of fire, and instantly those</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless black forms of men, those guns glitter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing so darkly in the early night, would explode into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thunderous fury of battle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No doubt the thought that was uppermost in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand of those vigilant minds, even as it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">uppermost in mine, was the riddle how much they</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood of us. Did they grasp that we in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions were organized, disciplined, working to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether? Or did they interpret our spurts of fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sudden stinging of our shells, our steady in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestment of their encampment, as we should the</seg><seg type="columnLine">furious unanimity of onslaught in a disturbed hive</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of bees? Did they dream they might exterminate</seg><seg type="columnLine">us? (At that time no one knew what food they</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed.) A hundred such questions struggled to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether in my mind as I watched that vast sentinel</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape. And in the back of my mind was the sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all the huge unknown and hidden forces London-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. Had they prepared pitfalls? Were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder-mills at Hounslow ready as a snare? Would</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Londoners have the heart and courage to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a greater Moscow of their mighty province of</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, after an interminable time as it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us, crouching and peering through the hedge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a sound like the distant concussion of a gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another nearer, and then another. And then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian beside us raised his tube on high and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged it gunwise, with a heavy report that made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground heave. The Martian towards Staines</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered him. There was no flash, no smoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply that loaded detonation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was so excited by these heavy minute-guns fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing one another that I so far forgot my per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal safety and my scalded hands as to clamber up</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the hedge and stare towards Sunbury. As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did so a second report followed, and a big projectile</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtled overhead towards Hounslow. I expected at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least to see smoke or fire or some such evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its work. But all I saw was the deep-blue sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">above, with one solitary star, and the white mist</seg><seg type="columnLine">spreading wide and low beneath. And there had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been no crash, no answering explosion. The silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">was restored ; the minute lengthened to three.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What has happened?" said the curate, standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">up beside me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Heaven knows!" said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A bat flickered by and vanished. A distant tumult</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shouting began and ceased. I looked again at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Martian, and saw he was now moving eastward</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the river-bank, with a swift rolling motion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every moment I expected the fire of some hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">battery to spring upon him; but the evening calm</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unbroken. The figure of the Martian grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller as he receded, and presently the mist and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gathering night had swallowed him up. By a</seg><seg type="columnLine">common impulse we clambered higher. Towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sunbury was a dark appearance, as though a coni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal hill had suddenly come into being there, hiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">our view of the further country; and then, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moter across the river, over Walton, we saw an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other such summit. These hill-like forms grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower and broader even as we stared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moved by a sudden thought, I looked northward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there I perceived a third of these cloudy black</seg><seg type="columnLine">kopjes had arisen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything had suddenly become very still. Far</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to the south-east, marking the quiet, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the Martians hooting to one another, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the air quivered again with the distant thud</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their guns. But the earthly artillery made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, at the time we could not understand these</seg><seg type="columnLine">things; but later I was to learn the meaning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these ominous kopjes that gathered in the twilight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each of the Martians, standing in the great cres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent I have described, had discharged at some un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known signal, by means of the gun-like tube he</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried, a huge canister over whatever hill, copse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WAR OF THE WORLDS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">449</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cluster of houses, or other possible cover for guns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanced to be in front of him. Some fired only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these, some two, as in the case of the one we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen; the one at Ripley is said to have dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged no fewer than five at that time. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">canisters smashed on striking the ground--they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not explode--and incontinently disengaged an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous volume of a heavy inky vapour, coiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pouring upwards in a huge and ebony cumulus</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud, a gaseous hill that sank and spread itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly over the surrounding country. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of that vapour, the inhaling of its pungent</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisps, was death to all that breathes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was heavy, this vapour, heavier than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">densest smoke, so that, after the first tumultuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">uprush and outflow of its impact, it sank down</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air and poured over the ground in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner rather liquid than gaseous, abandoning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hills, and streaming into the valleys and ditches</seg><seg type="columnLine">and water-courses, even as I have heard the car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonic acid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is</seg><seg type="columnLine">wont to do. And where it came upon water some</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemical action occurred, and the surface would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly and made way for more. The scum was</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely insoluble, and it is a strange thing, see-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the instant effect of the gas, that one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink the water from which it had been strained</seg><seg type="columnLine">without hurt. The vapour did not diffuse as a true</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas would do. It hung together in banks, flowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">sluggishly down the slope of the land and driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">reluctantly before the wind, and very slowly it</seg><seg type="columnLine">combined with the mist and moisture of the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sank to the earth in the form of dust. Save</seg><seg type="columnLine">that an unknown element giving a group of four</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines in the blue of the spectrum is concerned, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are still entirely ignorant of the nature of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion</seg><seg type="columnLine">was over, the black smoke clung so closely to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, even before its precipitation, that, fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet up in the air, on the roofs and upper stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">of high houses and on great trees, there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of escaping its poison altogether, as was</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved even that night at Street Cobham and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ditton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE man who escaped at the former place tells</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wonderful story'of the strangeness of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">coiling flow, and how he looked down from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">church spire and saw the houses of the village</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising like ghosts out of its inky nothingness. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a day and a half he remained there, weary, starv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and sun-scorched, the earth under the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky and against the prospect of the distant hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">a velvet black expanse, with red roofs, green trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, later, black-veiled shrubs and gates, barns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">outhouses, and walls, rising here and there into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sunlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that was at Street Cobham where the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapour was allowed to remain until it sank of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">own accord into the ground. As a rule, the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians, when it had served its purpose, cleared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air of it again by wading into it and directing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jet of steam upon it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That they did with the vapour-banks near us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we saw in the starlight from the window of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted house at Upper Halliford, whither we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned. From there we could see the search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights on Richmond Hill and Kingston Hill going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fro, and about eleven the window rattled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we heard the sound of the huge siege guns that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been put in position there. These continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">intermittently for the space of a quarter of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, sending chance shots at the invisible Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians at Hampton and Ditton, and then the pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">beams of the electric light vanished, and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced by a bright red glow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the fourth cylinder fell--a brilliant green</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteor--as I learnt afterwards, in Bushey Park.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before the guns on the Richmond and Kingston</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of hills began, there was a fitful cannonade far</seg><seg type="columnLine">away in the south-west, due, I believe, to guns being</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired haphazard before the black vapour could over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelm the gunners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, setting about it as methodically as men might</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke out a wasps' nest, the Martians spread this</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange stifling vapour over the Londonward coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try. The horns of the crescent slowly spread apart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until at last they formed a line from Hanwell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coombe and Malden. All night through their de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structive tubes advanced. Never once, after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian at St. George's Hill was brought down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did they give the artillery the ghost of a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">against them. Wherever there was a possibility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns being laid for them unseen, a fresh canister</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the black vapour was discharged, and where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns were openly displayed the Heat-Ray was</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought to bear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By midnight the blazing trees along the slopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Richmond Park, and the glare of Kingston Hill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw their light upon a network of black smoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blotting out the whole Valley of the Thames, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">extending as far as the eye could reach. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">through this two Martians slowly waded, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned their hissing steam-jets this way and that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Martians were sparing of the Heat-Ray that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, either because they had but a limited supply</seg><seg type="columnLine">of materia! for its production, or because they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not wish to destroy the country, but only to crush</seg><seg type="columnLine">and overawe the opposition they had aroused. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter aim they certainly succeeded.

As soon as this was over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the toad was replaced, and the squatting giant tran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quilly regarded the landscape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond the hollow or dell lay an undulating coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try, with clumps of bush. A sound in the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance attracted attention; glimpses of color</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved through the scrub; and a party of three or</seg><seg type="columnLine">four dozen men were seen approaching, most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as gigantifc as our first acquaintance. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">marched in order, armed with great spears, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearing colored loin straps with a sort of sporran,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed, in front. They were preceded by an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligent-looking negro of ordinary stature armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a club, and accompanied by two figures more</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable than the giants. They were under-sized,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost dwarfish, with huge heads, and enormously</seg><seg type="columnLine">fat and brawny both in face and body. They wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright yellow cloaks over their black shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At sight of them, our giant rose and stood stiffly</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the side of his basket. The party approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">and halted. Some order was given, a giant stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from the ranks towards ours, picked up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">basket, handed it stiffly to the newcomer, and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">into place in the little company. We were clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">witnessing some regular routine of relieving guard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was racking my brains to think what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole thing might signify--guards, giants, dwarfs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">toads--when to my dismay I heard an exclamation</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was one of those damned porters, a confounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow who always liked to show his independence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bored with waiting, I suppose, he had self-impor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tautly crept up to see what it was all about, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden sight of the company of giants had been too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much for his nerves. I made a signal to lie quiet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was too late. The exclamation had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard; the leader gave a quick command, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giants rushed up and out in two groups to sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">round us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Violence and resistance were clearly out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question. With my heart in my mouth, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much dignity as I could muster, I jumped up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw out my empty hands, at the same time telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tracker not to shoot. A dozen spears seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">towering over me, but none were launched; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader ran up the slope and gave a command. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">giants came up and put my hands through their</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms. The tracker and the porter were herded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front at the spear point. The other porters now</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered there was something amiss, and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shout and run away, with half the spearmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">after them. We three were gently but firmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">marched down and across the hollow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I understood nothing of the language, and called</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my tracker to try his hand. It turned out that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was some dialect of which he had a little un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstanding, and we could learn nothing save the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that we were being taken to some superior</seg><seg type="columnLine">authority.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For two days we were marched through pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">park-like country, with villages at intervals. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and then some new monstrosity in the shape of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dwarf or an incredibly fat woman or a two-headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal would be visible, until I thought I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled on the original source of supply of circus</seg><seg type="columnLine">freaks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The country at last began to slope gently down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a pleasant river-valley; and presently we neared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the capital. It turned out to be a really large town</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Africa, its mud walls of strangely impressive</seg><seg type="columnLine">architectural form, with their heavy, slabby but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tresses, and giants standing guard upon them. See-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing us approach, they shouted, and a crowd poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the nearest gate. My God, what a crowd! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was getting used to giants by this time, but here</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a regular Barnum and Bailey show; more semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwarfs; others like them but more so--one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not tell whether the creatures were precociously</seg><seg type="columnLine">mature children or horribly stunted adults; others</seg><seg type="columnLine">portentously fat, with arms like sooty legs of mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, and rolls and volutes of fat crisping out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their steatopygous posteriors; still others preco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciously senile and wizened, others hateful and im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">becile in looks. Of course, there were plenty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary negroes too, but enough of the extraordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary to make one feel pretty queer. Soon after we</seg><seg type="columnLine">got inside, I suddenly noted something else which</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared inexplicable--a telephone wire, with per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly good insulators, running across from tree to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree. A telephone--in an unknown African town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gave it up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT another surprise was in store for me. I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a figure pass across from one large building to</seg><seg type="columnLine">another--a figure unmistakably that of a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. In the first place, it was wearing white ducks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sun helmet; in the second, it had a pale face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned at the sound of our cavalcade and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood looking a moment; then walked towards us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Halloa!" I shouted. "Do you speak English?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he answered, "but keep quiet a moment,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and began talking quickly to our leaders, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated him with the greatest deference. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped back to me and spoke rapidly: "You are</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be taken into the council hall to be examined:</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I will see to it that no harm comes to you. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a forbidden land to strangers, and you must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared to be held up for a time. You will be sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to see me in the temple buildings as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the formalities are over, and I'll explain things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They want a bit of explaining," he added with a dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh. "By the way, my name is I-Iascombe, lately</seg><seg type="columnLine">research worker at Middlesex Hospital, now relig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ious adviser to His Majesty King Mgobe." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed again and pushed ahead. He was an inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esting figure--perhaps fifty years old, spare body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin face, with a small beard, and rather sunken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hazel eyes. As for his expression, he looked cynical,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but also as if he were interested in life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time we were at the entrance to the hall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our giants formed up outside, with my men behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and only I and the leader passed in. The ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amination was purely formal, and remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">chiefly for the ritual and solemnity which charac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terized all the actions of the couple of dozen fine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking men in long robes who were our examiners.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My men were herded off to some compound. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">escorted down to a little hut, furnished with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt at European style, where I found Has-</seg><seg type="columnLine">combe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as we were alone I was after him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my questions. "Now you can tell me. Where are</seg><seg type="columnLine">we? What is the meaning of all this circus busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE TISvSUE CULTURE KING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">453</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and this menagerie of monstrosities? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">how do you come here?" He cut me short. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long story, so let me save time by telling it my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I am not going to tell it as he told it; but will try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give a more connected account, the result of</seg><seg type="columnLine">many later talks with him, and of my own observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hascombe had been a medical student of great</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise; and after his degree had launched out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">research. He had first started on parasitic proto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zoa, but had given that up in favor of tissue cul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture; from these he had gone off to cancer research,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from that to a study of developmental phys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iology. Later a big Commission on sleeping sick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness had been organized, and Hascombe, restless</seg><seg type="columnLine">and eager for travel, had pulled wires and got him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self appointed as one of the scientific staff sent to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Africa. He was much impressed with the view that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild game acted as a reservoir for the Trypanosoma</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambicme. When he learned of the extensive mi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grations of game, he saw here an important pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible means of spreading the disease and asked leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go up country to investigate the whole problem.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the Commission as a whole had finished its</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, he was allowed to stay in Africa with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">other white man and a company of porters to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he could discover. His white companion was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a laboratory technician, a taciturn non-commis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sioned officer of science called Aggers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is no object in telling of their experiences</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. Suffice it that they lost their way and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the hands of this same tribe. That was fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago: and Aggers was now long dead--as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">result of a wound inflicted when he was caught,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a couple of years, trying to escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On their capture, they too had been examined in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the council chamber, and Hascombe (who had in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terested himself in a dilettante way in anthropology</seg><seg type="columnLine">as in most other subjects of scientific inquiry) was</seg><seg type="columnLine">much impressed by what he described as the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceedingly religious atmosphere. Everything was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done with an elaboration of ceremony; the chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed more priest than king, and performed vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous rites at intervals, and priests were busy at some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of altar the whole time. Among other things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he noticed that one of their rites was connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">with blood. First the chief and then the councillors</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in turn requisitioned for a drop of vital fluid</seg><seg type="columnLine">pricked from their finger-tips, and the mixture, held</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a little vessel, was slowly evaporated over a flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of Hascombe's men spoke a dialect not un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that of their captors, and one was acting as</seg><seg type="columnLine">interpreter. Things did not look too favorable. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">country was a "holy place," it seemed, and the tribe</seg><seg type="columnLine">a "holy race." Other Africans who trespassed there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if not killed, were enslaved, but for the most part</seg><seg type="columnLine">they let well alone, and did not trespass. White</seg><seg type="columnLine">men they had heard of, but never seen till now, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the debate was what to do--to kill, let go, or en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave? To let them go was contrary to all their</seg><seg type="columnLine">principles: the holy place would be defiled if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">news of it were spread abroad. To enslave them--</seg><seg type="columnLine">yes; but what were they good for? and the Council</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to feel an instinctive dislike for these other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored creatures. Hascombe had an idea. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the interpreter. "Say this: 'You revere</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Blood. So do we white men; but we do more--</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can render visible the blood's hidden nature and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reality, and with permission I will show this great</seg><seg type="columnLine">magic.' " He beckoned to the bearer who carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">his precious microscope, set it up, drew a drop of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood from the tip of his finger with his knife, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted it on a slide under a coverslip. The big-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wigs were obviously interested. They whispered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other. At length, "Show us," commanded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HASCOMBE demonstrated his preparation with</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater interest than he had ever done to first-</seg><seg type="columnLine">year medical students in the old days. He explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the blood was composed of little people of vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous sorts, each with their own lives, and that to spy</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them thus gave us new powers over them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The elders were more or less impressed. At any</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate the sight of these thousands of corpuscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they could see nothing before made them</seg><seg type="columnLine">think, made them realize that the white man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">power which might make him a desirable servant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They would not ask to see their own blood for</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear that the sight would put them into the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those who saw it. But they had blood drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a slave. Hascombe asked too for a bird, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was able to create a certain interest by showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">how different were the little people of its blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell them," he said to the interpreter, "that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have many other powers and magics which I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">show them if they will give me time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The long and short of it was that he and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">party were spared--He said he knew then what one</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt when the magistrate said: "remanded for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">week."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had been attracted by one of the elder states-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of the tribe--a tall, powerful-looking man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle-age; and was agreeably surprised when this</seg><seg type="columnLine">man came round next day to see him. Hascombe</seg><seg type="columnLine">later nicknamed him the Prince-Bishop, for his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bination of the qualities of the statesman and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ecclesiastic: his real name was Bugala. He was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to discover more about Hascombe's myste-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rious powers and resources as Hascombe was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn what he could of the people into whose hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had fallen, and they met almost every evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">and talked far into the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bugala's inquiries were as little prompted as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hascombe's by a purely academic curiosity. Im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed himself by the microscope, and still more by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effect which it had had on his colleagues, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to find out whether by utilizing the powers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the white man he could not secure his own ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vancement. At length, they struck a bargain. Bu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gala would see to it that no harm befell Hascombe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Hascombe must put his resources and powers</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the disposal of the Council; and Bugala would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take good care to arrange matters so that he him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self benefited. So far as Hascombe could make out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bugala imagined a radical change in the national</seg><seg type="columnLine">religion, a sort of reformation based on Hascombe's</seg><seg type="columnLine">conjuring tricks; and that he would emerge as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">High Priest of this changed system.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hascombe had a sense of humor, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tickled. It seemed pretty clear that they could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape, at least for the present. That being so, why</seg><seg type="columnLine">not take the opportunity of doing a little research</seg><seg type="columnLine">4vt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">work at state expense--an opportunity which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his like were always clamoring for at home?</seg><seg type="columnLine">His thoughts began to run away with him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would find out all he could of the rites and super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitions of the tribe. He would, by the aid of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge and his scientific skill, exalt the details</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these rites, the expression of those superstitions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole physical side of their religiosity, on to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new level which should to them appear truly miracu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would not be worth my troubling to tell all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">negotiations, the false starts, the misunderstand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings. In the end he secured what he wanted--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">building which could be used as a laboratory; an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlimited supply of slaves for the lower and priests</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the higher duties of laboratory assistants, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the promise that when his scientific stores were ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted they would do their best to secure others</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the coast--a promise w!iich was scrupulously</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept, so that he never went short for lack of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">money could buy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He next applied himself diligently to a study of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their religion and found that it was built round</seg><seg type="columnLine">various main motifs. Of these, the central one was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the belief in the divinity and tremendous impor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance of the Priest-King. The second was a form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ancestor-worship. The third was an animal cult,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in particular of the more grotesque species of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">African fauna. The fourth was sex, con variazioni.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hascombe reflected on these facts. Tissue culture;</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimental embryology; endocrine treatment; ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tificial parthen6genesis. He laughed and said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself: "Well, at least I can try, and it ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be amusing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT was how it all started. Pehaps the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of giving some idea of how it had devel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oped will be for me to tell my own impressions when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hascombe took me round his laboratories. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole quarter of the town was devoted entirely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">religion--it struck me as excessive, but Hascombe</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminded me that Tibet spends one-fifth of its rev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enues on melted butter to burn before its shrines.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Facing the main square was the chief temple, built</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressively enough of solid mud. On either side</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the apartments where dwelt the servants of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gods and administrators of the sacred rites.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Behind were Hascombe's laboratories, some built of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud, others, under his later guidance, of wood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were guarded night and day by patrols of</seg><seg type="columnLine">giants, and were arranged in a series of quad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rangles. Within one quadrangle'was a pool which</seg><seg type="columnLine">served as an aquarium; in another, aviaries and</seg><seg type="columnLine">great hen-houses; in yet another, cages with vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous animals; in the fourth a little botanic garden.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Behind were stables with dozens of cattle and sheep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a sort of experimental ward for human beings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took me into the nearest of the buildings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This," he said, "is known to the people as the Fac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory (it is difficult to give the exact sense of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, but it literally means producing-place), the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Factory of Kingship or Majesty, and the Wellspring</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ancestral Immortality." I looked round, and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">platoons of buxom and shining African women, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comingly but unusually dressed in tight-fitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">white dresses and caps, and wearing rubber gloves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Microscopes were much in evidence, as also various</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">receptacles from which steam was emerging. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of the room was screened off by a wooden</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen in which were a series of glass doors; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">these doors opened into partitions, each labelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a name in that unknown tongue, and each con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining a number of objects like the one I had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken out of the basket by the giant before we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">captured. Pipes surrounded this chamber, and ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to be distributing heat from a fire in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Factory of Majesty!" I exclaimed. "Wellspring</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Immortality! What the dickens do you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you prefer a more prosaic name," said Has-</seg><seg type="columnLine">combe, "I should call this the Institute of Religious</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tissue Culture." My mind went back to a day in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1918 when I had been taken by a biological friend in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York to see the famous Rockefeller Institute;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at the word tissue culture I saw again before</seg><seg type="columnLine">me Dr. Alexis Carrell and troops of white-garbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">American girls making cultures, sterilizing, micro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scopizing, incubating and the rest of it. The Has-</seg><seg type="columnLine">combe Institute was, it is true, not so well equipped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it had an even larger, if differently colored, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonnel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hascombe began his explanations. "As you prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably know, Frazer's 'Golden Bough'* introduced us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the idea of a sacred priest-king, and showed how</seg><seg type="columnLine">fundamental it was in primitive societies. The wel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fare of the tribe is regarded as inextricably bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with that of the King, and extraordinary pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautions are taken to preserve him from harm. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">this kingdom, in the old days, the King was hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed to set his foot to the ground in case he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should lose divinity; his cut hair and nail-parings</seg><seg type="columnLine">were entrusted to one of the most important officials</seg><seg type="columnLine">of state, whose duty it was to bury them secretly, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">case some enemy should compass the King's illness</seg><seg type="columnLine">or death by using them in black magic rites. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone of base blood trod on the King's shadow, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid the penalty with his life. Each year a slave</seg><seg type="columnLine">was made mock-king for a week, allowed to enjoy</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the king's privileges, and was decapitated at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">close of his brief glory; and by this means it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed that the illnesses and misfortunes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might befall the King were vicariously got rid of.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I first of all rigged up my apparatus, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aid of Aggers, succeeded in getting good cul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, first of chick tissues and later, by the aid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">embryo-extract, of various adult mammalian tissues.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I then went to Bugala, and told him that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">increase the safety, if not of the King as an indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vidual, at least of the life which was in him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I presumed that this would be equally satisfac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory from a theological point of view. I pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out that if he chose to be made guardian of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">King's subsidiary lives, he would be in a much more</seg><seg type="columnLine">important position than the chamberlain or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">burier of the sacred nail-parings, and might make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the post the most influential in the realm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eventually I was allowed (under threats of death</seg><seg type="columnLine">if anything untoward occurred) to remove small</seg><seg type="columnLine">portions of His Majesty's subcutaneous connective</seg><seg type="columnLine">tissue under a local anaesthetic. In the presence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the assembled nobility I put fragments of this into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">*A very elaborate treatise on a division of Roman mythol-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ogy, especially on the cult of Diana.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE TISSUE-CULTURE KING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">455</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">culture medium, and showed it them under the mi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">croscope. The cultures were then put away in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">incubator, under a guard--relieved every eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours--of half a dozen warriors. After three days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my joy they had all taken and showed abundant</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth. I could see that the Council was impressed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reeled off a magnificent speech, pointing out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this growth constituted an actual increase in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quantity of the divine principle inherent in roy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alty; and, what was more, that I could increase it</seg><seg type="columnLine">indefinitely. With that I cut each of my cultures</seg><seg type="columnLine">into eight, and sub-cultured all the pieces. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were again put under guard, and again examined</seg><seg type="columnLine">after three days. Not all of them had taken this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, and there were some murmurings and angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks, on the ground that I had killed some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">King; but I pointed out that the King was still the</seg><seg type="columnLine">King, that his little wound had completely healed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that any successful cultures represented so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much extra sacredness and protection to the state.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 must say that they were very reasonable, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">good theological acumen, for they at once took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I pointed out to Bugala, and he persuaded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest without much difficulty, that they could now</seg><seg type="columnLine">disregard some of the older implications of the doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trines of kingship. The most important new idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I was able to introduce was mass-production.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our aim was to multiply the King's tissues indefi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nitely, to ensure that some of their protecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">power should reside everywhere in the country.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus by concentrating upon quantity, we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">afford to remove some of the restrictions upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">King's mode of life. This was of course agreeable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the King; and also to Bugala, who saw himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">wielding undreamt-of power. One might have sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed that such an innovation would have met with</seg><seg type="columnLine">great resistance simply on account of its being an</seg><seg type="columnLine">innovation; but I must admit that these people com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared very favorably with the average business</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in their lack of prejudice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Having thus settled the principle, I had many</seg><seg type="columnLine">debates with Bugala as to the best methods for en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">listing the mass of the population in our scheme.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What an opportunity for scientific advertising!</seg><seg type="columnLine">But. unfortunately, the population could not read.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, war propaganda worked very well in more</seg><seg type="columnLine">or less illiterate countries--why not here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HASCOMBE organized a series of public lectures</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the capital, at which he demonstrated his</seg><seg type="columnLine">regal tissues to the multitude, who were bidden to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place by royal heralds. An impressive platform</seg><seg type="columnLine">group was always supplied from the ranks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobles. The lecturer explained how important it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was for the community to become possessed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater and greater stores of the sacred tissues.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unfortunately, the preparation was laborious and</seg><seg type="columnLine">expensive, and it behopved them all to lend a hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had accordingly been arranged that to everyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">subscribing a cow or buffalo, or its equivalent--</seg><seg type="columnLine">three goats, pigs, or sheep--a portion of the royal</seg><seg type="columnLine">anatomy should be given, handsomely mounted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ebony holder. Sub-culturing would be done at</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain hours and days, and it would be obligatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">to send the cultures for renewal. If through any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">negligence the tissue died, no renewal would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">made. The subscription entitled the receiver to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sub-culturing rights for a year, but was of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">renewable. By this means not only would the to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tality of the King be much increased, to the benefit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all, but each cultureholder would possess an ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tual part of His Majesty, and would have the infi</seg><seg type="columnLine">nite joy and privilege of aiding by his own efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">the multiplication of divinity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they could also serve their country by dedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cating a daughter to the state. These young women</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be housed and fed by the state, and taught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the technique of the sacred culture. Candidates</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be selected according to general fitness, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">would of course, in addition, be required to attain</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinction in an examination on the principles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">religion. They would be appointed for a proba</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionary period of six months. After this they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">receive a permanent status, with the title of Sisters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Sacred Tissue. From this, with age, expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rience, and merit, they could expect promotion to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rank of mothers, grandmothers, great grand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mothers, and grand ancestresses of the same. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">merit and benefit they would receive from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">close contact with the source of all benefits would</seg><seg type="columnLine">overflow on to their families.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scheme worked like wildfire. Pigs, goats,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattle, buffaloes, and negro maidens poured in. Next</seg><seg type="columnLine">year the scheme was extended to the whole country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peripatetic laboratory making the rounds weekly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the close of the third year there was hardly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">family in the country which did not possess at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">one sacred culture. To be without one would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been like being without one's trousers--or at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">without one's hat*--on Fifth Avenue. Thus did</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bugala effect a reformation in the national religion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthrone himself as the most important personage</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the country, and entrench applied science and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hascombe firmly in the organization of the state.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Encouraged by his success, Hascombe soon set</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to capture the ancestry-worship branch of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">religion as well. A public proclamation was made</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing out how much more satisfactory it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be if worship could be made not merely to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">charred bones of one's forbears, but to bits of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">still actually living and growing. All who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">desirous of profiting by the enterprise of Bugala's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Department of State should therefore bring their</seg><seg type="columnLine">older relatives to the laboratory at certain specified</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours, and fragments would be painlessly extracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">for culture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This, too, proved very attractive to the average</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizen. Occasionally, it is true, grandfathers or</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged mothers arrived in a state of indignation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">protest. However, this did not matter, since, ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cording to the law, once children were twenty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of age, they were not only assigned the duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of worshipping their ancestors, alive or dead, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">were also given complete control over them, in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all rites might be duly performed to the greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety of the commonweal. Further, the ancestors</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon found that the operation itself was trifling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, what was more, that once accomplished, it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most desirable results.

Each would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken out and reverently examined at the hour of</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayer. "Grandpapa is not growing well this week,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">you would perhaps hear the young black devotee</seg><seg type="columnLine">say; the father of the family would pray over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speck of tissue; and if that failed, it would be taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the factory for rejuvenation. On the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, what rejoicing when a rhythm of activity</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred in the cultures! A spurt on the part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">great-grandmother's tissues would bring her wrin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kled old smile to mind again; and sometimes it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed as if one particular generation were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred simultaneously by a pulse of growth, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">combining to bless their devout descendants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  To deal with the possibility of cultures dying out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hascombe started a central storehouse, where dupli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cates of every strain were kept, and it was this re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pository of the national tissues which had attracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">my attention at the back of the laboratory.

I took advantage of the fact that their</seg><seg type="columnLine">religion holds in reverence monstrous and imbecile</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms of human beings. That is, of course, a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon phenomenon in many countries, where half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wits are supposed to be inspired, and dwarfs the</seg><seg type="columnLine">object of superstitious awe. So I went to work to</seg><seg type="columnLine">create various new types. By employing a particu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar extract of adrenal cortex, I produced children</seg><seg type="columnLine">who would have been a match for the Infant Hercu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">les, and, indeed, looked rather like a cross between</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and a brewer's drayman. By injecting the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">extract into adolescent girls I was able to provide</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with the most copious mustaches, after which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they found ready employment as prophetesses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tampering with the post-pituitary gave remark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able cases of obesity.

Finally, by another pituitary treat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, I at last mastered the secret of true dwarfism,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which perfect proportions are retained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Of these productions, the dwarfs are retained as</seg><seg type="columnLine">acolytes in the temple; a band of the obese young</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladies form a sort of Society of Vestal Virgins, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">special religious duties, which, as the embodiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the national ideal of beauty, they are supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to discharge with peculiarly propitious effect; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giants form our Regular Army.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Obese Virgins have set me a problem which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I confess I have not yet solved. Like all races who</seg><seg type="columnLine">set great store by sexual enjoyment, these people</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a correspondingly exaggerated reverence for</seg><seg type="columnLine">virginity. It therefore occurred to me that if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could apply Jacques Loeb's great discovery of arti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficial parthenogenesis to man, or, to be precise, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">these young ladies, I should be able to grow a race</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vestals, self-reproducing yet ever virgin, to whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">in concentrated form should attach that reverence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which I have just spoken. You see, 1 must al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways remember that it is no good proposing any</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of work that will not benefit the national relig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion.

I have taken the matter a step further than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bataillon with his fatherless frogs, and have in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced parthenogenesis in the eggs of reptiles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds; but so far I have failed with mammals.

"Its official title is 'Home of the Living</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fetishes.'

Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the others, this contained no signs of research</seg><seg type="columnLine">in progress, but was empty. It was draped with</seg><seg type="columnLine">black hangings, and lit only from the top.

Every day I</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a talk with Hascombe, and gradually the talks</seg><seg type="columnLine">became recognized events of our daily routine. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">day I asked if he had given up hope of escaping.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He showed a queer hesitation in replying. Eventu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally he said, "To tell you the truth, my dear Jones,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I have really hardly thought of it these last few</seg><seg type="columnLine">years. It seemed so impossible at first that I delib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erately put it out of my head and turned with more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more energy, I might almost say fury, to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. And now, upon my soul, I am not quite sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether I want to escape or not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not want to!" I exclaimed; "surely you can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am not so sure," he rejoined. "What I most</seg><seg type="columnLine">want is to get ahead with this work of mine. Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, you don't realize what a chance I've got! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is all growing so fast--I can see every kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibility ahead"; and he broke off into silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, although I was interested enough in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">past achievements, I did not feel willing to sacrifice</seg><seg type="columnLine">my future to his perverted intellectual ambitions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he would not leave his work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE experiments which most excited his imagi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation were those he was conducting into mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">telepathy. He had received his medical training</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a time when abnormal psychology was still very</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfashionable in England, but had luckily been</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown in contact with a young doctor who was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen student of hypnotism, through whom he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been introduced to some of the great pioneers, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bramwell and Wingfield. As a result, he had be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come a passable hypnotist himself, with a fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of the literature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the early days of his captivity he became inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested in the sacred dances which took place every</seg><seg type="columnLine">night of full moon, and were regarded as propitia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of the celestial powers. The dancers all be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">long to a special sect. After a series of exciting</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures, symbolizing various activities of the chase,</seg><seg type="columnLine">war, and love, the leader conducts his band to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceremonial bench. He then begins to make passes</seg><seg type="columnLine">at them; and what impressed Hascombe was this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a few seconds sufficed for them to fall back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep hypnosis against the ebony rail. It recalled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, the most startling cases of collective hyp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nosis recorded by the French scientists. The leader</seg><seg type="columnLine">next passed from one end of the bench to the other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispering a brief sentence into each ear. He then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to immemorial rite, approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Priest-King, and, after having exclaimed aloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lord of Majesty, command what thou wilt for thy</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancers to perform," the King would thereupon</seg><seg type="columnLine">command some action which had previously been</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept secret. The command was often to fetch some</seg><seg type="columnLine">object and deposit at the moon-shrine; or to fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enemies of the state; or (and this was what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">company most liked) to be some animal, or bird.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whatever the command, the hypnotized men would</seg><seg type="columnLine">obey it, for the leader's whispered words had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">an order to hear and carry out only what the King</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">said; and the strangest scenes would be witnessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they ran, completely oblivious of all in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">path, in search of the gourds or sheep they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">called on to procure, or lunged in a symbolic way at</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible enemies, or threw themselves on all fours</seg><seg type="columnLine">and roared as lions, or galloped as zebras, or danced</seg><seg type="columnLine">as cranes. The command executed, they stood like</seg><seg type="columnLine">stocks or stones, until their leader, running from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to the other, touched each with a finger and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted "Wake." They woke, and limp, but con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious of having been the vessels of the unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit, danced back to their special hut or club-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This susceptibility to hypnotic suggestion struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hascombe, and he obtained permission to test the</seg><seg type="columnLine">performers more closely. He soon established that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people were, as a race, extremely prone to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sociation, and could be made to lapse into deep hyp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nosis with great ease, but a hypnosis in which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subconscious, though completely cut off from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waking self, comprised portions of the personality</seg><seg type="columnLine">not retained in the hypnotic selves of Europeans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like most who have fluttered round the psychologi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal candle, he had been interested in the notion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">telepathy; and now, with this supply of hypnotic</seg><seg type="columnLine">subjects under his hands, began some real investi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gation of the problem.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  By picking his subjects, he was soon able to dem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onstrate the existence of telepathy, by making sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestions to one hypnotized man who transferred</seg><seg type="columnLine">them without physical intermediation to another at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a distance. Later--and this was the culmination of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his work--he found that when he made a suggestion</seg><seg type="columnLine">to several subjects at once, the telepathic effect was</seg><seg type="columnLine">much stronger than if he had done it to one at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time--the hypnotized minds were reinforcing each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. "I'm after the super-consciousness," Has-</seg><seg type="columnLine">combe said, "and I've already got the rudiments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I must confess that I got almost as excited as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hascombe over the possibilities thus opened up. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly seemed as if he were right in principle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If all the subjects were in practically the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">psychological state, extraordinary reinforcing ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fects were observed. At first the attainment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this similarity of condition was very difficult; grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually, however, we discovered that it was possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tune hypnotic subjects to the same pitch, if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">may use the metaphor, and then the fun really</seg><seg type="columnLine">began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  First of all we found that with increasing rein-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forcement, we could get telepathy conducted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater and greater distances, until finally we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmit commands from the capital to the national</seg><seg type="columnLine">boundary, nearly a hundred miles. We next found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was not necessary for the subject to be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypnosis to receive the telepathic command. Almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody, but especially those of equable tempera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, could thus be influenced. Most extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all, however, were what we at first christened</seg><seg type="columnLine">"near effects," since their transmission to a distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not found possible until later. If, after Has-</seg><seg type="columnLine">combe had suggested some simple command to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">largish group of hypnotized subjects, he or I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">right up among them, we would experience the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">extraordinary sensation, as of some superhuman</seg><seg type="columnLine">personality repeating the command in a menacing</seg><seg type="columnLine">458</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and overwhelming way and, whereas with one part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ourselves we felt that we must carry out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">command, with another we felt, if I may say so, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we were only a part of the command, or of some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing much bigger than ourselves which was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manding. And this, Hascombe claimed, was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first real beginning of the super-consciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bugala, of course, had to be considered. Has-</seg><seg type="columnLine">combe, with the old Tibetan prayer-wheel at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of his mind, suggested that eventually he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be able to induce hypnosis in the whole pop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulation, and then transmit a prayer. This would</seg><seg type="columnLine">ensure that the daily prayer, for instance, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">really said by the whole population, and, what is</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, simultaneously, which would undoubtedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">much enhance its efficacy. And it would make it pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible in times of calamity or battle to keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole praying force of the nation at work for long</seg><seg type="columnLine">spells together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUGALA was deeply interested. He saw himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through this mental machinery, planting such</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas as he wished in the brain-cases of his people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw himself willing an order; and the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">population rousing itself out of trance to execute it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He dreamt dreams before which those of the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prietor of a newspaper syndicate, even those of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">director of propaganda in wartime, would be pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">and timid. Naturally, he wished to receive per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal instruction in the methods himself; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally naturally, we could not refuse him, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must say that I often felt a little uneasy as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he might choose to do if he ever decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">override Hascombe and to start experimenting on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own. This, combined with my constant long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to get away from the place, led me to cast about</seg><seg type="columnLine">again for means of escape. Then it occurred to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this very method about which I had such</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloomy presentiments, might itself be made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">key to our prison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So one day, after getting Hascombe worked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the loss to humanity it would be to let this</seg><seg type="columnLine">great discovery die with him in Africa, I set to in</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnest. "My dear Hascombe," I said, " you must</seg><seg type="columnLine">get home out of this. What is there to prevent you</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying to Bugala that your experiments are nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowned with success, but that for certain tests you</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have a much greater number of subjects at</seg><seg type="columnLine">your disposal? You can then get a battery of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred men, and after you have tuned them, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reinforcement will be so great that you will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">at your disposal a mental force big enough to affect</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole population. Then, of course, one fine day</seg><seg type="columnLine">we should raise the potential of our mind-batterv to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the highest possible level, and send out through it</seg><seg type="columnLine">a general hypnotic influence. The whole country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, women, and children, would sink into stupor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Next we should give our experimental squad the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion to broadcast 'sleep for a week.' The tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathic message would be relayed to each of the thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands of minds waiting receptively for it, and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take root in them, until the whole nation became a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single super-consciousness, conscious only of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thought 'sleep' which we had thrown into it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The reader will perhaps ask how we ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected to escape from the clutches of the super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness we had created. Well, we had dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">covered that metal was relatively impervious to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telepathic effect, and had prepared for ourselves a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of tin pulpit, behind which we could stand while</seg><seg type="columnLine">conducting experiments. This, combined with caps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of metal foil, enormously reduced the effects on our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves. We had not informed Bugala of this prop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erty of metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hascombe was silent. At length he spoke. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the idea, he said; "I like to think that if I ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">do get back to England and to scientific recognition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my discovery will have given me the means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  From that moment we worked assiduously to per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect our method and our plans. After about five</seg><seg type="columnLine">months everything seemed propitious. We had pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visions packed away, and compasses. I had been al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed to keep my rifle, on promise that I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never discharge it. We had made friends with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the men who went trading to the coast, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">got from them all the information we could about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the route, without arousing their suspicions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At last, the night arrived. We assembled our</seg><seg type="columnLine">men as if for an ordinary practice, and after hyp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nosis had been induced, started to tune them. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">this moment Bugala came in, unannounced. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was what we had been afraid of; but there had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">no means of preventing it. "What shall we do?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered to Hascombe, in English. "Go right</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead and be damned to it," was his answer; "we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can put him to sleep with the rest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So we welcomed him, and gave him a seat as near</seg><seg type="columnLine">as possible to the tightly-packed ranks of the per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">'formers. At length the preparations were finished.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hascombe went into the pulpit and said, "Attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the words which are to be suggested." There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a slight stiffening of the bodies. "Sleep!" said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hascombe. "Sleep is the command: command all</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this land to sleep unbrokenly." Bugala leapt up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an exclamation; but the induction had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We with our metal coverings were immune. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bugala was struck by the full force of the mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">current. He sank back on his chair, helpless. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few minutes his extraordinary will resisted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion. Although he could not move, his angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were open. But at length he succumbed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he too slept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We lost no time in starting, and made good prog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ress through the silent country. The people were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting about like wax figures. Women sat asleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">by their milk-pails, the cow by this time far away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fat-bellied naked children slept at their games. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses were full of sleepers sleeping upright round</seg><seg type="columnLine">their food, recalling Wordsworth's famous "party</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a parlor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So we went on, feeling pretty queer and scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">believing in this morphic state into which we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged a nation. Finally the frontier was reached,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where with extreme elation, we passed an immobile</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gigantic frontier guard. A few miles further</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had a good solid meal, and a doze. Our kit was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather heavy, and we decided to jettison some super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluous weight, in the shape of some food, specimens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and our metal headgear, or mind-protectors, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this distance, and with the hypnosis wearing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little thin, were, we thought, no longer necessary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE TISSUE-CULTURE KING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">459</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     About nightfall on the third day, Hascombe sud-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   denly stopped and turned his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     ''What's the matter?" I said, "Have you seen a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   lion?" His reply was completely unexpected. "No.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I was just wondering whether really I ought not to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   go back again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     "Go back again," I cried. "What in the name of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   God Almighty do you want to do that for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     "It suddenly struck me that I ought to," he said,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "about five minutes ago. And really, when one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   comes to think of it, I don't suppose I shall ever</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   get such a chance at research again. What's more,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   this is a dangerous journey to the coast, and I don't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   expect we shall get through alive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     I was thoroughly upset and put out, and told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. And suddenly, for a few moments, I felt I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">) go back too. It was like that old friend of our boy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood, the voice of conscience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     "Yes, to be sure, we ought to go back," I thought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   with fervor. But suddenly checking myself as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   thought came under the play of reason--"Why</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   should we go back?" All sorts of reasons were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   proffered, as it were by unseen hands reaching up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   out of the hidden parts of me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">immovable. He must go back; he knew it; he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">it clearly; it was his sacred duty; and much other</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar rubbish. All this time the suggestion was</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacking me too; and finally I felt that if I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">put more distance between me and that unisonic</seg><seg type="columnLine">battery of will, I should succumb as well as he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hascombe," I said, "I am going on. For God's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake, come with me." And I shouldered my pack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and set off. He was shaken, I saw, and came a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps after me. But finally he turned, and, in spite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my frequent pauses and shouts to him to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">made off in the direction we had come. I can assure</seg><seg type="columnLine">you that it was with a gloomy soul that I continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">my solitary way. I shall not bore you with my ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventures. Suffice it to say that at last I got to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white outpost, weak with fatigue and poor food and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I kept very quiet about my adventures, only giv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out that our expedition had lost its way and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my men had run away or been killed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">local tribes. At last I reached England. But I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a broken man, and a profound gloom had invaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind at the thought of Hascombe and the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been caught in his own net. I never found</seg><seg type="columnLine">out what happened to him, and I do not suppose that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am likely to find out now. You may ask why 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not try to organize a rescue expedition; or why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least, I did not bring Hascombe's discoveries be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the Royal Society or the Metaphysical Insti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tute. I can only repeat that I was a broken man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not expect to be believed; I was not at all sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I could repeat our results, even on the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">human material, much less with men of another</seg><seg type="columnLine">race; I dreaded ridicule; and finally I was tormented</seg><seg type="columnLine">by doubts as to whether the knowledge of mass-tel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">epathy would not be a curse rather than a blessing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to mankind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, I am an oldish man now and, what is</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, old for my years. I want to get the story off</seg><seg type="columnLine">my chest. Besides, old men like sermonizing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you must forgive, gentle reader, the sermonical turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I now feel I must take. The question 1 want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to raise is this: Dr. Hascombe attained to an unsur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed power in a number of the applications of</seg><seg type="columnLine">science--but to what end did all this power serve?</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is the merest cant and twaddle to go on asserting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as most of our press and people continue to do, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">increase of scientific knowledge and power must in</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself be good. I commend to the great public the</seg><seg type="columnLine">obvious moral of my story and ask them to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they propose to do with the power which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually being accumulated for them by the labors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those who labor because they like power, or be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause they want to find the truth about how things</seg><seg type="columnLine">work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   AND then I realized what had happened. Bugala</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   had waked up; he had wiped out the suggestion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   we had given to the super-consciousness, and in its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   place put in another. I could see him thinking it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   out, the cunning devil (one must give him credit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   for brains!), and hear him, after making his passes,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   whisper to the nation in prescribed form his new</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   suggestion: "Will to return!" "Return!" For most</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   of the inhabitants the command would have no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   meaning, for they would have been already at home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Doubtless some young men out on the hills, or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   truant children, or girls run off in secret to meet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   their lovers, were even now returning, stiffly and in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   somnambulistic trance, to their homes. It was only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   for them that the new command of the super-con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   sciousness had any meaning--and for us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     I am putting it in a long and discursive way; at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   the moment I simply saw what had happened in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   flash. I told Hascombe, I showed him it must be so,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   that nothing else would account for the sudden</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   change, I begged and implored him to use his rea-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   son, to stick to his decision and to come on. How</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I regretted that, in our desire to discard all useless</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   weight, we had left behind our metal telepathy-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   proof head coverings!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     But Hascombe would not, or could not, see my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   point.

The whole structure was of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">seamless piece, unbroken save where the manhole</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave access to its interior. Four massive, equally</seg><seg type="columnLine">spaced spokes, or ribs, radiated out from the cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, the object of these being to prevent the cylin</seg><seg type="columnLine">der rolling over as the soil subsided.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel wiring was "Electro re-tempered" by a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">process, which increased its tensile strength one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred fold; while the copper was first tempered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the re-discovered process which for centuries</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a "lost art," and then "Electro re-tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered" the same as the steel. So that, while of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gossamer-like delicacy in appearance, the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus was in fact much stronger than the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">styles. Both sets were permanently adjusted to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicately-complicated, alternating "E.V.R.-X.Y.Z."</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavelength, which the makers believed proof</seg><seg type="columnLine">against duplication, and which they guaranteed</seg><seg type="columnLine">against static within a radius of 10,000 miles under</seg><seg type="columnLine">any possible conditions. The cover of the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">receptacle of his own set was in shape a gold shield,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a "spread-eagle" engraved rampant upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">South Sea Island golden-sunset field 011 its face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was liable to be mistaken, by its appearance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a decoration of European royalty; and Es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meralda had agreed with him that it was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">nifty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But hers was contained in the back of a "veri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin" wrist watch, and that was where the trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">started.

And, growing sarcastic towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last, he had admitted that that portion of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">anatomy did need some kind of covering: but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had denied the efficacy of the "lavalliere" idea for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that special purpose. He had contended that both</seg><seg type="columnLine">the d6collett6 in the front and the "open-back" fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures of her gowns, should stop at the "lines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">curvature." He had even launched into a general</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirade against a number of her recent costumes, -</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had called them "picture-frame" conceptions;</seg><seg type="columnLine">because "they performed a similar function," in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that "they merely furnished the setting for empha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sizing the details of the things revealed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That, as he had believed, had settled their argu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment!

The best that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be said for its shape was that it looked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gigantic beer bottle.

Moreover, his discovery was made</seg><seg type="columnLine">recently--within the past three years in fact, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">more astonishing yet, the secret has been forever</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost to the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now that the man responsible for the results can</seg><seg type="columnLine">never repeat his performance, and has left no de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tailed explanation of the means whereby the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditions were brought about, there is no reason why</seg><seg type="columnLine">an account of the whole matter should not be pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Undoubtedly many of my readers will recollect</seg><seg type="columnLine">the excitement caused by the inexplicable disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance of Doctor Elias Henderson, the well known</seg><seg type="columnLine">and prominent biologist of McCracken College.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Probably, too, it will also be remembered that, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most coincidentally with his disappearance, a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of the University students vanished, as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">two private citizens and a physician.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a great many more or less conflicting accounts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were published in the newspapers o' 'he time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as many of these were far from accurate, it may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">well to give a brief resumg of the events, for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange as it may seem,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disappearance, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a time supplied head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line material for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">press, had a very direct</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing upon the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery of perpetual youth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or rather, I might say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the discovery had a direct</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing upon the disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The facts in the case</seg><seg type="columnLine">were simple and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">well established. Five</seg><seg type="columnLine">students, two private citizens, an instructor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a female doctor, together with Doctor Hen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derson, completely vanished without any ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent or determinable reason. The investigations</seg><seg type="columnLine">which followed, and which oddly enough were only</seg><seg type="columnLine">instituted after the disappearance of Doctor Hen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derson, revealed the fact that the ten missing per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons had been absent from their accustomed haunts</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some days before they had been missed. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">also established that all had been very friendly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had frequently met, apparently in secret,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the other nine had made periodical visits</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Dr. Henderson's laboratory. This, however, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not strange, as it was well known that all, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exception of the two citizens--one a merchant and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other a banker--had been taking courses in biol-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ogy from Dr. Henderson. It was therefore assumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the meetings referred to were in the nature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">purely scientific affairs, although why the unscien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific merchant and banker should have been present,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or should have visited Dr. Henderson's laboratory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a mystery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had Dr. Henderson not vanished, it is highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">probable that he would have been suspected of mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing away with the others, but as he, too, had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, any such theory was of course discarded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was also determined that not one of the ten had</seg><seg type="columnLine">any apparent reason for vanishing; not one was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">debt or involved in any scandal, and no one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance any reasonable theory for any person wish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to murder them, for with the exception of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banker and merchant, all were persons of very mod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erate means, while the banker and merchant were</seg><seg type="columnLine">known never to carry large sums of money on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">persons, but conducted practically all of their busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness by means of checks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FINALLY, and making the case even more baf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fling, the garments of all the ten were found</seg><seg type="columnLine">intact though carelessly tossed aside. The students'</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes were found in their several rooms, the gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of the merchant and banker were discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their private offices, the lady physician's gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments were in her office, and Doctor Henderson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">street clothes were found in a corner of his labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory. No one who was questioned, and hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">persons were examined, could definitely swear as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they had last seen the missing persons, and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">one witness could be located who was positive as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last person seen with any of the missing people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Henderson was a rather retiring, secretive</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and frequently slept on a cot in his laboratory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as no one really knew when he had vanished, no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one could remember hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing seen any stranger or</seg><seg type="columnLine">other person with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he was last seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The janitor of the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, after striving his</seg><seg type="columnLine">best to revisualize the</seg><seg type="columnLine">events of the past few</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks, stated that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the impression that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seen a young man</seg><seg type="columnLine">-- a youth of fifteen or</seg><seg type="columnLine">thereabouts, entering and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the doctor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory on several occasions, but he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be sure whether or not he had ever seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scientist in the young fellow's company. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">servant at the home of Dr. Elvira Flagg, also</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hazy in her memory, although she, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared that she had noticed a young man, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a girl of about the same age, who frequently entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left the office; but whether in company with Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flagg she was not sure. As the office boys of both</seg><seg type="columnLine">the merchant and banker also remembered seeing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth make frequent visits to their employers the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police at once began a search for a stripling an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swering the rather vague descriptions of the several</seg><seg type="columnLine">witnesses. No trace of such a person could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found, but, to their surprise and confusion, the gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of such a young fellow were found in a closet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">JLfODERN science is deeply immersed in experiments</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to bring forlli the Elixir of Youth.

Our author, in his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deft and original manner, images a gas which will prove</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Elixir of Life. That his experiments exceeded his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wildest expectations and proved an Ultra-Elixir and a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">disaster to all concerned, only makes the story more com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plicated and absorbing. It is a picturesque tale of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">biological possibilities in the field of modern science.</seg><seg type="columnLine">478</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in Dr. Henderson's room, in the suite occupied by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the merchant, and in the hotel apartments of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banker. Nothing further was discovered, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire affair was given up as an unsolvable mystery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">During the investigation however, evidences were</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered which tended to show that several other</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hitherto unsuspected crimes had been committed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the missing parties. Just what these were, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">authorities have never disclosed, but according to</seg><seg type="columnLine">persistent rumor they were in the nature of infan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tile crimes. Gossip had it that persons had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioned who insisted that they had heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cries of infants issuing from Dr. Henderson's lab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oratory, that no children had ever come forth, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was their belief that the scientist and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends had sacrificed the infants in some experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments or had actually subjected them to vivisection.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hence, in the minds of many persons, the missing</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten had had good reason to disappear, being, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">these worthies argued, fugitives from justice and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the wrath of the public. Indeed, ru&amp;or and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gossip soon linked the names of the ten as members</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some secret and horrible cult with human sacri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fices and what not. And the action of the police in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hushing up the matter and abandoning all efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">to solve the mystery, only confirmed these ugly ru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mors in the minds of many.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But like all other mysteries and scandals, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter soon lost interest, and within a twelvemonth</seg><seg type="columnLine">was practically forgotten. Thus matters stood when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I received a letter from the regents of McCracken</seg><seg type="columnLine">College in which I was offered the position of Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor of Biology left vacant by the disappearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Dr. Henderson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ordinarily, I think, I would have declined, for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had an excellent position, and while the salary at</seg><seg type="columnLine">McCracken was larger than that which I was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiving, yet it did not offer the scope_ in research</seg><seg type="columnLine">work which I desired, and as I had a" fairly good</seg><seg type="columnLine">income of my own, the salary was not so important.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But remembering the mystery which had surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed the former biologist's disappearance, and having</seg><seg type="columnLine">been well acquainted with Dr. Henderson when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were students together at Belmore, the offer some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how appealed to me, because for some inexplicable</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason, I had a feeling that I might be able to solve</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mystery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I therefore accepted the position, and, a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks later, found myself in possession of Dr. Hen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derson's laboratory, instruments, notes and appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atus. I had in fact almost literally stepped into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes. I am not superstitious and am not nervous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I have never been subject to hallucinations or</seg><seg type="columnLine">to any sensations for which I cannot account upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific or medical grounds. But from the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I took charge of Dr. Henderson's work and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory I had the strange and wholly unaccount-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able feeling of being in the presence of others, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">being constantly watched. At times this sensation</seg><seg type="columnLine">became almost unbearable. Several times I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself involuntarily stepping aside as if to avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepping upon or bumping into someone, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room was empty, and once or twice I actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">started and shivered as I seemed to feel hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching my limbs or body. It was, of course, ridic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulous. I was no believer in ghosts or spirits, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I decided that it was merely a psychological matter,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a reaction of my nervous system to the atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mystery which pervaded the place. Hence, 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed at my own sensations, called upon my su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perior mentality to govern my subjective nerves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and proceeded with my work, but throughout my</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay in the laboratory--which was, I must confess,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of short duration--I never overcame the decidedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncomfortable feelings which I have mentioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My first act upon taking possession of Dr. Hen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derson's apparatus and laboratory was to combine</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thorough search of the premises with an equally</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorough housecleaning. Dr. Henderson, like so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many scientific men, was unfortunately far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">orderly or neat. Instruments, books, papers, appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atus, formute and chemicals had been left in dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">array, evidently having been left wherever the biol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ogist had used them last; drawers and cupboards</seg><seg type="columnLine">were piled full of a hodge-podge of odds and ends;</seg><seg type="columnLine">soiled laboratory aprons; old shoes and dirty towels</seg><seg type="columnLine">were tucked away here and there, and as I cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the place I wondered how the police could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a thorough search of the room under the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isting conditions. And it was soon evident that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not. Among a pile of old magazines, discarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">litmus paper, and other rubbish in a closet I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a find which, temporarily at least, completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked me out. This was in fact a bundle of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fant's garments, rather mussed and soiled and evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently worn. For a space I sat, gazing at the tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">garments with a strange mingling of horror, dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">may, amazement and wonder. Had the ugly rumors</seg><seg type="columnLine">been true after all? Had my old classmate gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad with his researches and had he actually sacri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficed an innocent child on the altar of science? If</seg><seg type="columnLine">not why should he have been in possession of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">garments? Where were the remains of the child</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself? And what had been his relations with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others who had vanished? What terrible things</seg><seg type="columnLine">had occurred to cause them all to disappear? Surely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought, no matter what events had led up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">culminating destruction the child, Dr. Hender-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son must have made notes of it somewhere. What-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever he had done had beyond doubt been done in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistaken, a warped idea that it was in the cause of</seg><seg type="columnLine">science; that the means would be justified by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end; and hence he would have been certain to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">recorded his theories, or the results of his experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments. To solve the mystery I must find such notes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, abandoning all other work, I sought diligently</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feverishly for some note book, some pad or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">some scrap of paper which might explain every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, I realized, there was a possibility, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strong chance that he had destroyed the notes or</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken them with him. The very fact that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had disappeared, together with the others who I no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer doubted had been implicated with him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crime, proved that they realized the enormity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their deeds and hence would have destroyed any evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence or records. But the fact that the garments</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been left so carelessly about caused me to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that more conclusive proofs might also have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">overlooked. Moreover, Dr. Henderson, as I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered already, was extremely absent-minded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary matters, and he also had had a habit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jotting down notes on anything and everything that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to hand. Hence, I reasoned, even if he or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ULTRA-ELIXIR OF YOUTH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">479</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">others had made away with the most important evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dences, there was more than an even chance that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had overlooked or had completely forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">stray notes which would throw light on the matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was slow work, studying the almost hierogly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phic-like writing of my predecessor and examining</seg><seg type="columnLine">every scrap of paper, even the margins of leaves in</seg><seg type="columnLine">books and pamphlets, for what I sought. And for</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours my efforts were fruitless. At last, when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had almost abandoned hope, I opened a small drawer</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a littered and dust-covered desk and made a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond and most surprising discovery. The drawer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with the strangest collection of objects which</seg><seg type="columnLine">could possibly be imagined in the laboratory of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist. There were infants' garments, bottles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared foods, a nursing bottle, safety pins, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattle, various other objects requisite to the well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fare of small children, and, what seemed to me most</seg><seg type="columnLine">important of all, a square, rather thick book which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately I opened it I discovered was a diary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here, if anywhere, I felt, lay the solution of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysteries. The first entry was dated over three</seg><seg type="columnLine">years back, but a short perusal of the pages proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the diary had not been kept regularly or con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">secutively, and that for long periods, no dates had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been entered. It was, in fact, more of a journal or</seg><seg type="columnLine">note book than a diary, and almost feverishly I</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the pages, glancing only at the occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">dates, and to my delight found that the last dated</seg><seg type="columnLine">entry was September 14th, of the current year,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a few days before the disappearance of Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson had been made known. Beyond ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, then, there would be references to the myste-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rious events, and turning back the pages, I set my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to the task of reading the vojume page by page.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND as I did so I became more and more as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tounded at what I found, for the indisputable</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence of Dr. Henderson's writing proved that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vanished biologist, whose whole life had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoted to science and proven facts, had believed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wholly unscientific and preposterous dream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">perpetual youth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see no scientific reason why organic matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">should deteriorate with age," he had written in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">entry. "Age, in animals or plants, is merely the</seg><seg type="columnLine">decay of certain tissues or cells brought about by</seg><seg type="columnLine">various causes, most of which are unnatural, arti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficial or due to the abuse of nature's laws. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked with E. on the subject, and she agrees with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. If we admit Einstein's theory of relativity</seg><seg type="columnLine">then age is merely relative--in the universal scheme</seg><seg type="columnLine">of things the infant is as old as the senile centenar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ian or vice-versa. Biologically there is no such</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing as old age. Growth, yes; the building up of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tissues by cells, yes; but the healthy, normal cell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aged plant or animal is indistinguishable from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corresponding cell of the new-born infant or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seedling plant. Scientifically endless youth or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arresting of cellular decay may be impossible, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">so many known facts refute scientific possibilities</seg><seg type="columnLine">that 1 am beginning to lose faith in scientific laws."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little later I came upon the following: "I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously sounded my class by dwelling lightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the matter of arresting decay and producing</seg><seg type="columnLine">so-called perpetual youth. I judge several of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young men were intensely interested as, after the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lecture, they remained and plied me with many ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. The subject opens up endless vistas. If the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking down of cellular tissues were possible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">death could be averted, except by accident, and prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tical immortality could be achieved. And what tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous accomplishments might be achieved by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist, an artist, any intellectual man, if he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured of a virile, healthy existence for hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of years; if for a century or more he retained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy, the brain power, the physical and organic</seg><seg type="columnLine">status of the prime of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe this might be accomplished. E. (I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">already assumed that Dr. Elvira Flagg was the E.</seg><seg type="columnLine">referred to) is as greatly interested in the subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">as myself. In her practice she has opportunities to</seg><seg type="columnLine">study living beings in all stages of cellular decay or</seg><seg type="columnLine">age, and with physical and mental powers breaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">down through various causes. Her observations are</seg><seg type="columnLine">as valuable to me as are my biological experiments</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her. Several of my young men are also vastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested and we often discuss the matter together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps the time has not yet arrived when man can</seg><seg type="columnLine">choose the age or physical state in which he elects</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remain, but some day it will be as ordinary an</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair as to select one's food or method of convey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For several pages after this last entry Dr. Hen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derson's diary omitted all reference to the subject,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I began to think that his observations had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly theoretical, and that he had not seriously</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered the matter. But in this I was grossly</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistaken, for once again the subject was the sole</seg><seg type="columnLine">topic of the notes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe that we are on the way to solving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem of arresting the deterioration of organic</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter when caused by the lapse of time," he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">written. "A regrettable accident has indicated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">path we should follow. Several weeks ago the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">airship Colossus was destroyed by an explosion</seg><seg type="columnLine">when passing over the village of Emerson. One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my young men who resides in the vicinity of Emer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son mentioned a most curious and interesting phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomenon which has occurred where the accident</seg><seg type="columnLine">took place. The health of the residents has greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">improved; several of the aged inmates of the County</seg><seg type="columnLine">Home have recovered full use of their limbs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyesight, and some ancient and dying trees have</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown unusual and most astonishing growth--put-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting out new shoots and fresh leaves.

Could we only obtain a small amount of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas we might make astounding discoveries."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was now as deeply interested in Dr. Henderson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">records as he had been in his visionary dream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">perpetual youth. The destruction of the Colosstis</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still fresh in my mind; it had been a nation-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide sensation, for the explosion, the cause of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never been found, had utterly destroyed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire crew of the immense craft. Neither could I</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt the truth of Dr. Henderson's statements re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garding the conditions which had followed the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aster. But, I reasoned, this might have been due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to perfectly normal and easily explained causes</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the biologist in his enthusiasm had overlook-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed. Was it not quite possible that the gas, or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">compounds arising from its explosion, had acted as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fertilizer and had thus caused a sudden spurt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vegetable growth about Emerson? And was it not</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally possible, and even reasonable, to suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the disaster, the excitement attendant upon it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the shock of the explosion had caused a nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhilaration or had acted as a stimulant to the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitants, especially to the aged members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">community, which would, temporarily, give them</seg><seg type="columnLine">new vigor and a false rejuvenation? Yes, unques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionably such was the rase, for, I reasoned, had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effects been lasting, had there been any marked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual results from the explosion of the airship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the press would most certainly have gotten hold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SUCH thoughts raced through my brain as I pe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rused the succeeding pages of my predecessor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">journal, until once again, I found myself fascinated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the record.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "E. has solved one of the obstacles," it began.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Among her patients is a Mr. Burke, a wealthy mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chant who is under a deep obligation to her.

But what I found exceeded my wild-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est dreams and fascinated, astounded, fairly trem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling with excitement, I read the wholly incredible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet indisputably true story of the most amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">events ever transcribed by human hands; a story</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, omitting the dates and irrevelant entries,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran as follows:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Montross has succeeded. He has separated over</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty hitherto unknown chemicals from the QW</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas. Among these is an entirely new element which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has named Juvenum and which he believes holds</seg><seg type="columnLine">the key to our success. Even if we fail, the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery of this element will make him famous. Burke</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Redfield are fairly crazy over the work. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter has put his entire fortune at our disposal. E.</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been untiring, and as soon as our labors are</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowned with success or we are convinced of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">futility of further investigations I shall make her</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wife. If we succeed, the vista before us is too</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous to realize; endless years of perpetual</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth together; never to grow old, never to lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">the freshness and beauty of her full womanhood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">never to lose my vigor, my intellect, my enthusiasm!</seg><seg type="columnLine">But we have all agreed not to keep the knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our success from the world. We have argued</seg><seg type="columnLine">at length on this. Burke and Redfield were at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">all for retaining the secret. Burke saw a marvelous</seg><seg type="columnLine">money-making opportunity in it, treating persons</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fabulous sums--millionaires he stated would pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything to retain their youth, while Redfield ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gued that if no one grew old the world would soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">be overcrowded and dire results would follow. E.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">h*wever, pointed out that even if we could prevent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ravages of time we might not and probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be able to prevent the ravages of diseases</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor fatalities through accidents and that, youth</seg><seg type="columnLine">being more impulsive and reckless than maturity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the percentage of accidents and disease would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater, while many persons would not care to avail</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves of the treatment. Montross also pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out that the benefits derived by scientists and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">intellectuals being able to carry on indefinitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">would more than offset any dangers of overpopula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and that, unquestionably, these men with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">discoveries would be able to solve any such problems</seg><seg type="columnLine">which might arise. He himself, he stated, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">devote his entire life to producing artificial foods,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus reducing the areas essential to growing crops</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rendering more space available for industries</seg><seg type="columnLine">and housing. For my own part, T declared that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be extremely selfish to retain the secret, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we would, I felt sure, be heartily sick of youth</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we found ourselves still young while all our</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends and acquaintances were aging and our asso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciates through decades were to be yet unborn gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erations. We have also discussed the question of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our discovery producing immortality. None of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe this will be possible, and I do not think any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us believe it desirabe. Burke is a devout Roman</seg><seg type="columnLine">Catholic: Redfield is a pillar of the Episcopal</seg><seg type="columnLine">church; E. is very religious and a member of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Methodist church; Montross is an Episcopalian and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">while I profess no particular religion I am a firm</seg><seg type="columnLine">believer in the omnipotence of the Creator and His</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisdom. I believe, too, in a future existence of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort, and neither the others nor myself would wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">to forego the chances of such a state. Moreover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of us, with the possible exception of some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my young and ultra-modern students, believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">man has the power to change the laws of Nature or</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accomplish anything in opposition to the will of</seg><seg type="columnLine">God. To prevent the visual ravages of time upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the system would, we all agree, be no violation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nature's inexorable laws, whereas immortality</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be in direct opposition to the entire scheme</seg><seg type="columnLine">of things. To increase the span of life, and to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain the faculties of youth during that life, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a blessing, but to live on forever would be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curse. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have carried on very extensive tests with va-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rious organisms, both vegetable and animal. We find</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, as Montross expected, the new element Juvc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">num is the active principle, but we have met with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexpected obstacle. While the lower forms of life</seg><seg type="columnLine">respond to the treatment and become rejuvenated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or do not age, yet they soon cease to function or die.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What a calamity it would be if man, in his desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">for youth, should be compelled to shorten his exist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence, to flit, like a butterfly, for a brief space and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then die while in the possession of the youth he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought! Perhaps, after all, our lives as they are,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are preferable; perhaps old age has its advantages.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, we feel that the trouble is not insurmount-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, that by experimenting we can produce the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desired effects without the unfortunate results. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">C£'\X/'E have hit it! Purely by accident we--for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">' ' must give credit to my assistants, and espe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cially to Burke who is the last man in the world one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would expect to make a discovery--purely by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">accident, I say, we have solved the problem. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">while away the time, Burke brought a radio receiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing set to the laboratory. One of the receptacles</seg><seg type="columnLine">containing the organisms treated with Juvenum</seg><seg type="columnLine">was close to the set, and whereas all other treated</seg><seg type="columnLine">organisms died after a few days, those beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio set continued to live and thrive with remark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able vigor. Burke, oddly enough, was the first to</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice it, and called our attention to it. Johnson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of my students, is a radio enthusiast and pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sesses an intimate knowledge of the apparatus. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared that the electro-magnetic waves, or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrons from the tubes, must have been instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental in producing the results, and we at once pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded to experiment along these lines. Unques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionably Johnson was right. Organisms, both ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal and vegetable, exposed to the vacuum tubes'</seg><seg type="columnLine">action and treated with Juvenum become rejuve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated and thrive prodigiously, whereas others sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilarly treated, but kept from the tubes' influence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">expire rapidly. The question now is, do the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">juvenated organisms retain their vigor and condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion after a certain duration of exposure to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes or is the action of the radio energy essential</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order for them to exist? . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perpetual youth is within our grasp! Once or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ganisms are treated with Juvenum and subjected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the vacuum tubes' action, they retain their vigor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and continue to live without aging. We now have</seg><seg type="columnLine">482</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a number which for several weeks have remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">unchanged, yet which, under normal conditions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have died of old age long ago. We are now</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to test our methods upon higher forms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. Tomorrow we shall treat rabbits and guinea</seg><seg type="columnLine">pigs, some potted plants and some birds. Montross</seg><seg type="columnLine">has an ancient toothless dog of which he is very</seg><seg type="columnLine">fond, but which he must destroy very soon. He is</seg><seg type="columnLine">to try the effect of our treatment upon the beast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">E. has offered a parrot which has been for many</seg><seg type="columnLine">years in her family and which shows evidences of</seg><seg type="columnLine">extreme age. Johnson facetiously offered to steal</seg><seg type="columnLine">a decrepit cab horse and bring the creature to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory, while Burke declared the best subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be our octogenarian state senator, and Red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field suggested that we try the treatment on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">local trolley line. We are all so elated that such</seg><seg type="columnLine">nonsense is forgivable, and we are all terribly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnest and are under such a nerve strain that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">must find an outlet, for our feelings. That we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the verge of proving the epochal discovery we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made, 1 am convinced, for microscopic exam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inations of the cells and tissues which I have pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared show undeniable proofs of marvelous rejuve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation and increased vigor and resistance. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We cannot believe our senses. Every experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment has been a tremendous success. Three days</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago Montross's dog was a miserable half-blind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">toothless thing and today he is frisking about like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a puppy; he can see almost as well as ever and</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth are sprouting from his gums. E.'s ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">parrot is gay with the plumage of a young bird,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he talks and chatters constantly, and climbs about</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an acrobat. So marvelous were the results</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Burke, Redfield, Johnson and several of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others insisted on taking the treatment despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">my advice, for I fear there are possibilities which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we did not foresee and which may not be alto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether desirable. I had sought for means of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining youth, but our discovery goes beyond that</seg><seg type="columnLine">and restores youth. In all probability further re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">searches and experiments will enable us to ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minister a treatment in such a manner that almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">any desired condition of maturity may be attained</seg><seg type="columnLine">and permanently fixed, but at present we cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sure how much of age will be wiped away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">how much of youthfulness will be restored. Earn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">estly I pointed out to Burke and Redfield that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be far from desirable or pleasant if, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking a treatment, they should be transformed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">beardless boys, irresponsible youngsters whom no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one would recognize. But they were adamant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They argued that by taking a light treatment they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could test, out the powers of the Juvenum, that as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had made the experiments possible they</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be entitled to be the first to test the effects</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the discovery, and that they hadn't the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of its restoring too much of their past youth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnson and the others sided with them, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last, realizing, I fear a bit selfishly, that some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to be the first to take the test. T consented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I insisted that only a very light, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">superficial, treatment should be given, and to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">they consented. I have watched them carefully;</seg><seg type="columnLine">E. has kept accurate records of their pulse, respir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation and temperature, and we find that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">already show distinct signs of slight rejuvenation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnson and the other young men show it the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most markedly, but this is to be expected of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as their systems are more responsive and less de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terioration of cells and tissues renders the action</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the treatment more rapid. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Everything is most satisfactory. Burke and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Redfield look like men of forty, and declare they</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel better than they have felt for years. Johnson</seg><seg type="columnLine">has the fresh color and spirits of twenty, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions are in practically the same condition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Today, Montross took the treatment, and E. in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sists she will do so tomorrow. Of course, in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">case, I can do no less than follow, and yet, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how, I have a premonition that we have not. yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned all the powers or peculiarities of Juvenum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that we have been over-hasty in submitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves to the tests. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A terrible thing has happened. My worst fears</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been confirmed. We have all taken the treat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and we are all in the same awful predicament.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For several days the animals treated remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same state to which they had been altered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the treatment. Then, to my horror and amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, I noticed that the dog and parrot were show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing signs of growing constantly younger. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cur was acting more and more like a puppy; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parrot was losing its full plumage and was ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiring pin-feathers. I hurried to the apartments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Burke and Redfield and found both men in seclu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. Burke, who had been a stout, florid man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty had become unrecognizable as a young man</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thirty,-- slender, freckle-faced and red-haired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Redfield's alteration was even worse. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paunchy, gray-whiskered banker he had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">transformed into a sallow-faced young man. and.</seg><seg type="columnLine">catching a glimpse of myself in a mirror, T dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered that I, too, have lost ten years in appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance. Almost too distraught to express my fears</seg><seg type="columnLine">I rushed madly to E.'s office. But instead of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman T had expected to wed I found a beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl who, outwardly at least, appeared 110 more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than twenty years of age. She, however, did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">share my fears. She was overjoyed at the recovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her youthful beauty and she was elated at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">change which had taken place in myself. In vain</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tried to explain to her that if the rejuvenation</seg><seg type="columnLine">process continued we would all be regarded as</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere boys and girls; that already Burke and Red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field were afraid to appear before their employees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But she. perhaps because of her medical and</seg><seg type="columnLine">anatomical knowledge, argued that my fears were</seg><seg type="columnLine">groundless.

Johnson was a mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">lad, while E. and myself, who had been the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take the treatment and who had taken far less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the others, felt and looked like a youth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl of eighteen. Burke and Redfield were beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves. They had important business to at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tend to, and already their absence from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">offices was causing uneasiness. All seemed to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me for a way out of their difficulties, and, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out effect, I tried to make them see that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ones who had insisted when I had cautioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that, moreover, I had shown my faith in sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitting to the treatment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '"Realizing that no one would recognize the banker</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the merchant, I suggested that they go to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">offices, put their business in order, and then re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire to their apartments until I had had an oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity to carry on further tests of formula Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tross and myself had worked out. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are all lost.

And my wife! As I write, she who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">my beloved Elvira is creeping about the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I, the last of the ten to succumb to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effects of our accursed experiments, sit at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk, torn with unbearable dread, with indescrib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able horror at the fate which, so unconsciously, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have brought upon my wife and the others. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I am writing this in the same hand which</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 used when a full grown man, although I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt, no change in my brain, yet I am but a youth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mere stripling, a beardless boy of perhaps a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen years. Were it not for Elvira, were it not</seg><seg type="columnLine">that until her last moment I must care for her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would follow the example of Montross and John-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son and would hasten my end by taking a double</seg><seg type="columnLine">dose of Juvenum. But instead, I have destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything.

Never shall the world know how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do what we have done if I can prevent it. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall be left that will lie available for others. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as Elvira has drifted backward into that</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfathomable beyond whence all life comes, I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">face the most terrible fate of all. No one will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">left to care for me. I shall be a helpless infant</seg><seg type="columnLine">and. must, I feel sure, go through the retrocessional</seg><seg type="columnLine">process to oblivion, for I long ago promised Elvira</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I would not take my own life, and, I feel sure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will not be granted the solace of starving to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death, for I am convinced that this whole horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightmarish affair is but a reversion of life as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it has been for us; that time has been turned back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as related to our own existence, that if we sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vived the perils of infantile mortality nothing can</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent us from retroceeding in the same manner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that, as long as T did not starve to death while</seg><seg type="columnLine">an infant, I cannot hope to succumb to starvation</seg><seg type="columnLine">now that my infancy is to be repeated, even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are no loving hands to care for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And another strange thing has happened. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">late I have been aware of the presence of beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">about me.

Can it be possible that, having gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">back beyond the stage of human form at birth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have been unable to return to embryonic</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, and are still filling the atmosphere about</seg><seg type="columnLine">me? . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These will be my last lines. My beloved wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">has gone. To the very end she seemed happy. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">her baby eyes, as I tenderly, though clumsily fed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, was the look of contentment; her baby mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled, and there was none of the agony which</seg><seg type="columnLine">contorted the infantile countenances of Burke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Redfield and the others. This morning she faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">from sight and vanished, and I feel that some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where she is watching me and waiting for me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am more resigned to my fate now. And for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time I have given thought to matters aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">from our own affairs. What, I wonder, will the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world think when it finds that ten members of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">population have inexplicably vanished into thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">air? No doubt there will be investigations; the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">police will be called in; but only to make the mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery the greater. What will they think when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the baby clothes which have served for Burke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Redfield and even for Elvira in turn? Only I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be without the tiny garments. Long before my</seg><seg type="columnLine">body is small enough for them I will be unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress myself. I will shrink to an infant in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes I have on, in the makeshift, cut-down things</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am wearing, and crawling from them, a naked</seg><seg type="columnLine">infant, I shall probably find them an interesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaything. Strange, now that my fate is so near</seg><seg type="columnLine">at hand, I am so calm, that I can see the humor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation. But my great regret is that after</seg><seg type="columnLine">today I will be unable to record my sensations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even if my mind remains mature my childish hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be unable to hold a pen or form the letters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am now a child of eight or ten years in appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance and physical characters, and I am forced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sit upon a pile of books in order to write. Ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">since this morning I have realized I am dwindling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have been forced to add two books to the pile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But before I am unable to do so T must make some</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparations. I will place this journal among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">infant's garments and other things in a drawer</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond my own reach, for otherwise, in my infantile</seg><seg type="columnLine">state, T may tear and destroy the onlv record I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave of the incredible events which have transpired</seg><seg type="columnLine">here in my laboratory. I can write no more, My</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain is still clear and filled with the thoughts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grown man,--yes even the scientific side of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">intellect is unchanged. But I find the pen difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold, and my childish fingers can scarcely form</seg><seg type="columnLine">the characters I wish to write. And there is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more to record. I have sought perpetual youth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I have found it; but such a youth! Youth re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced to the nth degree, the utter youth of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible existence, the youth of the pre-natal, inex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicable germ of life, perhaps the-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The journal ended in an undecipherable scrawl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trembling, shaken, pale with the suspense of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had read, I sat staring, and was aware for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time that the vast laboratory was dusky with</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching night. Then, with a stifled cry, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang to my feet. An Invisible, intangible pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence seemed to be near.

He seemed to harbor no suspicions that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas might be appropriated by others for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own profit. Or perhaps the tremendous difficulties</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying in the path of accomplishment made him sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply scorn the ability of others to succeed, where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might fail. Then again, it may have been that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked far less freely to others than he did to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For that Schirmanhever did like me in his strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">impersonal way, I can have no doubt--I call myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">his best friend because I know he had no other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I first met Schirmanhever when he was living in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tumbledown cabin on a beach north of New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">City. He was introduced to me in town one day</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a mutual acquaintance, and something about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">features--I think it must have been the brilliance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his eyes--enlisted my interest immediately. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about thirty-five at the time, tall and thin, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark thick hair that fell low over his forehead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">straggled down his neck. He wore a shabby light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight overcoat, and looked generally unkempt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still, he had a striking personality. One felt his</seg><seg type="columnLine">frail, undernourished body was overengined with</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. He seemed burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up with ideas, though	--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said little. I grew to</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Schirmanhever, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">after my first visit I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">again as often as I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">manage it without seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to impose on his hos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitality. And in the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of subsequent events</seg><seg type="columnLine">those visits of mine to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin on that astonishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach made especially --</seg><seg type="columnLine">vivid memories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an astonishing beach. It represented the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last small stretch of coast near the great metropolis</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold out against invasion by the summer hordes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cabin was situated among a low ridge of sand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dunes separating the ocean from inland waters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Between the dunes and the bay ran a long narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">spit of marsh. It was because the ground here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so marshy, and would have to be drained and filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in before any building could be done, that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch of beach had remained undeveloped; on</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side of it, two miles distant, were large shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">resorts. The beach, piled high with great timbers,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">packing cases, cans, bottles, and other riff-raff flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">up by the tides, presented an astonishingly wild and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disordered appearance. At night, in both directions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a million lights traced the distant coast line; to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">southwest, in clear weather, might be seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fainter glimmer of the Coney Island boardwalk, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the Rockaways.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Here Schirmanhever lived the year round. Dilap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">idated in appearance, the cabin was quite snug in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. A chunk stove kept it warm on the coldest</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, and wood cost Schirmanhever nothing, as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay at his very doorstep on the beach in inexhaust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible supplies and the dunes held back the strong sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breezes. He bought his stores each week at a fish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing station across the bay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But on my first visit to this isolated .spot I became</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious to know how he solved the problem of water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed bad enough to have to tramp such a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance for food supplies, but how could he manage</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have so much water at hand? There was a suffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient supply of water at the cabin, not only for</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinking and cooking, but for washing also. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too interested in talking to Schirmanhever, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">noting the equipment of that part of the cabin cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained off from the rest which he called his lab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oratory, to wonder about his supply of fresh water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but no sooner was I alone on the train returning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the city than I found myself speculating about</seg><seg type="columnLine">this. Did Schirmanhever have a well? I dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed this conjecture as absurd since water from</seg><seg type="columnLine">any well sunk in those sand dunes would certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">be quite undrinkable. But where did he get it?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly I remembered that the same problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have existed for the old hermit who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin's previous inhabitant. This convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that whatever the problem's solution might be,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it could not be very mysterious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Still I was puzzled, especially when on my next</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit, I noticed that Schirmanhever, who happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be over on the mainland laying in supplies when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I arrived, was taking back nothing but provisions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                          Later, in the cabin, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">----mentioned the water prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lem to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, water was old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin's problem," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schirmanhever. "He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring it over from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mainland, as I did at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main reason he had for</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving here. Of course,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he added, after a moment's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">....... pause, "I don't have that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                       problem any more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The last few words he said willingly, and his ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression increased my interest. "How's that?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. "Have you found a nearer place to get it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I don't get it," he answered. "I make it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Oh!" I exclaimed, with a laugh at my own fool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishness. "Of course! You distill it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schirmanhever smiled again. "No," he said, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't distill it. But I make it just the same."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He got up to open the chunk stove, and throw in</seg><seg type="columnLine">another piece of wood. Outside a strong raw wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was blowing, rattling the sashes of one of the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows. Even though you could not see it, you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">TN presenting to our renders, one, who for Amazing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Stories is a new author, we believe that you will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">soon find that lie is a promising scientifirtion writer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The plot in this story is unusual, and at the same time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">most convincing. After all. why should there be no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">such thing as a chemical magnet? Any good chemist</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will tell you that the thing is not impossible per se, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that sooner or later it may be a fact. In any event, here</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we have a really excellent story that we know you will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">enjoy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">488</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sensed that vast expanse of nearby ocean over which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gale was driving. And I asked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You make it out of ocean water?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, out of ocean water," he replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE said nothing more at the time. Subse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently, when through our general conversa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions I had got an idea of the nature of his investi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gations, he was less reserved. I knew then that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had delved very profoundly into the nature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemical reactions, particularly those of solubility.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had the sort of mind that sees things always</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the imaginative viewpoint, that never allows</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination to become smothered beneath technical</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mathematical detail. He was able to arrive</seg><seg type="columnLine">at an actual picture of molecular processes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this reason he was able to make his tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">discoveries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day, drawing back the curtain of his labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory, he picked up a beaker, filled it with water, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked me to drop some table salt into it. When I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done so, he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That wasn't much trouble, was it? But what</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot of trouble to get that salt back again--I mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">by evaporation. There should be an easier way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldn't there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I replied I thought there should be. Schirman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hever now placed a clean sheet of white paper on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bench. On the paper he put a handful of sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had picked up outside. With the sand he</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixed up several pinches of iron filings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," he asked, "do you know any easy way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting those filings back again?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," I said, "if you had a magnet--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Exactly!" He produced one, and drew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">filings out of the sand, scraping them off the mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">net into a little separate pile. Then he looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. "By my process I can draw salts out of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as easily as that magnet draws iron filings out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sand. Let's say I've invented a chemical</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled to himself, and added, "That's an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">accurate way of putting it, of course, but it gives</seg><seg type="columnLine">the imagination something to feed on, which is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main thing. What I have devised is a way of get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting salts out of water without having to use any</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy. No heat under boilers, no electric current.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As simple as that," he snapped his fingers. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">why shouldn't it be easy ? There's very little energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">change when most salts are dissolved in water. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, what energy change there is is usually to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">good--the water is cooled off a little by the addi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the salt, so that there should be energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">given out, not taken in, when you get the salt back</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and there is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced at one corner of his laboratory where</seg><seg type="columnLine">there stood a queer closet-like arrangement with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipes leading in and out--evidently a casing around</seg><seg type="columnLine">some concealed apparatus. "Want to see it work?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded. I had noticed that corner of the lab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oratory before, and half-guessed its significance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But this was the first time Schirmanhever had of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered any information about it. Now he picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pailful of sea-water, and poured it into a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">funnel that protruded upwards from the wooden</seg><seg type="columnLine">casing. When the water had all vanished into the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">interior he came around to the front of the casing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned a valve. A moment later a bucket he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had placed on the floor began filling up. Schirman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hever, lifting the bucket so that the water would</seg><seg type="columnLine">flow noiselessly down the side, motioned to me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen. I heard in the interior of the apparatus a</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft, continuous sound similar to that which might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be made by tiny grains of something slipping down</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chute. When the flow of water had stopped, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bucket being nearly full, Schirmanhever lifted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dipperful of it up to my lips--it was as fresh pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">water as I have ever tasted. At the same moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">he held up for my inspection a miniature bin that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had drawn out of the interior of his apparatus;</seg><seg type="columnLine">its floor was covered with several inches of a whit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish salt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," he said, pouring the contents of the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">bin into the bucket of fresh water, "you see before</seg><seg type="columnLine">you the pailful of sea-water again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole process had taken so short a time--</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely more than a couple of minutes--and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation had been so noiseless, no sound coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the interior of the machine except that little</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispering noise made by the settling salt, that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only stand amazed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean to say," I exclaimed, "that that water</seg><seg type="columnLine">I drank"--and I looked at what remained in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dipper--"was some of the sea-water--and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">that salt you showed me-" '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was," answered Schirmanhever. "The very</seg><seg type="columnLine">same sea-water. My apparatus in here," he tapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wooden casing, "had simply divided it into its</seg><seg type="columnLine">two components--the pure water and the dissolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">salts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And it got it all out in that short time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schirmanhever smiled at the incredulity in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Then he frowned. "Yes, it got it all out, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's my trouble. That wate^ you tasted was pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">as rain water. But my process won't select yet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It pulls salts and suspended matter out in one lot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The hardest part of my job--that of developing</seg><seg type="columnLine">selective attraction for the various chemicals in so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lution, in the same way you might have different</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnets for iron, copper, silver, gold and so on,--</seg><seg type="columnLine">is still before me. Indeed, I don't know whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll ever be able to solve that problem. And if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't--" His brilliant, feverish eyes stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight into mine, and I read in them the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sentence--that if he didn't, all the knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had acquired thus far would die with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was the thing that astounded me. Once I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized Schirmanhever's invention actually would</seg><seg type="columnLine">extract salts from solution with such ease, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to me the most marvellous scientific achieve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the century. If he stopped at this point, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had only to commercialize his process to make an</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense fortune for himself. But Schirmanhever</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to think he had accomplished nothing as</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet. His whole being was wrapped up in making</seg><seg type="columnLine">the process the entirely perfect thing he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There!" he would exclaim, gesturing dramatic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally towards the leagues of ocean, "just look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the immensity of it! A greater storehouse of min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erals than you'll find in all the mines of the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">put together. All the metallic and non-metallic ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments in it in some shape or form. Vast Mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ocean, covering the greater portion of our planet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CHEMICAL MAGNET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">489</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">miles deep in places, and into which, sooner or</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, everything gets washed! All the metals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even one of the most precious--gold. Yes, gold in</seg><seg type="columnLine">undreamed of quantities! Scarcely even a trace by</seg><seg type="columnLine">analysis, but tons and tons when you have an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhaustible reservoir to comb it out of. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole ocean is your mine!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That word gold would make his eyes take on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater brilliance. I could see he craved power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted it more than anything in the world. More</seg><seg type="columnLine">than three years had passed now since I first met</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schirmanhever, and he was working night and day</seg><seg type="columnLine">to overcome that problem of selection and also to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed up his process of extraction. For, miracu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lously quick as this seemed to me, it was not nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick enough to suit Schirmanhever. He explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">how, with the millions of tons of sea-water he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to run through his apparatus in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get appreciable amounts of the precious chem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">icals he wanted most, there could not, if it was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a success, be any appreciable delay in the free flow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the current. At present, though he had greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfected the extraction during the past few years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the separation imposed a small but definite drag</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the moving liquid. This he was seeking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">eliminate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MORE than once, during this period, I doubted</seg><seg type="columnLine">■Schirmanhever's sanity. Haggard and wild-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed, his unkempt hair falling around his face, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ragged clothes flapping on his thin body, he had at</seg><seg type="columnLine">times a positively sinister air. Watching him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he paced the beach, muttering to himself, and cast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hungry glances seawards, I wondered if he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">really in his right mind. With all that driftwood</seg><seg type="columnLine">piled chaotically on the sand around him, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the appearance of a lone survivor of some tremen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dous wreck, driven crazy by solitude and privation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately watching the horizon for a sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke or sail. Years later, I was to "watch him</seg><seg type="columnLine">pacing in a similar manner another far-distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach--a beach more white and dazzling than this</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, the very calm of whose tropic beauty was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make more dreadful that awful scene of Schirman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hever's final disintegration. Then Schirmanhever,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man who had made his dreams come true--too</seg><seg type="columnLine">true, alas!--did really go mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It occurred to me sometimes that this story of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chemical magnet might be only his madness. For,</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember, that while I saw him put sea-water into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine, and take fresh water and salt out, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">word was my only proof that the latter were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">products of the former. Though Schirmanhever</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not hesitate to discuss with mo, the general</seg><seg type="columnLine">theories underlying his investigations, he never</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke of the details of his process. He frequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the curtains of his laboratory undrawn, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could talk to me as he worked, but at these</seg><seg type="columnLine">times the apparatus was always hidden from view</seg><seg type="columnLine">by its wooden casing, and he was obviously only</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged in experiments of minor importance;</seg><seg type="columnLine">whenever he was working on the apparatus itself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I could tell by the sound of the casing being</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged aside, the curtains were always drawn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tied. I began to wonder if inside that casing</seg><seg type="columnLine">there really was any apparatus, or whether it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a trick arrangement with which Schirman-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hever's overstrained mind practised a grotesque</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-deception. At last, curiosity getting the better</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all sense of decency, I took advantage of a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment when he had gone down to the ocean for</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, to slip into the laboratory and examine the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schirmanhever had been in the laboratory for</seg><seg type="columnLine">over an hour with the curtains drawn. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently had to interrupt an experiment to fetch</seg><seg type="columnLine">more water, for he had left hurriedly, in his haste</seg><seg type="columnLine">failing to fasten the curtains. I guessed I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the machine exposed to view--if there was any</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and I was right. The casing, hinged at the back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood open, revealing a short, thick cylinder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal, like a fat water boiler. Except for this cyl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inder, and the pipes leading in and out, the space</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside the casing was absolutely empty. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder a warning, "Hands off! Danger!" was</seg><seg type="columnLine">painted in large red letters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Staring at the cylindei-, I realized I hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned much. Either the cylinder was empty, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">within it was safely concealed all the vital mech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anism of Schirmanhever's process. And the cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der apparently had no opening through which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye could penetrate its interior. Then I noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">something I had missed at the first glance, a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">shutter at the top which evidently protected just</seg><seg type="columnLine">such an observation point as I was in search of.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reckless of the red warning on the cylinder, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached out to draw the shutter aside, at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time stooping to put my eye to the opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">My hand was grasped in mid-air--Schirman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hever stood beside me. He had seen me through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window and returned quietly. Instead of be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing angry, as I expected, he brushed aside my con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion and apologies with the mere remark:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You wouldn't have discovered anything, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have killed yourself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He closed the casing until I had left the labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory, then drew the curtains behind me, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed his experiment. He seemed to understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly that no motive worse than curiosity had</seg><seg type="columnLine">prompted me to violate his hospitality. This inci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent, indeed, led him to speak more freely about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">process than he had done before. He explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">how, like the French 75-mm. field-piece, the secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">of whose recoil mechanism is safeguarded against</seg><seg type="columnLine">detection by the mechanism blowing up and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroying itself as soon as tampered with by inex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pert hands, his invention would also explode if any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one but himself tried to examine it. He seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to read my thoughts about the curious simplicity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what I had seen--only that cylinder, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipes leading in and out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You were surprised because you saw nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">complicated," he said. "You expected the aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishing and the intricate. Why weren't there any</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires suggesting electricity? Well, inside that cyl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inder it isn't, of course, quite so simple as it is on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outside, but you'd be surprised if you knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what simple apparatus the cylinder does contain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nevertheless. Simple to your way of thinking, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is. Simple and empty in just the same way that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interior of an automobile would look simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">and empty to a person of olden times who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting everywhere for the horse that made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobile move. Simple and empty as an electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">490</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wire carrying current on a million-volt circuit</seg><seg type="columnLine">would seem to people who didn't know anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">about electricity, who never dreamed what power</seg><seg type="columnLine">was flowing silently along that little wire. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">process is simple because it depends on an entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">new principle. It's a principle as different from</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other in the world as, for instance, in the field</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vision, the color red is different from the color</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue. And that's about all I can tell you about it,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he finished with a smile, "except from our previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">talks you may be able to guess that it's a principle</seg><seg type="columnLine">depending, not unlike electricity, upon the mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious laws which control atomic and molecular</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His lips twitched as he smiled. It was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our last talks together--before he went away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schirmanhever had grown very thin and haggard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was experimenting against time. For he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a few months longer to live in the cabin. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">last this stretch of beach so long neglected by de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velopment companies was to be improved. A great</seg><seg type="columnLine">dredge had arrived on the bay side and was filling</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the land. Surveyors were staking out the marsh</seg><seg type="columnLine">into streets and lots. A line of telegraph poles</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang up. Schirmanhever watched these opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions with a dark look of hate. It was the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">of practicality pursuing him even into the solitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his wild home--driving him out. He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">given notice by the development company that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not occupy the land later than the beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the next summer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">(it TE has lived here for six years. Has he ac-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> li tually accomplished anything during this</seg><seg type="columnLine">period?" I used to ask myself. The men working</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the development company plainly regarded him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a crazy freak, and I wondered if they weren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. Did he really have anything to show for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor of all these years? Or was he simply a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">obsessed with an idea?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then one day the impossible happened. When I</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived at the cabin, Schirmanhever told me he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had inherited a fortune. A rich uncle--on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">father's side Schirmanhever was of German de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scent, on his mother's Irish--had just died, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left his wealth to him. Schirmanhever told me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">news without excitement. I confess I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubted his word, except that the arrival of a stout</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawyer, puffing from the exertion of the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">trudge, and with his shoes full of sand, supplied</seg><seg type="columnLine">an incontrovertible proof. I thought then that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schirmanhever's troubles were over--that the loss</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cabin would be of no importance to him, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he now had the means to equip a more comfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory in a far more convenient location. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schirmanhever stayed on in the cabin, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined to wind up his investigations where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had started them. Perhaps the fact that good</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortune had come his way only when he could al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most do without it, made him the more bitter. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">glances in the direction of that big dredge busily</seg><seg type="columnLine">filling in the swamp, of those steam shovels tear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the sand dunes, held the same personal an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tagonism. But one day when I visited him, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed calmer than ever I had seen him before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as the launch was carrying me away, he called</seg><seg type="columnLine">after me in a peculiar tone that seemed to carry</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with it, a strange presentiment, "Well, good-bye!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the last time I was to see Schirmanhever</seg><seg type="columnLine">for many months. When I next visited the island</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was gone. The abandoned cabin was being torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">down by workmen who speculated jokingly on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">use that had been made of the fragments of ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus and glassware left behind. The surveyors</seg><seg type="columnLine">were shooting the line of a road that would pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight through the site of the cabin. Watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">it crumbling beneath the blows of sledge and ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer, I got a sudden sharp sense of loss. I walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the beach, picking my way among the debris</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast up by the sea, wondering if Schirmanhever</seg><seg type="columnLine">would write, or if he had gone out of my life for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. So two years went by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile all my suspicions about the non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence of his chemical magnet, as he had called</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, seemed confirmed. I watched the newspapers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scientific journals for some startling report of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great new discovery. I re-visited the island,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its progressive appearance--sidewalks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">already down, and carpenters hammering on sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer cottages everywhere--made the past seem a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream. I remembered that last glimpse of Schir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manhever standing on the shore growing smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the launch sped for the mainland, and I felt a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little hurt that that casual "good-bye" had been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only warning given me of his departure. And more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than once, the absurdity of his having accomplished</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything momentous in that makeshift little build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing by the sea occurred to me, though at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I could not but recall that the early investiga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of Steinmetz and other great scientists had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been conducted in equally humble surroundings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During this period of silence I had in my keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one little thing to give reality to the'vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schirmanhever and his splendid aspirations. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a small scrap of paper, the beginning of a let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter I had found in the sea grass on that morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the cabin was being torn down. On it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dear Anne: At last, after all these years, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The writing was Schirmanhever's, and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently been unable to go any further, or else</seg><seg type="columnLine">had discarded and thrown away this first attempt at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a letter to the woman who had rejected his love.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was about four years after Schirmanhever's</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappearance that I suddenly found his name on</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone's lips. Almost overnight, it seemed, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had acquired international renown. The story of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his marvellous chemical discoveries leaped to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front page of the newspapers. I read of the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">plants he had built both on the east and west coasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">which now by some extraordinary secret process</seg><seg type="columnLine">were producing in abundance almost every known</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemical. The four years of delay he had appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently utilized to adapt his process to large-scale</seg><seg type="columnLine">production. At any rate, the name Schirmanhever</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now certainly one for the man in the street to</seg><seg type="columnLine">conjure with. It was rumored he had actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a way of transmuting sea-water into gold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was said this Schirmanhever was on his way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming the richest man in the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The events of the next few years are history, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shall pass over them briefly. We all remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schirmanhever's first great industrial triumph, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CHEMICAL MAGNET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">491</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking up of the potash monopoly, which after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world war had reverted to the Kali-syndicate;</seg><seg type="columnLine">how Schirmanhever's American plants supplied</seg><seg type="columnLine">potash to the home markets at half the price of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foreign product imported from the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strassfurt deposits; his development of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange and stupendous floating hulks, known as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Magnet Fleet, which manufactured their car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes of precious chemicals from ocean water on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the journey between ports; how Germany's pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eminence in the field of industrial chemistry waned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that nation's achievements in building up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">synthetic dye industry fading to nothing beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossal accomplishments of the young American</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist; the revolutionary shift of industry from</seg><seg type="columnLine">land to ocean, beginning a new epoch in the history</seg><seg type="columnLine">of civilization, with the radical alterations it neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitated in the whole economic life of the world;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the award to Schirmanhever of the Nobel Prize</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his rejection of it; the abortive attempt of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nations to combat Schirmanhever's accumulation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ocean gold by establishing an international paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">currency; the sharp drop in worldwide prosperity</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as Schirmanhever ordered production to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cease at all his plants and popular opinion forcing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the powers to come to terms; the passing of pov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erty everywhere as the hitherto untouched re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sources of the ocean--that ocean which covers</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-fourths of the earth's surface, and has a vol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ume of three hundred and fifteen million cubic</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles--began to be exploited on a gigantic scale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Schirmanhever's prestige and power increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he was virtually dictator of world affairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were told of the many deaths resulting from</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempts to discover the secret of his chemical mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">net--how the Neptune, the largest vessel in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Magnet Fleet, tampered with by engineers seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to uncover the mystery of its vital operations, blew</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in dock at Hoboken, killing a hundred men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrecking the nearby piers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL this, I say, has become history. Let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">come then, without further delay, to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">final and fatal period of Schirmanhever's career in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I was again destined to have a share.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Throughout the years of his success our meetings</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been few, but we kept in touch'with each other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I had at last seen his name in the papers</seg><seg type="columnLine">after that long interval of silence, I met Schirman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hever in New York City; he told me very briefly</seg><seg type="columnLine">how busy he had been commercializing his process,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sketched some of his future plans. Later we</seg><seg type="columnLine">met again in New York sevei'al times, also in Lon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don, Paris and Berlin. Needless to say, every min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute of Schirmanhever's time during these years</seg><seg type="columnLine">was priceless; his waiting rooms were thronged</seg><seg type="columnLine">with financiers, scientists, and reporters requesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">an interview; but I had only to give my name in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to be admitted immediately. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">look of genuine pleasure on his face as, putting</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside for the time being the enormous weight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">business resting on his shoulders, he rose to greet</seg><seg type="columnLine">me; with the world at his feet he seemed to regret</seg><seg type="columnLine">his past obscurity, to long to be able to return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Once, glancing at me strangely, his eyes flash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their old excitement, he started to make some</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion, but after a few words broke off to a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mutter, "No, I'm not quite ready yet--I must wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little longer!" Then one day I received that mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orable telegram requesting me to come immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">to San Francisco. And a week later I was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schirmanhever's yacht with him bound for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lovely little island in the Pacific which fate had</seg><seg type="columnLine">decreed only one of us should ever leave alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arrived at the island, an exquisite pearl of trop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical beauty, with great feathery palms swaying</seg><seg type="columnLine">high in the sky over a white beach terminating in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a coral reef, where the surf thundered night and</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, the yacht was dismissed, the captain receiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing orders to proceed to Honolulu. A date, sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral months distant, was set for the yacht's return</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the island. A comfortable bungalow, well</seg><seg type="columnLine">stocked with provisions, had been built on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island, but Schirmanhever and myself were the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabitants. Anchored off the island was a float-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing laboratory, in general design like a miniature</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel of the Magnet Fleet, which Schirmanhever</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspected on the first day of our arrival.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That he had come to this remote spot to push</seg><seg type="columnLine">his investigations into some mysterious realm of</seg><seg type="columnLine">science, which even his genius had not yet ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plored, was known to me by now. But the exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature of this research he had not told me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only guess from his suppressed excitement</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the cruise that he considered all his previ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous discoveries of negligible importance compared</seg><seg type="columnLine">with those he was now about to attempt. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled or the island, he was soon spending all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours in the floating laboratory. At the beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was allowed to come aboard with him, but a day</seg><seg type="columnLine">came when he put a stop to my visits. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about this time that Schirmanhever, while we sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">together on the veranda of the bungalow, gave me</seg><seg type="columnLine">my first cue to the problem he was working on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After briefly recapitulating his past accomplish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments--the invention of the first chemical magnet</seg><seg type="columnLine">that indiscriminately drew all salts out of solution,</seg><seg type="columnLine">later the perfection of the process to leave in solu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion the sodium chloride of little value, and only</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw out the more precious potassium, iron, cop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per, aluminum, nickel, lead, barium, manganese,</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver and gold salts, the iodine compounds, phos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phates, and radioactive minerals, and these not in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mixed mass, but each chemical pulled separately</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of solution by its own individual magnet, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pure state--he came to his latest idea, that of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloping a chemical magnet of super-strength,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would be capable of dragging out of sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">water hitherto unknown chemicals--chemicals of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the ocean held only such an infinitesimal</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace that no ordinary method of analysis could de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tect them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Chemicals," said Schirmanhever, "which may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be tremendously more powerful and mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the radioactive minerals, and which may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed of amazingly new and vital properties^</seg><seg type="columnLine">which may, who knows, have actually led to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">origin of-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He broke off. At the time I did not grasp the</seg><seg type="columnLine">true meaning of what he said. I only had a vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">but distinct sense of danger. Perhaps it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmth of the tropic night, and Schirmanhever's</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing eyes close to mine, the black outlines</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the starlit sky of those tall palms rem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">492</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">iniscent of days when the whole of the earth was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vast fecund jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Won't there be a risk in such experiments?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. "If such chemicals do exist, and you collect</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in any quantity, mayn't they have a frightful</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect on the human body?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very likely," answered Schirmanhever, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement in his voice proved how little he cared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He added, "There's always a risk in the Unknown."</seg><seg type="columnLine">From now on he grew pale with a dreadful pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lor. He lost his appetite. He had trembling fits</seg><seg type="columnLine">that made me fear he had caught some tropical</seg><seg type="columnLine">fever. I saw him emerge at intervals from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior of the floating laboratory waving his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him as though to push back an insufferable</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat. He paced the white beach, muttering to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, and gesticulating. One day he shouted:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've found it at last--the^Secret of Life! I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got the thing that first brought Life into exist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence! I've got it there, out there!" He pointed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floating laboratory. "That much of it!" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupped his hands. "And before I'm through I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have this much of it!" He threw out his arms in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wild gesture that seemed to embrace the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A thrill of horror shot through me. Suddenly I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized the truth of why Schirmanhever was wast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing away--remembered my casual suggestion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night, forgotten next morning. Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadlier than poison was devouring him. I seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm, tried to prevent him from going out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat again. Schirmanhevet- fought himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose, and the expression in his eyes as he leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">away told me he was mad, utterly mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next week was a nightmare. Schirman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hever, with the cunning of madness, slept on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat now, fearing I would detain him if he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the bungalow. But he came on shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">stealthily and in the moonlight I saw him several</seg><seg type="columnLine">times pacing the beach, tottering along in a queer</seg><seg type="columnLine">way like a drunken man. At last I could stand it</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer. I resolved, even at risk of my own life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make a trip to the floating laboratory, find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he was doing there, and bring him forcibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I set out one evening in the dusk. As I put foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the deck of the boat, Schirmanhever emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a hatchway. He was gasping, his eyes were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">maniacal, but at sight of me he seemed to pull him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self together. With a convulsive effort he put his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands to his head, and in that instant I believe he</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized he was dying. Turning, he staggered back</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the steps into the interior of the vessel, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to the machinery, then appeared on deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">again holding a large platinum dish containing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious salt that glowed with a pale sea-green</seg><seg type="columnLine">phosphorescence. I had one glimpse of this strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance, then Schirmanhever had flung the dish</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the ocean, which swallowed it with a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiss. In one final moment of sanity Schirmanhever</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped my hand, cried hoarsely, "Go! Don't wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minute! Get back to the shore right away, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause this"--his nerveless fingers slipped away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from mine, to indicate the boat we were standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on--"won't be here more than a few seconds." Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he collapsed on the deck, dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An uncontrollable panic seized me in the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that prostrate body, that dreadful, ominous</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence by which I was surrounded, and springing</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into the skiff, I rowed madly for shore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scarcely was my foot on land than there was a roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind me, and the floating laboratory split apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">into burning fragments, which an instant later was</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallowed by the water. After more than a month</seg><seg type="columnLine">of frightful solitude, the yacht returned and car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried me back to America. Subsequent develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment are known to all--how, one by one, Schir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manhever's plants ceased to function, as though in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chemical magnets there were some vital ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. corresponding to an electric battery, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed renewal after a certain number of years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the secret of restoring this energy had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">known only to him. Frantic endeavors are still be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing made to rediscover Schirmanhever's secrets, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order once again to infuse vitality into that great</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean industry which now lies idle. And--most in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teresting of all to me are the many speculations in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dulged in by scientists upon the nature of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious elements which caused Schirmanhever's</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible end, until today it is generally recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Schirmanhever actually did manage to extract</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ocean water in an appreciable quantity--</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was that greenish phosphorescent substance in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the platinum dish, undoubtedly--certain rare but</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceedingly complex and powerful chemicals</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, millions of years ago, when the earth was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all ocean, first brought life into being.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The End.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Master Mind of Mars</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By EDGAR RICE BURROUGHS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A New Story by the Master of Scientifiction</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">also</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Face in the Abyss</seg><seg type="columnLine">By A.

Well, no matter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here I was walking by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hicks' side and listening</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his conversation, bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his home to inspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">another one of his auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic inventions. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">even offering him one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my best cigars!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"The reason I came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see you first," Hicks was</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying, "is because I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are capable of judg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a thing objectively.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Few people can.

While this story is written in a light vein, it should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be remembered that many devices of this kind are apt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn out realities sometime in the future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some years ago, the Editor of this publication, during</seg><seg type="columnLine">a friendly gathering ventured the opinion that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">wash the dishes and dry them without even netting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands wet, -whereupon the company proceeded to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen and the Editor, by attaching a plain rubber hose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the hot water faucet, washed the dishes simply by play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a stream of hot ivatcr on them, after which they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted out and put in a tray, -where the lieat dried them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the time, this caused a great deal of merriment, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">a device of this kind is now actually on the market, and is</seg><seg type="columnLine">being sold at about $5.00, which proves that even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most ridiculous invention may turn out to be practical.</seg><seg type="columnLine">494</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with us the night of that. . er . . unfortunate little</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble with the Automatic Dining Table can do so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They simply washed their hands of that invention</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of me. Yet the dining table is being put on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">market now. We have a company organized and</seg><seg type="columnLine">will soon have our factory equipped. Accidents will</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen with any invention when it is being tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. Think what the automobile was like twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago! But I can't convince that crowd, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfortunately they are my best friends,--or at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Hicks' talk went on, and by the time we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived at his house 1 had promised him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">straighten everything out for him with his relatives</seg><seg type="columnLine">and friends and to persuade them all to come and</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspect his new invention, though I had not as yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen it myself. Perhaps that will give you some</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of Hicks' powers of conversation. But here</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were at his house, a three-story affair of many</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms. We climbed the stairs and presently we</seg><seg type="columnLine">found ourselves in a living room of moderate di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mensions, pleasantly decorated and neatly and ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gantly furnished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looks like an ordinary living room, eh?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hicks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Like a more than ordinarily pleasant one, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should say," I replied, allowing myself to slip into</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the several overstuffed chairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And yet, O'Keefe, this room is as unlike an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary room as a hen's egg is unlike a golf ball,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Hicks. "This is room Number One in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fully Automatic Apartment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And how does this room Number One in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fully Automatic Apartment," I said in jocular</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone, "differ from any other? Surely you are not</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to kid me into believing that there is any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing unusual about it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I am not trying to kid you," Hicks replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rising dignity. "I merely state a fact when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I say it is different. And that difference consists</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the circumstance that this room is self-cleaning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-sweeping, self-arranging. Possibly it has</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped the notice of your astute mind," he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued in a tone slightly tinged with irony, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is a push button board near this door." With</seg><seg type="columnLine">this he indicated a small board neatly done in scin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tillating glass and with a row of mother-of-pearl</seg><seg type="columnLine">push buttons disposed on it. "Possibly also," Hicks</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on, "you have not noticed several other</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiarities. But I will now let action show, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">words," and rising, he pressed one of the buttons</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the switchboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IMAGINE my surprise when the chair in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sat, together with a large rocker near me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table upon which I had just deposited my hat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly began to move, and in another second had</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled half way across the room,'all in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction, leaving a swath several yards wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengthwise of the room free and clean of all furni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. Before I had time to recover, another sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise topped this one. At the end of the room a</seg><seg type="columnLine">low grating such as commonly covers the register</seg><seg type="columnLine">for hot-air systems suddenly swung open and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged what for a brief, startled moment I men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tally put down as a fierce animal with a bushy tail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in which a second later I recognized a suction</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeper with bag attached. This sweeper evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently had a mind of its own, besides considerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, because without any visible help, it hastily</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded along the wall in a straight line and, ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rived at the opposite end of the long room, moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">sideways by its own width and retraced its way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping in a strictly straight line. Before my be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildered gaze, this mechanical animal came and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went along the floor until it nearly grazed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs. I was just about to stutter a few words of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewilderment when the machine, arrived at its</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting point, suddenly halted. There was a click</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a purr, and the entire mass of furniture£~Viow</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded to one side of the room, started to rnove,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my chair carrying me along; and lo! in a jiffy it</seg><seg type="columnLine">all was lined up along that side of the room which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just been swept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How does it strike you, old man?" The voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the inventor seemed to come from afar, so dazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'll be dashed," was all I managed to stut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter as I wiped the sweat off my forehead. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">again that diabolically clever, superhuman-minded</seg><seg type="columnLine">carpet sweeper started on its methodical way, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">did it stop until it had completed its work and every</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch in the room had been gone over. As it neared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall, another door, similar to the one from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it had appeared, swung open, the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered, and with a click both doors swung shut.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At once there was another movement among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">furniture, and those pieces which had last moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the way returned to their original position,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the entire room was again neatly arranged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The inventor struck a match and lit a cigarette</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I wiped the perspiration off my face. "Well?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he inquired casually, between two puffs of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigarette.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My voice came back to me. "Hicks," I said, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know what to tell you. You have handed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surprise of my life. When you mentioned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic apartment, . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Calm yourself, my boy," placidly stated Hicks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I have just demonstrated to you the Automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carpet Sweeper and the Self-Arranging Furniture</seg><seg type="columnLine">--just one feature of my Automatic Apartment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tell you the secret, too--electro magnetism, heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron plates are attached low down under the furni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture--you will note the furniture is all somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. A system of electro magnets is arranged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows under the flooring. When I push the button,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first thing that happens is that one row after</seg><seg type="columnLine">another of the electro magnetic poles becomes mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">netized and then demagnetized, thus moving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">furniture along. The suction sweeper is furnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">with power of its own, but also kept true to its path</seg><seg type="columnLine">by remagnetization of row after row of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetic field. But I will now show you some</seg><seg type="columnLine">things which are really remarkable. Let us pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceed to the kitchen." And thither he led the way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I followed, trying to brace myself for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next surprise. We entered the kitchen, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">spacious and beautifully arranged, with cheerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors decorating the walls and ceiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked around me. Everything was there that</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be found in a well appointed kitchen. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sink was of porcelain, but I could see at once that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was more to it than just a sink. My ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">HICKS' INVENTIONS WITH A KICK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">495</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tioning glance was interrupted by Hicks' watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An Automatic Dish-Washing Device, of course,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he explained. "But more than that: an Automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dish Conveyor. Anything set down on this end-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less belt is immediately conveyed into the dish</seg><seg type="columnLine">washer, washed, dried and carried out, and depos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ited at the opposite end."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He placed several cups, saucers, knives and forks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a couple of large pans on what looked like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-enameled mat. Above the sink was a push</seg><seg type="columnLine">button. He pressed it. Instantly the dishes moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a rapid pace toward a long box-like object upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">one end of the sink. A rail on the conveyor opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trap door, through which the dishes disappeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the door closed. I heard the splashing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, which continued for fully a minute. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly the noise ceased, there was a click, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">array of dishes reappeared on the other side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">box, dry, clean, and shining, and stopped under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath a china-cupboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I did not so far provide anything to distribute</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dishes 011 the shelf," half apologetically said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inventor. "But for the present this will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, Hicks--" I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cctttELL, let us pass on to something interest-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> VV ing," the inventor, seemingly ignoring my</seg><seg type="columnLine">interruption, said in a tone of one bored with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trivialities of everyday existence. "As I said be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, this is a Fully Automatic Apartment. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">means it does its own work. You only do the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tractive part of housekeeping. You do not sweep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you do not clean, you wash no dishes, brush no</seg><seg type="columnLine">cobwebs, scrub no floors, polish no shoes. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">propose, as it were, and the apartment disposes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In developing this invention the central idea was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that drudgery has 110 place in the scheme of life of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the modern man or woman. My hope was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to take that drudgery out of life,--and I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve that I may say that I have in a measure suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded. Now . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, Hicks--" I said, in a tone of awe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now look at this ceiling, for instance," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hicks, seemingly unaware of my astonishment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"To the casual glance it looks like any other ceil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, only with ornamental features ordinarily lack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in a kitchen ceiling. In reality the design is</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked out in tiny perforations, the ceiling ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terial being sheet metal. Above this perforated</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling is an air space connected with a powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">suction system. Just a moderate amount of air is</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually circulating through this system. But if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I turn this switch"--he did and instantly a sighing</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise was to be heard--"then a powerful exhaust</seg><seg type="columnLine">is turned on, and cobwebs, dust, smoke and any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else in the way of dirt disappears. If I take,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for instance, this handful of flour and scatter it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air, it does not, as you seemed to fear it would,</seg><seg type="columnLine">judging by the speed with which you tried to duck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">settle all over you and spoil your new clothes, but"</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and he pointed to the cloud of flour rapidly van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishing through the ceiling--"it simply disappears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the ceiling is virtually only a fine mesh, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no place for dust, dirt, or cobwebs to stay, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">this tremendous suction is turned on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While I was trying to formulate in my mind an</seg><seg type="columnLine">apology for my rudeness in the morning, Hicks</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, following out this idea, what would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way to clean the floor? What, O'Keefe, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the way?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, what would be more natural than to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor also perforated, but instead of washing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, as it were, by air, to wash it with water?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">queried Hicks, answering his own question. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to admit that he had me there. "Well, anyway,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he continued, "that is the way I reasoned and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will note something which probably escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">your eye when you entered, and that is that the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">is also full of small perforations worked out in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasing design. This floor, too, is of metal, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">below it there is a flat tank which can at will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with water and emptied. If I press this but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton the water will rise. Step on one of these mats</seg><seg type="columnLine">and watch." Here he pointed out one of three or</seg><seg type="columnLine">four cork mats such as are sometimes used in bath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms, about an inch or so high. We stepped up</seg><seg type="columnLine">on one, and already we saw the water rising in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand tiny fountains, each one about a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch high, until the whole floor was submerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a quarter inch of water. "We do not need</seg><seg type="columnLine">to push any button again to make the water go</seg><seg type="columnLine">down," Hicks continued, "but, as you see, it is now</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappearing, carrying with it dirt, dust, and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease germs. The floor is now," he went on in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone of a lecturer explaining some wonder of na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, "still wet, but by pushing this button I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse the process you saw a minute ago, and air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this time warm, dry air, is forced through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling from above, passing through the floor below</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wake of the water of which the last is now</seg><seg type="columnLine">running down the drain, which can accommodate</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cubic foot of water a second, just as also the sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply pipe is unusually large, permitting a flow of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cubic foot every two seconds under the normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure of 110 pounds per cubic inch prevailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the water system of this town. As you will note,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor is already dry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I Tooked and saw. I was feeling a little feeble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I remember wondering if I had not had some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of somebody's homebrew that morning, for I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">having a queer feeling in my head. The automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleaning business was too much for an ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. I told Hicks so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have some other features here which I wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show you," said Hicks, "but it is perhaps just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well that you see them when the company are</seg><seg type="columnLine">assembled. You have seen enough, my boy, I think,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to believe me now when I tell you that I have some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing out of the ordinary, something unique and</seg><seg type="columnLine">something for which the world will be grateful in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the years to come when by its means the drudgery</seg><seg type="columnLine">of housekeeping will have been ended. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Keefe, will you arrange this thing for me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my--er, former--friends ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was a useless question. In the first place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had already promised him, and besides, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I had seen I would have arranged for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">King of Iceland to come and see it. Why, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful, marvelous, big--to think of such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea. And the way he had it figured out--pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">per square inch--cubic feet per second--you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">496</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that kind of thing always gets me. I have a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of respect for mathematics and engineering, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know nothing about them. I told him I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately go and see those friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was the following Tuesday that they were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">assembled. I still had a black eye, received</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Smith, the first one I tried, threw me out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his house, but such was my enthusiasm that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to convince even him by ignoring his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brutal attack, and he was present. So was Hicks'</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle Jeremiah, looking as sour as ever, and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">aunt Eulalia. There was Irvine and Mrs. Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there were, besides, Professor Dinker and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fianciSe, Miss Peak, a prim person somewhat ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced beyond mere youth, with glasses, a pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">red nose in a pale face, and opinions of her own.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And there was Hicks and myself. We had all gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the living room and had seen what I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">described, and now we were in the kitchen and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inventor was talking--as usual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is something still new to you, my dear</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Keefe," Hicks was saying. "This is the Auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic Shoe Shining Stand. By pushing this but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, this trap door drops, revealing, as you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">note, a foot rest such as is commonly used on shoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">shiners' stands, except that this is about a foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the floor. If now, Professor," Hicks said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waving his hand toward the man of science, "you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be kind enough to place your foot upon this</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest, you will all see that first this padded arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes hold of it, clamping, as it were, over the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">step to hold the foot securely down. You will note</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the machine works for exactly three minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then lets go. This works automatically, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, and you will yourselves be able to watch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">process without my telling you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We watched and we saw a hook-like arm, hinged</seg><seg type="columnLine">at its back end, describe a semi-circle, almost ca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ressingly taking hold of the Professor's foot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently but firmly holding it down. Next, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">coarse brushes started to work lengthwise of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoe, removing any dirt there was along the soles</seg><seg type="columnLine">--if there was any. These brushes were fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a sort of small truck which ran back and forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a pair of rails straddling the footrest, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they suddenly withdrew, they were followed by two</seg><seg type="columnLine">black polishing brushes running the same way, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a third brush issuing from the side and polishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of the shoes. They moved at great speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they worked two or three minutes, when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly slid back, the clamp opened, and the Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor's foot, with shoe polished to mirror-shine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was released. Everybody murmured his astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How ever do those brushes get any blacking?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked the practical Mrs. Smith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A very natural question, Madam, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is very pertinent," responded the inventor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The solution is as simple as it is efficient. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing out, each brush must pass over a roll upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which blacking is distributed by another roll in</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much the same way that the ink is distributed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a printing press. So that part of the inven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion," he added modestly, "cannot be termed my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think it's marvelous," Mrs. Smith replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"To think of all those things that you have shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">us this morning. You call this an invention--why</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's dozens of inventions. Oh, wouldn't I love to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live in this apartment!" she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, now," interposed Irvine, "do you think,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hicks, that all that machinery is going to work?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isn't something apt to go wrong? That thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the Professor's foot down, for instance. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">say it don't let go for three minutes. But some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing might happen and you might want to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away before then, say in three seconds. Supposing</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a fire, then what? I am still waiting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the rest of your apartment, but off-hand this</seg><seg type="columnLine">strikes me as something to be considered."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> People who must take the cheer out of life are</seg><seg type="columnLine">an abomination to me. I would have liked to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">told Irvine so. Couldn't the fellow see how won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful it all was? But I could have saved myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">the worry, for Hicks had the answer ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A natural thought, Irvine," he smiled. "When</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said that the arm would not let loose under three</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, what I meant was, of course, unless it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were released before by pressing the release but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton right under the starting button, just as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn an electric light off after it has been turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. Three minutes is merely the time required for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a perfect shine and to insure the best results. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">time-limit device is installed but merely as an aid</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the user, not as its master."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IRVINE looked a little abashed at this natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation. "I may as well state now," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inventor, "that this time I have left nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. I built a special device which automatically</seg><seg type="columnLine">operated the various mechanisms, turning them on</seg><seg type="columnLine">and off, and reversing them hundreds of times a</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, to insure that every part worked as it should.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also, I operated the various machines at a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of speeds. The dish washer, the sweeper, the shoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">shiner, and all other devices are, in fact, still hooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up so that they can be run at up to three times</seg><seg type="columnLine">their present operating speed, which was chosen</seg><seg type="columnLine">by me as the ideal because the most efficient. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeds are greater than words and, therefore, let</seg><seg type="columnLine">us now, after this little sample of work of the Fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">Automatic Apartment, proceed with a practical</seg><seg type="columnLine">demonstration of the larger features. Let me turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this switch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did, and then opened a large box containing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a powdery substance. "Knowing is believing, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make my demonstration convincing, I have here</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is called fuller's earth. It is a light, dusty</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance, and it could very properly be classed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirt. I have explained the action of the ceiling to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Let us now see what becomes of this earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I shall fling into the air." With this he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached into the box and scattered a handful in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air. Everybody dodged and Mrs. Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed, while even the prim Miss Peak lost sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly some of her composure as she saw the thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud of white dirt starting into the air. But, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if by magic, the cloud rose and instantly disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared through the ceiling. Nobody's clothes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">soiled with even a speck of dust. "How is this?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled the inventor, as he took handful after hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful of the stuff and flung it above him, the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">each time instantly disappearing through the ceil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">HICKS' INVENTIONS WITH A KICK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">497</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. "The ceiling, I believe, is doing its work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now let us try the floor. I push this switch, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what happens?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly there was a sound I did not like. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know I have a sort of an instinct for that kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing; I can sort of feel when something is wrong.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something seemed to work with an uncalled-for</seg><seg type="columnLine">force, for there was a vibrating and gurgling I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not heard the last time. Instinctively I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the inventor, who had grown the color of pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheese and was fumbling with a push button. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong one," I heard him groan. "The wrong one!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">0,	why did I leave that experimental stuff here?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then suddenly there was action. Straight in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air, out of a thousand holes, there shot as many</seg><seg type="columnLine">streams of water, which rose six or seven feet high.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In an instant everybody was drenched from head</seg><seg type="columnLine">to foot. All those present were so dumfounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">that for a few moments nobody moved. In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this upside downpour was so thick that one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly look through it. Just then the inventor</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a mighty wrench on the switchboard and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">streams ceased. But there were three inches of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water on the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What in the hotel is the matter?" roared Irvine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was the first to recover his senses. "What is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter, Hicks? Are you trying to drown us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I accidentally pushed the experimental switch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it refused to kick off. It doesn't matter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll ..." stuttered Hicks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the devil do you mean, doesn't matter?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellowed Smith. "Don't you see that you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely ruined all our clothes? And it doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter! Now of all the . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "1 didn't mean it that way, Smith," wailed Hicks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll turn on the warm air and we will all be dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a minute." With feverish hands he fingered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">switchboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had all been recovering, and as we recovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and everybody looked at himself, drenched from</seg><seg type="columnLine">head to foot, there was a feeling in the air as of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen thunderstorms brewing and ready to break.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something would have to happen to divert those</seg><seg type="columnLine">people from dwelling on their troubles, I thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as I thought, it did. Hicks had found the but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, and there was a click.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  All at once, I heard a high whine, and instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was an explosive puff, and the air was white.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just before I closed my eyes, I saw why it was white.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the fuller's earth, a matter of twenty pounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so, returning well distributed from the ceiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same way it had come, with the same force,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and every bit that had been put in. Instantly our</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet clothes, for the most part dark-colored, as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was winter, from our hats down to our shoes, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if covered with flour. The professor wiped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and smeared a broad streak of it over his nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mouth. It was so funny that I could not help</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing. He tried to glare at me, but was cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">short by a fit of sneezing. Even in the act of laugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, I was seized, and in a moment all the others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everybody was sneezing his head off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hee, kachoo! He, kachoo! Hicks!" screamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith between spasms, "what, kachoo; in the hell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">kachoo! are you doing; kachoo, kachoo! Turn the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blooming, kachoo! thing off! I, kachoo! kachoo!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he choked and could not go on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am ha-ha-ha, kachoo! turning it off; I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn it off, I have turned it off, kachoo! kachoo!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">coughed the inventor as well as he could, between</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneezes. "There will be no more of it, kachoo!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER a few minutes the dust settled and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">babel of sneezes ceased. Then a flood of elo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quence broke loose. Everybody was telling Hicks</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he thought of him. In his misery, the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy inventor turned and started to fool with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">switchboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lead the way out, Hicks, let us go and never</seg><seg type="columnLine">see you again!" roared Irvine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dismiss us instantly, sir," sternly ordered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor, who had managed to regain as much of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dignity as was possible with a face like a miller</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clothes that looked as if they had been through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flour mill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The back way is the quickest way out," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inventor, eager to get rid of his company. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped ahead toward the back door, the others fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing. But it was locked from the outside. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have an electric lock on there," he muttered, as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers sought another switchboard,--there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">switchboards everywhere on the walls, and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been wondering how he kept them apart. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn later. The shoe shining machine trap door</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened out into the room at the exact moment that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the professor approached with dignified step. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he slipped on one of the wooden mats and fell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing on his back, with his neck on the footrest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the shoe shining machine. I gasped. Instantly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foot clamp swung over, lovingly taking hold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the professor's throat and gently but determinedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding down his head. Before our horrified gaze,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stiff revolving brushes appeared as if by magic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with a couple dozen swift and vigorous strokes</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared the professor's ears for what was to come.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the stiff bristles did their work, his shriek of</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperation could be heard a mile. The prim Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peak, forgetting her dignity, came screaming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her betrothed's aid, but was unable to lift the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamp. I tried, but it was no use. The roughing</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushes had by this time finished, and now appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the polishing outfit. Immediately the professor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire face was covered with an even coat of black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the brushes started to rub down to an op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tical polish. Even with the full realization of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation, I could not refrain from admiring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughness and fantastic speed with which those</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushes worked. Judging things objectively is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">habit with me, you know. In a few seconds the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor's nose shone like a super-polished black</seg><seg type="columnLine">knob, while other parts of his facial anatomy were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking on a wonderful shine. Ninety-five strokes a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute, the inventor had said. It seemed more like</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred and ninety-five. By George, the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimental speed must be turned on! That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. I remembered. These were just some ideas</seg><seg type="columnLine">that flashed through my mind--funny how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">human mind will work in close situations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor's struggles helped as little as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">screams. "Push down your release switch, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">idiot," roared Irvine. I could have kicked myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why didn't I at least think of that simple thing?</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Hicks stood there, pale as cheese, except for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the large smears of fuller's earth on his face, fum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">(Continued on page 512)</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bundle of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. ...

Dr. Jarvis, seeing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">physician of the insurance company, whom he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, at the table, joined him as he packed a sheaf</seg><seg type="columnLine">of papers into a wallet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you make of it Fulton?" he questioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So far, we have learned nothing, Jarvis," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Fulton, slowly.

He left a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">estate too, as you probably know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Jarvis went home in a deep, brown study.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was shocked and horrified by the loss of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dearest friend. He could not reconcile the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this big, hearty person was the victim of blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">poison or shock. Why, the man had always been</seg><seg type="columnLine">immune. He had been proverbially tough, bubbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">oyer with vitality. "How had he lost that immu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nity?" he asked himself. He recalled their last</seg><seg type="columnLine">day together--the day before he had sailed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe.

But Jim Craig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head whipped his racquet up in a swift lawford and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ball, like a shot from a gun, sped down the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">line far from the doctor's reach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Damn," he cried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"trimmed 8 to 6 by a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fifty and I'm your</seg><seg type="columnLine">junior by ten years.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, the jewel in the setting, had light hair, neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden nor yellow, although with a touch of autumn</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheat; she was delicately featured, with an expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive mouth, inclined to be serious. Now, with these</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men, apparently happy and smiling, she revealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">very regular, white teeth. Ross Craighead was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most as tall as his adopted father but slender; Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wide shouldered and robust. The girl, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall, seemed diminutive beside these two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the beautiful girl and the handsome youth</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed well and full of vitality, Jim Craighead was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost insolent in his defiant heartiness. Ross</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the orphaned son of Craighead's sister who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">died when he was a few years old. The bond be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween these two was very strong--Ross was a sensi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive soul, of the artistic type, against which char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acteristic the buoyant Craighead had waged a losing</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight. The boy could not be hardened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At college he was all for humanities, classics,</seg><seg type="columnLine">science, logic, but close calculation in business</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have been left out of his nature. Sports</seg><seg type="columnLine">had attracted him--he was good material for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">teams, especially in baseball and swimming. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Craighead had determined that he would be hope-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less in the banking and brokerage operations which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he controlled, Ross had met Tessie Prettyman, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was secretary to Craighead's manager. Her effi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciency was due to the fact that she took every in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction seriously and obeyed implicitly. She be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved anything she was told, which was incon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venient when she was listening to a rival of the firm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Craighead was inclined to discourage the inti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">macy he saw growing between the pair but when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross began to grind earnestly at tasks Jim knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy loathed, he began to consider the girl less a</seg><seg type="columnLine">liability than an asset. She was an orphan, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all they knew of her history. But she was well</seg><seg type="columnLine">educated, a lady in all her actions, so that Jim soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew as fond of her as Ross. This, then, was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle which had been broken up by a tragedy so</seg><seg type="columnLine">unnecessary in Dr. Jarvis's mind as to be heart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like all healthy men--men who have never felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ache or a pain, Jim was virtually a baby when</seg><seg type="columnLine">some slight cut or other wound came in a tennis or</seg><seg type="columnLine">other game. Once Doctor Jarvis had found him</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking morphine. Jim had said, rather shame-</seg><seg type="columnLine">facedly :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's not a habit, Milt, but I just can't stand pain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've never had much, I guess that's the reason."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This last day he had seen Craighead, the recol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lection of which came to the doctor's mind over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over again, the young man had taken the front seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Tessie, while Jim and Doctor Jarvis sat in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jim, old man, I'll be missing you," said the doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor, as they left him at his apartment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll be waiting at the pier when you come back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Milt, twice as famous as you are now," was Jim's</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was like him. He had helped Doctor Jarvis</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his ea^ly difficulties and setbacks, encourag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him and rejoicing in his successes. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">foster father and pal in one. So Doctor Jarvis was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very impatient as his brain refused to accept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that Jim Craighead was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In no way could he reconcile his sturdy friend's</seg><seg type="columnLine">death with a theory that the shock of an operation</seg><seg type="columnLine">would kill him. His analysis was searching. Noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in his experience was overlooked. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">skilled in X-ray therapy as well as X-ray photogra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phy. His science was modern--the latest researches</seg><seg type="columnLine">were commonplaces to him. But facts were what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed, after all. No conclusions could be drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">from surmises. This thought drove him to the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Inspector Craven at headquarters. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">good friends, for the doctor had often given expert</seg><seg type="columnLine">testimony in trials in which the inspector was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Inspector," began Dr. Jarvis, "what do you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this Craighead inquest?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Doc," replied the inspector, settling his</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge frame back in a capacious chair, as he wrin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kled his thick brows and blew the smoke from a vile</seg><seg type="columnLine">smelling pipe through his walrus moustache, "in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quests are not much in our line unless there is some</seg><seg type="columnLine">crime involved. This is such a clear case of a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying from the shock of an operation that the police</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no more interest in it than the public. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course Craighead was a big man. I knew him well</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself. He used to stop here to pick me up some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times, so I got to know what an impatient chap he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. He told me that he'd sprint for a car, when-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever he had to ride on a street car, like any kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of seventeen. The insurance company would grab</seg><seg type="columnLine">at anything suspicious but nothing has come up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We all know the story. Craighead got too cocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his sprinting ability, and was run over. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mucky and rainy, so what followed was almost in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">evitable. Tough on the insurance companies, though.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doc Lawson seems positive that it was the shock of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the operation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is just why I don't feel satisfied," said Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jarvis. "Lawson is an old practitioner, a good sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geon, but very apt to make up his mind what killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his patient. The more you might show him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">probability of some other cause, the more stubbornly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would believe in his own theory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are quite a few of us like that, Doc,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled the inspector. "But, you knew the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">family. Is there anyone who could profit by Craig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head's death?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, there is Ross, Jim's adopted son and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nephew. But he had all the money he needed--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the business with Jim. Then, too, Jim made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no secret of the fact that his fortune was to go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross. So I think that Ross is out of the question,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for they were devoted to each other. Ross is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idealistic type--he would be more apt to give money</seg><seg type="columnLine">away than try to get it by murder."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who else is there?" queried the inspector, indif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferently, for he could see no mystery in Craighead's</seg><seg type="columnLine">death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then," continued the doctor, "there is the girl to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom Ross is engaged, a perfectly innocent creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">who simply adored Jim--he treated her as if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">were already his daughter-in-law. She is an or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phan, Tessie Prettyman."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tessie Prettyman!" exploded Inspector Craven,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good Lord, Doctor Jarvis, do you know who Tessie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prettyman is?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, she has no family that we know of, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to be a very refined and charming little lady."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SHADOW ON THE SPARK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">501</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tc\T rELL," said the inspector, bouncing from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">VV chair, "Tessie Prettyman is a girl who has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been visiting Piggy Bill Hovey down in the Tombs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piggy Bill is held on a narcotic charge, without bail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he was caught with a large supply of mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phine, opium and heroin; the Federal boys want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find out where he gets that stuff because he can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be connected with any smuggling operations. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">men have watched the girl and she seems to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piggy Bill very well. Some of them think she is his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweetie. But if Piggy Bill is anywhere on the hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">izon, I am willing to be suspicious about Craighead's</seg><seg type="columnLine">death."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This revelation grated on Dr. Jarvis. He did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe for a moment that this sweet looking girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">had any criminal tendencies or was capable of play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing such a dual r61e as the affianced of Ross Craig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and the "sweetie" of a notorious criminal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Inspector," he said finally, "have you time to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the hospital with me? The records or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head nurse might tell us something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Time, time," roared Craven, "this is official busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness now. What we have to learn is how Piggy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill's sweetie happens to be engaged to marry Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Craighead's son. First thing, we'll go to the hos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pital, then we'll talk with this young man who seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be infatuated with Tessie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the inspector's big car it was a short trip to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hospital. The records told them nothing new.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was Dr. Lawson's case, so that whatever he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to say would be developed at the inquest. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the fact, suddenly unveiled, that Piggy Bill was</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere in this series of events, the inspector</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have remained seated in his big chair, se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">renely puffing on his pipe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doc," said the inspector, suddenly, "let's talk to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head nurse first, then we can look up the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and Tessie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Cornhill," asked the Doctor, when the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">nurse appeared, "did you see Mr. Craighead when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was brought into the hospital a few days ago?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Of course," replied the nurse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How did Mr. Craighead seem to you?" he queried</seg><seg type="columnLine">further.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doctor Jarvis," the nurse said, "Mr. Craighead</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very badly hurt. He was not a patient sufferer</seg><seg type="columnLine">--he stood the pain irritably and was relieved when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it became necessary to etherize him. He asked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor to give him a hypodermic a couple of times,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the doctor refused."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was like Jim." murmured Doctor Jarvis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But," continued the nurse, "he should not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">died from the operation under normal conditions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course his mental condition was very bad.

If it lies between Ross and Tessie, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess it may as well end where it is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See here, Doc," said the inspector, gripping Doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor Jarvis by the arm, "you've started me looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a murder or some crime and by the eternal, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not going to let any sentimentality about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty girl check our investigation until we know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there is or is not a crime."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Inspector," replied the Doctor, with a hard glint</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his eye, "as long as there is any &lt;' ubt as to how</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim died, I am with you to the end. 1 simply meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">to express my opinion that neither of those two</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be involved. Let us look the situation in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Dr. Lawson has certified that Jim Craighead</seg><seg type="columnLine">died of natural causes. That prevents any kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">action until the inquest reveals something of a sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picious nature. In fact, there would have been no</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquest but for the insistence of the insurance com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany. Now, we must develop something that points</seg><seg type="columnLine">to some unnatural factor in Jim's death before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquest is over."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's true enough," replied Craven, "and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't want to alarm anyone until we have the goods</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him. You be at the inquest bright and early</seg><seg type="columnLine">and keep your eyes and ears wide open. I will find</seg><seg type="columnLine">out when Tessie went to see Piggy Bill last and</seg><seg type="columnLine">join you later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The inspector left Doctor Jarvis at his door, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prey to many conflicting emotions. He had started</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery going which he knew could no longer be</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped. But he did not want to leave Ross open</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an insidious attack. His efforts to communicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him, however, were unavailing. After a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepless night the doctor refreshed himself with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a plunge, a shave, and then having dressed himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a sombre garb which fitted well with his present</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotions, went to the Coroner's court. It had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened with Dr. Lawson on the stand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now Doctor," began Mr. Bailey, representing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insurance company, "you were describing, yester-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, the nature of Mr. Craighead's injuries.

No one knew in what direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion the inquest was tending. Even to the coroner</seg><seg type="columnLine">this long rehearsal of symptoms without any avowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose seemed unnecessarily delayed. Inspector</seg><seg type="columnLine">Craven's presence puzzled him.

He was not a drug addict, but he often said</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would take anything to drown pain. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened like a flash. I did not know that blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">poison could travel so fast. The night he died he</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SHADOW ON THE SPARK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">503</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">took an opiate and seemed drowsy, so that I said I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would lie down for a moment or two. He took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle in which was a colorless liquid and poui'ed</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of it into a glass of milk. He was half asleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, so I went to my room while he was drinking it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he often took a glass of milk in that fashion. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had very little sleep for two or three days and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozed off at once with all my clothing on. I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have slept more than a quarter of an hour when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was awakened by a crash. It was the crash of</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking glass, as I learned an instant later. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed into his room to see him breathing his last.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had overturned the table on which were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottles of medicine. But what a terrible sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted my eyes! His hands, arms, legs twitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shot out from second to second, then before I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could even call for help he had a convulsion and</seg><seg type="columnLine">died. I called Dr. Lawson. It seemed an eternity</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he answered. Miss Pretty man had heard my</seg><seg type="columnLine">cries and she was with me. Dr. Lawson asked if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had taken anything besides the medicine he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had prescribed. I said yes, he had taken a hypo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dermic and some other opiate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''The hopeless fool," he cried. "I warned him</seg><seg type="columnLine">against that very thing. He practically killed him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. The shock of the operation was enough at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he reached the house, he said it was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late to do anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you look at the bottles on the floor?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lawyer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir," replied Ross. "They were all thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">together in a broken heap--they had been on a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">table at his bedside. In his struggles, he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have overturned them. Oh, it was terrible, terrible."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here, the young man buried his head in his arms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking with the power of his emotions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Inspector," said Dr. Jarvis, "that young man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">describing a death from strychnine poisoning. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">must find out where that strychnine came from.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Look at that girl now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The inspector followed his gaze to where Tessie</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat. She was obviously horror stricken. A look</seg><seg type="columnLine">of despair crept into her face as she followed Ross's</seg><seg type="columnLine">descent from the stand. Ross was about to go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her side but at a sign from the inspector an officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">took him by the arm, leading him to a chair near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspector. His heart sank as he caught that look</seg><seg type="columnLine">of despair on the girl's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EVERY actor in the drama was apparently in</seg><seg type="columnLine">court. Dr. Jarvis had caught the inspector's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fever for a man hunt. It was now a cold problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">of science. He was not a judge, merely an instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of justice. No longer was there a thought in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind, any more than in that of the inspector,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that any person should be shielded. He was going,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from now on, to let the chips fall where they would.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Inspector," he said, "the whole situation now</seg><seg type="columnLine">depends on how much that girl knows. I am going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ask Mr. Bailey to put me on the stand. I see</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly how the affair was managed, but T haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest idea of who planned or executed it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anyway, when I get through, if Ross or Tessie had</seg><seg type="columnLine">any hand in it, they will talk better than if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were subjected to the third degree. I am talking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of murder now; when I am through, it will be your</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair to bring the guilty person to justice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "H'm," mused the inspector a second, as if in</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt, then posted his men with orders to let no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one leave the court room until he gave the signal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There might be others," he reflected, "so why</seg><seg type="columnLine">not bag them all?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Jarvis now stepped to the table where coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sel and doctors sat. After a few whispered words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Bailey rose to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Coroner," he said, "one of our most promi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent physicians, an acknowledged authority and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the closest friend of the deceased, is our next wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. His testimony may clear up some of our dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficulties."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pursued rarely are ignorant that they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursued. As the lawyer concluded his announce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Tessie half rose to her feet, but an officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced her back into her chair. She realized then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was in custody. She had indeed, divined be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore that the inquest had taken a threatening turn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross dully watched the progress of events thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">how he might shield her from persecution. Lovers</seg><seg type="columnLine">are impersonal. The world is outside. To him, Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Craighead was still alive. Suspicion did not enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind. It did not occur to him that he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be suspected of murder. Still less did he conceive</seg><seg type="columnLine">that anyone would accuse of complicity in a mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, the girl, who to him, was the impersonation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">innocence. That a net of some evil omen was weav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about them was too evident to be ignored. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature, however, was a mystery to him. Yet when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor, a man whom he knew for the devoted</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend of his foster father and, as he thought, also</seg><seg type="columnLine">of himself, got on the stand and began to speak in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sure, even voice, which seemed to brook no</seg><seg type="columnLine">contradiction, he looked somewhat hopefully at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamic figure. The doctor was a tail, slender man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">athletic and erect in appearance, with a firm, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tellectual face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Jarvis was sworn. He was then examined on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his various degrees, his experience, his scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other studies. Mr. Bailey, instead of asking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">series of questions, requested him to give any tes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">timony that might throw light on the death of Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Craighead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I would like you to bear patiently with what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have to say," began Dr. Jarvis, "interrupting, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you like, when I have not been sufficiently clear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for whatever questions you may care to put.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Singularly enough, the mysterious death of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best friend I have ever known ceases to be a mystery</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a remarkable scientific discovery which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must rehearse briefly. It is the relative size of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smallest bodies known to science. The structure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the atom has been analyzed. The atom is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smallest particle of matter which can exist indepen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently. The elements which enter into the atom</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no existence apart from the atom. The atom</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the smallest particle of matter which can enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the structure of the molecule. But it is not in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">destructible. It has been broken up into its ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments. These consist of outer circulatory electrons</seg><seg type="columnLine">which are negative charges of electricity and a core</seg><seg type="columnLine">or nucleus composed of positively charged protons</seg><seg type="columnLine">and some electrons, all in balance. These electrons</seg><seg type="columnLine">are in constant motion within the atom, revolving</seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">about the nucleus much as the planets revolve about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Now, this discovery led to the measurements</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these tiny particles. Science wanted to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">more about the relative masses of atoms and mole-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cules. The electron is about one thousandth the</seg><seg type="columnLine">volume of the hydrogen atom. Do not think this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is all a pedantic discussion. You will see in a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">few momenta how very practical it all is.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The atom," continued Dr. Jarvis, "is invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the most powerful microscope. The mole-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cule is larger, but defies the microscope. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having gone thus far, science had to go further.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The next larger mass after the molecule, is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colloid. A colloid is a formless substance classified</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a slime. It never takes a definite form like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystalline substances. Solutions of gold can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">made in the two forms--there is a colloidal gold and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crystalline gold."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A look of stupefaction was on the faces of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspector, the coroner and all that vast throng in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the courtroom. Yet a pin could have been heard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it dropped during that tense silence. Back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these mystic words an enigma lay. That the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">would clear it up, his easy self assurance seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarantee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even the colloid practically baffles the micro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope. In the ordinary atmosphere, merely cloudy</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressions can be obtained. How then is the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sence of any of these tiny particles discovered? It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is very simple, when the method is disclosed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">colloid cannot be seen, but it makes a shadow on an</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric spark as it passes by. So when the presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a colloid is suspected, its shadow on an electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">spark betrays it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pardon me, Doctor, for interrupting you," broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bewildered Mr. Bailey, "but if this discussion</seg><seg type="columnLine">has any bearing on the death of Jim Craighead. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would like to know, if these particles you are talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about, are so small that they cannot be seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the strongest microscope, how it helps you any</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know they make a shadow on an electric spark.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact, how do you know they make a shadow on</seg><seg type="columnLine">an electric spark?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">«xrOU may have read at times, Mr. Bailey," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">I plied the doctor, "announcements that as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tronomers had located a star known through math-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ematical calculations to be at some point in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens, which the telescope has been unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrate. Well, the speed of light, which is 186,-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">000	miles a second, helps us. A photograph of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens will sometimes reveal something which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye could not see. So, a photographic plate will</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes catch the smaller particles as well as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">largest stars, too far away to be seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you consider the light as moving in waves it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is easier to understand what effect light waves have</seg><seg type="columnLine">on these discoveries.

While</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is known as the shock of an operation is due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a toxic condition, it is not what is technically</seg><seg type="columnLine">known as blood poison.

None of the cars stood more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a few seconds. While I stood there be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildered, staring at the doors of all the taxis, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped opposite me. The driver motioned to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then I noticed that the door had a coat of arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a figure nine. The traffic was stopped for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant. He opened the door for me to step in. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment I was in he closed the door and drove off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first I thought he was crazy, for he drove around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the block three times, then went over to Sixth Ave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nue and drove almost recklessly. After that, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned again two or three times and I recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broadway. We never left Broadway again until</seg><seg type="columnLine">we reached Tarrvtown. We passed a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine estates, and several towns, all new to me, for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never been so far on that road before. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did notice that we never turned until we had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tarrytown. Some distance beyond Tarrytown--it</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have been a few miles--the driver took a turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the left toward the river, until we came to quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woods. It looked like part of some big estate that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not been well kept or from which its owner had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been absent a long time.

The driver</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted the gate to let the car through, then closed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">again behind him. Some distance from the road,</seg><seg type="columnLine">well hidden in the trees, we came to a house, once</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tenanted house, but now looking very dilapidated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It did not seem a likely place for a drug store--</seg><seg type="columnLine">still I said nothing as my stepfather had directed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The car stopped and T stepped out. The driver</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked at the door twice, rather sharply. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one peered through a dust-covered window half</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed by rickety shutters. In a second or two the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door opened, the driver mumbled a few words and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were ushered into a strange room by a mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapen dwarf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was fitted up as a drug store--counters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelves filled with bottles, all labeled, graduate</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses such as you see in the hospital, rolls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandages, first aid kits and instruments. The drug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gist was a hunchback, who filled me with aversion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he merely held out his hand for the prescrip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, turning his hand to his bottles and glasses as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as I had given it to him. It was easy to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he wras a skilled apothecary by the way he han-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dled everything. When he had filled the prescrip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion he gave me a package. It contained a bottle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">colorless liquid which was labelled: 'Dose--ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">drops with milk or other liquid.' There was a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">box, too, labelled 'morphine.'

He drove back</seg><seg type="columnLine">along Broadway until he came to the city line. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told me that I could return along the subway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All this mystery so puzzled me that I determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see Bill again to learn if the prescription was</seg><seg type="columnLine">properly filled. When I saw Bill Hovey I showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the bottle. There were many bottles in his cell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was known to be a good chemist and worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the prison drug shop.

Assuming, as I do, that her</seg><seg type="columnLine">story is true, she would be placed in jeopardy, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men who tricked her were allowed to escape. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is possible to trap the druggist, who doubtless, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind warped by affliction, is capable of aiding as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sassins who use poison. If the court is willing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold this session open until I have had time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">verify this extraordinary tale and capture, if pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, the author of a diabolical plot, several unex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained murders of the same sort may be solved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But in order that no warning may be given, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">request you to make an order that no one leave this</seg><seg type="columnLine">court room until I return."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is an extraordinary request, Inspector Cra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ven," replied the coroner, "so extraordinary that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not know if I have so much arbitrary power.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before even deciding I must ask you a question to</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear up the young woman's story. Is it possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she visited this Hovey in prison and that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible for him to give her writing without de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tection ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When a man like Bill Hovey is captured, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coroner," answered the inspector, "he is often given</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great deal of apparent freedom in order that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">may betray his confederates, and also in a narcotic</seg><seg type="columnLine">case, that he may betray the hiding place of a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous drugs. It was even contemplated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">release Hovey and keep him under surveillance, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is so slippery a character that the plan was</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned as too risky. Two men were detailed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow the young woman on her visit to Hovey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were not clever enough for the job. The taxi</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver went three times around the block with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers two cars behind on his trail. The driver</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it. He drove around the block until he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the traffic signal about to change. He dashed across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street while the officers waited until the signal</seg><seg type="columnLine">was changed again. When they crossed the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">the taxi they were following had disappeared. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">taxi, as Miss Prettyman has related, did not return</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the city that night. When she returned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prison, the officers who were supposed to be watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her, were still looking for the taxicab, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they learned had turned into Broadway. This inci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent, however, will result in more stringent rules</seg><seg type="columnLine">and curtailment of prisoners' privileges.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cctttHAT I propose to do is this," continued In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">» ' spector Craven. "I propose to take Tessie</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Doctor Jarvis with me to Tarrytown. Unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has been warned, the druggist will be awaiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">news. Two men from this room are in custody.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There may be others posted here.

Yet no prescriptions for</seg><seg type="columnLine">those poisons have been found nor has the source</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them been traced. Here we have two desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">men skilled in toxicology with a supply of danger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous substances."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The coroner hesitated no longer. Rising from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, he pronounced his decree:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As the presiding officer of this court I hereby</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoin and forbid any person to leave this court-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room until the return of Inspector Craven or until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has advised the Court from Tarrytown, which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">require him to do the instant he has accomplished</seg><seg type="columnLine">or failed to accomplish his mission."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An additional detail of officers had arrived. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a few murmurs against this exercise of auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cratic power, yet the murmurs were soft, for there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no spectator of the unexpected turn of events</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the courtroom, who did not want to be present at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the denouement. Some openly believed the girl was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying. Others quite vehemently espoused her cause.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Obviously the hours would not be dull in the court</seg><seg type="columnLine">room until the party returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl, a picture of abject despair, sat at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of her affianced lover, uncertain of a future</seg><seg type="columnLine">which only a few days before seemed rosy with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn of hope. Turning to her, the inspector said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tessie, you must show the way to the druggist</seg><seg type="columnLine">near Tarrytown. It means freedom and vindication</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you and Ross if we verify your words. Doctor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we can find that prescription, it will need more</seg><seg type="columnLine">Latin than I ever knew to decipher it. Ross, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think it is coming out right--as right as it can."</seg><seg type="columnLine">To this Ross made no reply. He pressed Tessie's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand in farewell, then the trio left the courtroom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of curious eyes following them. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">women whispered as Tessie passed them:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good luck, dearie!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inspector Craven, not daring to trust himself, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he remarked to the doctor, took one of his men along</seg><seg type="columnLine">as chauffeur. He feared that he would drive too</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast for safety. So he said to the officer:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tarrytown, Beronio, at the best you can get out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The automobile had a riot car siren, but it is safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">to assert that no riot car ever ran like that one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were few curves to make and with a few ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptions, the road was perfectly straight all the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The car could run at a speed of over sixty. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran very nearly that the entire distance. As they</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced along the highway, Tessie felt the universe</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipping from her. The thought of what place in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world might be hers when this nightmare was</seg><seg type="columnLine">over terrified her. The doctor read some of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought from her expression and, trying to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">her talk pointed out objects along the road--a diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult task, with the car dashing along so that tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone and telegraph posts almost resembled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">picket fence. She replied in monosyllables. Finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mustn't worry so much, my child. What is</seg><seg type="columnLine">your anxiety, now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh," she cried, gulping to keep down a sob, "if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hunchback has taken alarm and gone away, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">will become of Ross and me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The shack will still be there, won't it? That</seg><seg type="columnLine">will confirm part of your story," said the doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These words bewildered the trembling young</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'You don't believe, then, that I gave him poison</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliberately?" she faltered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I would need more proof than we have now,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered Dr. Jarvis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To this enigmatic reply there was no response.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SHADOW ON THE SPARK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">509</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They were not long in reaching Tarrytown, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inspector Craven turned to Tessie, saying:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You had better keep your eyes open now for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place where you turned off the main road. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedometer says 52 now; if your guess of the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance is accurate, we should run much slower."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beronio ran the car more slowly for three miles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Tessie did not recognize the turn. Nearing four</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles, as the inspector was beginning to be assailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by doubts, she said suddenly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just beyond here, I remember, is the cross road.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This gateway with the two stone lions at each side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened as we passed--a car coming out delayed us</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment. It should be less than a city block</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE inspector felt almost cheerful when, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet farther on, another road crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the left, Beronio," he ordered, "when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to the trees take the wagon trail and go just</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short distance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inspector Craven said these words fatuously, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man who has learned a lesson in which he has not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest belief, who has been told to memorize</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first fifty lines and mumbles the words like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking doll. They were all unnerved as the final</seg><seg type="columnLine">test approached. Mentally, the inspector blamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor who had led him into a fool journey like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this. Tessie was in a panic, fearing the escape of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dwarf. Dr. Jarvis alone seemed unconcerned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His tall fiprure, erect and commanding, his lips com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed in a firm, straight, uncompromising line,</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressed no doubt whatever. The car stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Jarvis was the first to get out. Inspector</seg><seg type="columnLine">Craven was at his side in an instant. Beronio</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the crazily hanging gate and ran his car</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the shelter of the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How far did you go into the woods, Tessie?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked the inspector.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Possibly four or five blocks," replied the girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Beronio, give the doctor your gun," ordered In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spector Craven. "He may need it. Lead on Tessie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but go softly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The evening was coming on, the autumn air was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool and damp in the neglected woods, weedy, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick undergrowth; it was difficult to think of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">house of any sort there. Yet they followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, breathlessly, almost treading on her heels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Five hundred yards they trudged along the winding</seg><seg type="columnLine">path when Tessie stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look," she whispered, pointing to the right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both men followed her glance, seeing with relief</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dilapidated tenant house, to all appearances un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied, save for an almost imperceptible thin line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smoke which was just visible above the broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the chimney. The door was closed, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">would probably offer no formidable obstacle. Shut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters hung crazily over the one window which opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the front of the house. They were half closed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">held by a bit of soiled ribbon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doc," whispered the inspector, "I am going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">slip over to the door. If anyone tries to drop out</seg><seg type="columnLine">by that side window, use your gun. If any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hovey's gang is about, they won't mince matters."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inspector Craven was himself, now. The house</seg><seg type="columnLine">was here, that was certain. Stealthily he moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the door. Unperceived, he gained the door-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">way, where he stood for a moment listening for</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs of life. Finally he heard a clinking of glass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very faint tinkling. He put his big shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the door. It was bolted and resisted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">first assault. He thought no longer of who might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be inside and with a mighty impact, burst the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">open. As he almost fell over the threshold, a shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">rang out and a twinge in the left shoulder told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a good shot. But he fired at the flash, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was followed by a cry of pain. He had hit his</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy in the gun arm. There was light enough for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Craven to see a hunchback, who stood looking wick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly at the gun which covered him. The instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reports rang out Doctor Jarvis and Tessie had</seg><seg type="columnLine">run to the door of the shanty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you hurt, inspector?" asked Jarvis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He winged me in the left shoulder," said Craven</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly. "If I had not stumbled when the door gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">way it would have been worse, for it was well aimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the heart. Pretty lookin' bird, ain't he? Is he</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one who filled the prescription, Tessie?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," replied the girl, while the dwarf looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her malevolently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A small fire burned in an open stove. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor, seeing the blood on Inspector Craven's coat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to examine him to learn the extent of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">injury, the hunchback, with a quick movement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped a bundle of papers spiked on a file and</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw them into the stove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The prescriptions, the prescriptions!" cried Tes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sie, in a panic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FORGETTING his wound, the inspector leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the hunchback, felling him to the floor with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy blow from the butt of his revolver. He sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor, motionless. Doctor Jarvis had darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the stove from which he retrieved the sheaf of</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers, little the worse from the flames except</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the hot coals had singed the edges. The doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor's fingers suffered most from contact with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">embers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tessie," said the inspector, nursing his wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, "run through those papers. See if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can find anything that looks like the prescription</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill Hovey gave you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eagerly enough, now, she lifted one sheet after</seg><seg type="columnLine">another from the file. Not far from the top she</seg><seg type="columnLine">came on one which she examined carefully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is it," she said, holding it out for Dr. Jarvis</seg><seg type="columnLine">to read. His professional instincts, however, over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came his curiosity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Inspector," he cried, somewhat shamefacedly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">remorseful for neglect toward a wounded friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"let us have a look at that shoulder first."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It hurts like the devil," said Inspector Craven,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but that bird is stirring, so safety first. Take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of handcuffs out of my pocket and snap them</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his wrists. He would blow us all up and himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, if he got the chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Jarvis secured the misshapen dwarf, clumsily</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, then looked at his wound. The dwarf's arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bleeding. Without too great delay, for he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">much more worried over the inspector than over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">misshapen druggist, he bound the wound tightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prevent further bleeding. In all this commotion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although he stirred, the man did not regain con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness. He had been dealt a stiff blow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The inspector was not seriously wounded. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">510</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet fired by the hunchback, from a vicious little</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic .25 had gone straight through the shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der muscles, severing the smaller blood vessels. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a matter of a few minutes to dress the wound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Craven was impatient to learn the truth. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">they found the prescription? If they had, his wound</seg><seg type="columnLine">mattered little. If not, he was a fool. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a melodrama of a coroner's investigation. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">without cause, he was a zany. With cause, he pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served his self-respect at least.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Doc," he said, as soon as the bandage was drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight and a tourniquet applied, "see what kind of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist Piggy Bill writes. If it's the literature the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady says, I'll bet it against Shakespeare."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Doctor Jarvis then spread the paper Tessie had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given him on the counter, while Tessie and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspector leaned over his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The first paragraph calls for morphine and sco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">polamin,'' said he. "But scopolamin has no virtue</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a surgical case. But wait," he added, "there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. My God, what infamy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For a moment he was speechless, then began read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing words incomprehensible to his hearers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Monsieur et cher amiwas the salutation, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the following words: "C'est bien drole que le</seg><seg type="columnLine">mot 'scopolamin' et le mot qui exprime l'extrait de</seg><seg type="columnLine">la noix vomique ont la meme total; il serait bien</seg><seg type="columnLine">dommage si Ton prendrait l'un pour l'autre."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What does it all mean?" asked Inspector Craven.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well," answered the doctor, "it is not medical</seg><seg type="columnLine">Latin nor any other kind of Latin. It is written in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly good French, not at all difficult to follow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is how it reads: 'My dear friend: it is very</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious that the word "scopolamin" and the word</seg><seg type="columnLine">which signifies the extract of nux vomica have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same number of letters. It would be sad if one</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistook the one for the other.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That was why he told Tessie scopolamin would</seg><seg type="columnLine">help Craighead. It happened to have the same num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of letters the way he spelled it (without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'e') as strychnine. Strychnine is an alkaloid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nux vomica. He knew Tessie was ignorant of</seg><seg type="columnLine">French--the rest was easy. But I don't understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he hoped to gain by it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What, a hard-boiled guy like that?" shouted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspector. "Hell, he needed $10,000. If Tessie got</seg><seg type="columnLine">married he would send for her and tell the story</seg><seg type="columnLine">counting on her fear to see that he got enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay the lawyer who guaranteed to get him out. Why.</seg><seg type="columnLine">this bunch saw Tessie paying blackmail for murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next ten years." Then turning to the girl, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Tessie, you have our compliments. I hope for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune will smile on you. This has been a terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordeal for a young girl."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Indeed," sobbed the girl, as reaction set in, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not care about fortune, now. How can I live,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing that I helped kill my benefactor, the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was as much a father to me as my own might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been had he lived."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The doctor took the bundle of prescriptions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a number of vials containing prohibited drugs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">narcotics and toxic substances, they returned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car, the doctor forcing the hideous looking dwarf to</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk beside him. They found his name to be Tim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">othy Clegg, from one of the prescriptions. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundled into the car and the return journey to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metropolis began. At Tarrytown, the inspector</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped long enough to have a couple of officers sent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TTTP</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to guard the drug store hidden in the woods, so that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">no evidence might be destroyed. In the prescrip-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tions were enough orders for deadly poisons, signed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by Piggy Bill Hovey, to damn him many times over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The proof in the Craighead case was convincing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Inspector Craven then telephoned the coroner of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the success of their mission. Beronio returned to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">town in more leisurely fashion. When they arrived</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the Coroner's Court with their prisoner and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inspector showing the evidences of a battle, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scene that followed beggared all description. Hand-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cuffed and heavily guarded, the dwarf sullenly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">glared at his captors. Inspector Craven, despite his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wound, took the stand. He described their journey</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in complete detail, verifying Tessie's story. Calls</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for order failed to check the applause for the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">DR. JARVIS followed the inspector. He identi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fied the prescription, and gave its hideous im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">port so vividly that the spectators shuddered. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">jury took but a few minutes to render a verdict.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As the verdict was announced, a finely dressed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">woman murmured audibly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What a monstrous injustice! That young man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inherits all his father's wealth, although he helped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to kill him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She was one of Jim Craighead's numerous cousins</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and chagrined that his big estate was beyond her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reach. Ross Cragihead was too far away to hear</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her remark, but she heard his reply breathlessly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for he rose to his feet, before the crowd, dazed by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the rapid turn of events. He took hold of Tessie's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">arm, and stood near the coroner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I want to say to you, Mr. Coroner, publicly," he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">began, "to Dr. Jarvis and to Inspector Craven, that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">after what has been revealed here today, it is im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">possible for me to take one penny from my father's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">estate. His will makes Dr. Jarvis executor and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gives him certain powers of distribution, in case I,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for any reason, do not succeed to the property.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Since I, however innocently, was, with Tessie, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">instrument of his death, the money would come to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me stained with blood. Yet this tragedy has knitted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the fate of Tessie and myself in an indissoluble</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">way. With what we have, we leave this city tonight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--we shall be married at once. Then we shall go</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">far from this place of dreadful memories to live as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">best we can, what life has in store for us. If we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are free, we will go at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You are free," said the coroner. "All the evi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dence is now on record."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The crowd moved aside to let them pass. As they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">moved toward the door, the girl clutched with both</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hands, the arm of her partner in crime. Unwilling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">criminals!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The dwarf was never tried. He was found dead</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in his cell the next morning, despite the careful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">guard set to prevent his suicide. A small capsule in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his mouth showed that he was always prepared for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the possibility of capture. Piggy Bill died myste-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">riously before any charge was presented against</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him. "Suicide," remarked Inspector Craven, "as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Webster once said, is confession."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A year later. Dr. Jarvis received an announcement</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from Sydney. Australia, telling of the birth of "Jim</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Craighead, Second."

"It won't work," the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventor wailed. "Something has gone wrong with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the system.

Go and cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">the juice off, I tell you!

Redoubled shrieks of agony made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">desist from his Christian endeavor. I drew my</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch. Only one minute was over. Would that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool never be able to cut off the juice? "I got it!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelled Hicks, as we heard the switch of a button.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At once I felt that something was wrong, wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">--very much wrong again. I did not know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was. Yes, I did. It was the water rising on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. Did I say just a while ago it was funny how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the human mind acts? You know, the first thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought of was the professor. "Cut it out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hicks," I roared, "you will drown him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will," came back the despairing cry of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inventor. "I will, I will, I will! But I can't. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is something radically wrong here. Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be wrong, I am sure,--I know something is</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong!" and he went into a spasm of working with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the switchboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I TOO thought that something must be wrong.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meanwhile the water was rising at the rate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">about half an inch a second. I took only a short men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal calculation to see that within less than a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">it must be above the professor's mouth and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still a minute and a half to go before the release</seg><seg type="columnLine">would act. I pride myself on quick thinking in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergency. Near the dish washing machine I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen a piece of large rubber hose. I made a dash for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, splashing through the water, which was now half</seg><seg type="columnLine">a foot deep. I got back just in time. "Take this</seg><seg type="columnLine">in your mouth, professor, and quit your roaring, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will drown," I screamed in his ears. Some in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinct told him I was right and he did as he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">told. In a few seconds the water was up over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, but he was breathing through the hose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get out of here, the rest of you, or there may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the devil to pay!" I ordered. "You can't do the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor any good and the water is rising. Get out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To her honor it must be said that the prim Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peak remained. "I'll stay with you to the end, dear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hold your hand," she crooned over the rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters--for the professor was beyond hearing. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the water the brushes were working with un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diminished speed, raising little gurgling eddies to</seg><seg type="columnLine">testify to their action. The rest of the company</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashed through the inundation, which was by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time a foot and a half deep, toward the front room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With difficulty, they opened the door and instantly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt the outward rush of water, while the level fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">several inches in the kitchen to start rising again</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon after. All of a sudden I heard screams of ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror. "Hold the hose," I ordered Miss Peak, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed,--or rather sloshed, toward the front room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There I beheld a sight I will never forget. The fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">niture had been shifted to one side, blocking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. The water was two feet high. Irvine was</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing on a table--did I tell you before that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">always was a coward? Smith and his wife, my aunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the inventor were in various attitudes of pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tration in the water, and every time one tried to rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would suddenly sit down. He would get up, make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a step, and kerplunk! sit down in the water. "Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing is murdering us, O'Keefe," roared Smith. "Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is biting me," screamed Aunt Eulalia. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment I was bewildered, dumbfounded. Why didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">they stay up? Then the truth flashed upon me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That confounded Automatic Carpet Sweeper was</seg><seg type="columnLine">there under the water, rushing back and forth, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was mowing down the people as fast as they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">get up. "All get up on the table!" I shrieked, "or</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will be killed." Evidently they were ready for</seg><seg type="columnLine">any advice, for they scrambled out over the chairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on the table with an alacrity begotten of des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peration. They could all just find room on it. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that moment all the furniture made a quick move</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if galvanized, moving toward the opposite end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room, and all five sat down in the lake below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Screams and curses instantly rent the air. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">again was that confounded suction sweeper, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer sucking, but running all the same along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, knocking the unfortunate people down as fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they managed to rise. "Get back on the table," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellowed, and at that moment, remembering the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor's plight, I rushed back. By this time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water was three feet deep and was getting close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the hose. But thank goodness, there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">only twenty seconds left until the release would</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. During the stress of excitement, a life seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded into seconds. And did you ever notice how</seg><seg type="columnLine">during a serious crisis, you will do unimportant</seg><seg type="columnLine">things? Perhaps I needed a mental rest, for just</seg><seg type="columnLine">then I saw the Automatic Egg Beater in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. It flashed through my thoughts that Hicks had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that it ran at a speed of 15000 R.P.M. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be interesting to see that spindle go. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was my chance. I could do nothing until the release</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked--why not put time to good use? All these</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts crowded themselves into that brief mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. I bent down close to the beater to observe</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way the spindle acted, and pressed the button.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The egg-beater started like a gun. A lock of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair was sucked in and wrapped around the high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed spindle. In a hundredth part of the tick of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollar watch my head was pulled up until my fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head rubbed it. There was a brief moment of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated agony, a feeling as if my head would ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plode, and three solid handsful of my hair, pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">out by the roots, were distributed over the surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings. I turned off the switch. My mind was cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so was my forehead of every vestige of hirsute</seg><seg type="columnLine">adornment, while a little stream of blood slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">trickled down over my nose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">r- -&gt;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">✓ T.

The plots, I felt, were excellent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Visitation" was fairly well written, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is an extremely difficult task to successfully bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">a story to a climax in the way that more expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rienced writers seem able to. In this respect I</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel that "The Electronic Wall," and "The Fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Poseidonia" fell Hat. I. however, am</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely pointing this out. I, in spite of this, found</seg><seg type="columnLine">these stories very interesting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now about the other stories so far published.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In "The Mad Planet" it was pointed out that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased carbon dioxide content of the air caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">extraordinary fungus growths, and corresponding</seg><seg type="columnLine">insect development. Now. it is a well known fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fungi use the oxygen and excrete carbon</seg><seg type="columnLine">dioxide as a waste, while green plants, though they</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not require carbon dioxide, use quantities of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the process of photo-synthesis in excess to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carbon dioxide excreted by the cells themselves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore, since green plants need more carbon</seg><seg type="columnLine">dioxide than oxygen, an excess of this gas in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air would tend to stimulate green plants, and since</seg><seg type="columnLine">fungi use more oxygen than carbon dioxide, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">excess of carbon dioxide would tend to discourage</seg><seg type="columnLine">fungus growth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In reference to insects versus mamals in a car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bon dioxide laden atmosphere--insects breathe</seg><seg type="columnLine">through trache, air circulating without use of defi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nite muscles or regular contractions, while ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals breathe through lungs, with a definite set of</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles. Now. it is known, and even applied (in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case of artificial resuscitation, where carbon</seg><seg type="columnLine">dioxide is mixed in fairly large, rather, relatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">large quantities, with pure oxygen) that carbon</seg><seg type="columnLine">dioxide, when not mixed with organic impurities</seg><seg type="columnLine">(as given off by the lungs) stimulates the muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lungs. This would, in turn, speed up mam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alian and reptilian life generally, while insects,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having no lung muscles, could not be so stimulated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I enjoyed the story greatly, and, as nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the world is perfect. I am eagerly looking for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward to more stories by the author. I like all</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories, but I wish to emphasize that good author-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship is necessary to put over an idea in an inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esting manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, word pictures are difficult, when of imag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inary objects, to "get."

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine makes the reader get his mind off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyday hurly-burly of life and takes him into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the realms of science. Such stories as '¥Dff on 3</seg><seg type="columnLine">Comet," "The Man from the Atom." "A Trip to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Center of the Earth," and "Station X." bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reader into the more intimate secrets of nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">and give him a taste of real true science.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Amazing Stories has a great uplifting effect on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reader.
