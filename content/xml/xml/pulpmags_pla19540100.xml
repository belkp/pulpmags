    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dear Editor,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pardon my grammar and realize the point which I would make</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clear. In a recent issue Alfreda Runyon had a meritorious Icttec</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">THE VIZIGRAPH</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">run. She put into words what should be in civiliza-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tion's modes and morals. I shall epitomize her views,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Sex is not ugly except to the neurotic mind." The</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fact that generations of ignorance and superstition</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">has debased man's attitude toward sex into some-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">thing far less than God intended it is no where</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">more evident than in the science of Psychology. (1</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">consider the latter a science even though learned men</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">do not.) Evidence has been put forth that sexual</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mania propensities are mostly artificially induced.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In that forgotten era when sex became thought of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">as evil, to be kept clandestine, man made his greatest,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">egregious blunder. In his blind, stupid haste for its</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">condemnation he even forgot to label it clearly. As</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">any semanticist will confirm, the word "sex" is im-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">possible to define universally. Another interesting</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fact about the symbolic representation of sex is that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the words describing sex are almost all of a derog-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">atory nature.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Sex is mortality. Perhaps man has built up all</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the taboos on sex because he wishes to conceal the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fact of his mortality. If that be the reason then man</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">should realize by now that the noxious effects from</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">such a childish notion are too great for its continua-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When 1 see various magazines displaying the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">human form in different stages of nudity 1 both</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">condemn and condone them. While they are putting</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">into practice what I advocate, their motives are too</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">selfish to eulogize.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I understand the difficulty in making a good cover.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Circulation demands that cheesecake be displayed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">enticingly. Now, personally, I do not have anydiing</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">against seeing the cover girl stripped naked in an</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">intelligently planned painting. But when a beautiful</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">body is thrown into a space merely for mercenary</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">reasons, that seems nothing short of sacrilegious.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Anderson is an inveterate doer of just that. Of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">course I realize that Pulp covers are not meant to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">be artistic masterpieces, but that does not mean</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">they should be meaningless things of form, color</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and line.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Why not have Wood do a cover. Though he is</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">known chiefly as a cartoonist, I think he could rank</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">with Finlay if given an opportunity. All I can see</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">wrong with his art is that he gives unnecessary</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">details, and chronically draws his figures too short</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and stocky.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Sometimes I think God made the critic so the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">artist could suffer enough to be creative.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">If anyone wishes to question my viewpoints on</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sex, just take off your shoes and wade in, but</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">remember the water is deep.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Why is everybody so set against Bryan Berry. As</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he said himself he does not rate such a deluge of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">comment. His works are not that good or bad. And</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to say that his style is similar to Ray Bradbury is</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">as ridiculous as inferring that Zane Grey wrote</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">like Victor Hugo.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In both the July and September issues James</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">that I cannot conceive why it should ever be printed.</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">all the future families of this one particular</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mouse are destroyed, right?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Right."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And all the families of the families of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tiie families of that one mouse! With ft</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stamp of your foot, you annihilate first one,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">then a dozen, then a thousand, a million,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a billion possible mice!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"So they're dead," said Eckels. "So</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">what?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"So what?" Travis snorted quietly.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Well, what about the foxes that'll need</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">those mice to survive? For want of ten mice,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a fox dies. For want of ten foxes, a lion</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">starves. For want of a lion, all manner of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">insects, vultures, infinite billions of life</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">forms are thrown into chaos and destruc-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tion. Eventually it all boils down to this:</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fifty-nine million years later, a cave man,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">one of a dozen on the entire world, goes</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hunting wild boar or saber-tooth tiger for</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">food.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But you, friend, have stepped on all</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the tigers in that region. By stepping on one</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">single mouse. So the cave man starves. And</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the cave man, please note, is not just any</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">expendable man, no! He is an entire future</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nation. From his loins would have sprung</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ten sons. From their loins one hundred sons,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and thus onward to a civilization. Destroy</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">this one man, and you destroy a race, a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">people, an entire history of life. It is com-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">parable to slaying some of Adam's grand-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">children. The stomp of your foot, on one</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mouse, could start an earthquake, the effects</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of which could shake our earth and destinies</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">down through Time, to their very founda-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tions.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"With the death of that one cave man,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a billion others yet unborn are throttled in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the womb. Perhaps Rome never rises on its</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">seven hills. Perhaps Europe is forever a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dark forest, and only Asia waxes healthy</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and teeming. Step on a mouse and you crush</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the Pyramids. Step on a mouse and you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">leave your print, like a Grand Canyon,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">across Eternity. Queen Elizabeth might</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">never be born, Washington might not cross</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the Delaware, there might never be a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">United States at all. So be careful. Stay on</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the Path. Never step off!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I see," said Eckels. "Then it wouldn't</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">"/CORRECT. Crushing certain plants</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">When I find one that's going to die when</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">Then I correlate our arrival in the Past so</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that we meet the Monster not more than</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">cate .watchmaker's claws close to its oily</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">reptilian chest. Each lower leg was a piston,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a thousand pounds of white bone, sunk in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">thick ropes of muscle, sheathed over in a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">gleam of pebbled skin like the mail of a</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">great breathing cage of the upper body</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">those two delicate arms dangled out front,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">arms with hands which might pick up and</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">sculptured stone, lifted easily upon the sky.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Its mouth gaped, exposing a fence of teeth</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">like daggers. Its eyes rolled, ostrich eggs,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">empty of all expression save hunger. It</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">closed its mouth in a death grin. It ran, its</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pelvic bones crushing aside trees and bushes,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">its taloned feet clawing damp earth, leaving</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">prints six inches deep wherever it settled</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">its weight. It ran with a gliding ballet step,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">far too poised and balanced for its ten tons.</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">so that the entire body seemed to twitch and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">undulate, even while the monster itself did</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">not move. It exhaled. The stink of raw flesh</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">blew down the wilderness.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Get me out of here," said Eckels. "It</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Monster, at the first motion, lunged</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">forward with a terrible scream. It covered</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">one hundred yards in four seconds. The</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">rifles jerked up and blazed fire. A wind-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">storm from the beast's mouth engulfed them</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in the stench of slime and old blood. The</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Monster roared, teeth glittering with sun.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Eckels, not looking back, walked blindly</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to the edge of the Path, his gun limp in his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">arms, stepped off the Path, and walked, not</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">knowing it, in the jungle. His feet sank into</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">green moss. His legs moved him, and he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">felt alone and remote from the events</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">behind.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The rifles cracked again. Their sound was</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">sideways. Trees exploded in clouds of leaf</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">to twist them in half, to crush them like</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">berries, to cram them into its teeth and its</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">screaming throat. Its boulder-stone eyes</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">leveled with the men. They saw themselves</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I had watched for some two or three min-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">utes, entirely forgetting my own safety,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">when the she saw me. Its eyes widened and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it snatched up the alarm clock which was,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">as I have hinted, near at hand.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Get out of here, you nosey old tin can!"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it screamed, and threw the clock, which</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">caromed off my headpiece, damaging one</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">earphone. I ran.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">If you still do not see what I mean about</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">racial prejudice, you will, when you hear</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">what happened later.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I continued on until I came to Benny's</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Place, entering through the back door.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Benny met me there, and quickly shushed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">me into a side room. His fluorescent eyes</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">were glowing with excitement.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Benny's real name is BNE-96, and when</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">on Earth he had been only a Servitor, not</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a General Purpose like myself.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But perhaps I should explain.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We metal people are the children of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Builders of Earth, and later of Mars and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Venus. We were not born of two parents,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">as they are. That is a function far too com-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">plex to explain here; in fact I do not even</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">understand it myself. No, we were born of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the hands and intellects of the greatest of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">their scientists, and for this reason it might</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">be natural to suppose that we, and not they,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">would be considered a superior race. It is</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">not so.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Many of us were fashioned in those days,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a metal peison for every kind of task that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">they could devise, and some, like myself,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">who could do almost anything. We were</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">contented enough, for the greater part, but</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the scientists kept creating, always striving</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to better their former efforts.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And one day the situation which the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Builders had always regarded as inevitable,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">but we, somehow, had supposed would</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">never come, was upon us. The first genera-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tion of the metal people--more than fifty</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">thousand of us--were obsolete. The things</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that we had been designed to do, the new</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ones, with their crystalline brains, fresh,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">untarnished, accomplished better.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We were banished to Phobos, dreary,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">lifeless moon of Mars. It had long been a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sort of interplanetary junkyard; now it be-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">came a graveyard.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">UPON the barren face of this little world</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">there was no life except for the handful</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of hardy Martian and Ter ran prospectors</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">who searched for minerals. Later on, a few</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">rude mining communities sprang up under</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">plastic airdromes, but never came to much.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Argon City was such a place.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I wonder if you can comprehend the lone-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">liness, the hollow futility of our plight.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Fifty thousand skilled workmen with noth-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing to do. Some of the less adaptable gave</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">up, prostrating themselves upon the bare</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">rocks until their joints froze from lack.of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">use, and their works corroded. Others served</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the miners and prospectors, but their needs</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">were all too few.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The overwhelming majority of us were</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">still idle, and somehow we learned the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">secret of racial existence at last. We learned</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to serve each other.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">This was not an easy lesson to learn. In</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the first place there must be motivation in-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">volved in racial preservation. Yet we de-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">rived no pleasure out of the things that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">make the Builders wish to continue to live.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">We did not sleep; we did not eat, and we</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">were not able to reproduce ourselves. (And,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">besides, this latter, as I have indicated,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">would have been pointless with us.)</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was, however, one other pleasure</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of the Builders that intrigued us. It can best</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">be described as a stimulation produced by</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">drenching their insides with alcoholic com-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pounds, and is a universal pastime among</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the males and many of die shes.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">One of us--R-47, I think it was (rest</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him)--tried it one day. He pried open the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">top of his helmet and poured an entire bot-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">B-12'* MOON GLOW</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">15</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tic of the fluid down his mechanism.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Poor R-47. He caught fire and blazed up</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in a glorious blue flame that we could not</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">extinguish in time. He was beyond repair,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and we were forced to scrap him.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But his was not a sacrifice in vain. He had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">established an idea in our ennui-bursting</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">minds. An idea which led to the discovery</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of Moon Glow. My discovery, I should say,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">for I was the first.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Naturally, I cannot divulge my secret</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">formula for Moon Glow. There are many</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">kinds of Moon Glow these days, but there</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">is still only one B-12 Moon Glow.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Suffice it to say that it is a high octane</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">preparation, only a drop of which--but you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">know the effects of Moon Glow, of course.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">How the merest thimbleful, when judi-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ciously poured into one's power pack, gives</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">new life and the most deliriously happy</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">freedom of movement imaginable. One</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">possesses soaring spirits and super-strength.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Old, rusted joints move freely once more,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">one's transitors glow brightly, and the cur-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">rents of the body race about with the mi-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nutest resistance. Moon Glow is like being</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">born again.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The sale of it has been illegal for several</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">years, for no reason that I can think of ex-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cept that the Builders, who make the laws,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">can not bear to see metal people have fun.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Of course, a part of the blame rests on</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">such individuals as X-101, who, when lu-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">bricated with Moon Glow, insists upon</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dancing around on large, cast-iron feet to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the hazard of all toes in his vicinity. He is</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">thin and long jointed, and he goes "creak,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">creak," in a weird, sing-song fashion as he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dances. It is a shameful, ludicrous sight.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then there was DC-5, who tore down the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">300 feet long equipment hangar of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Builders one night. He had over-indulged.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">I DO not feel responsible for these things.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">If I had not sold them the Moon Glow,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">someone else would have done so. Besides,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">I am only a wholesaler. Benny buys every-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">thing that I am able to produce in my little</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">laboratory hidden out in the Dumps.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Just now, by Benny's attitude, I knew that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">something was very wrong. "What is the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">matter?" I said. "Is it the revenue agents?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I do not know," said BNE-96 in that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">curious, flat voice of his that is incapable of</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">inflection. "I do not know, but there are</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">visitors of importance from Earth. It could</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mean anything, but I have a premonition of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">disaster. Jon tipped me off,"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He meant Jon Rogeson, of course, who</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was the peace officer here in Argon City, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the only one of the Builders I had ever mot</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">who did not look down upon a metal per-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">son. When sober he was a clever person who</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">always looked out for our interests here.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'What are they like?" I asked in some</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fear, for I had six vials of Moon Glow with</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">me at the moment.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I have not seen them, but there is one</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">who is high in the government, and his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">wife. There are half a dozen others of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Builder race, and one of the new type metai</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">persons."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I had met the she who must have been</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the wife. "They hate us," I said. "We can</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">expect only evil from these persons."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You may be right. If you have any mer-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">chandise with you, I will take it, but do not</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">risk bringing more here until they have</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">gone."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I produced the vials of Moon Glow, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he paid me in Phobos credits, which are</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">good for a specified number of refueling*</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">at the Central fueling station.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Benny put the vials away and he went</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">into the bar. There was the usual jostling</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">crowd of hard-bitten Earth miners, and of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the metal people who come to lose their</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">loneliness. I recognized many, though I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">spend very little time in these places, pre-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ferring solitary pursuits, such as the distilla-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tion of Moon Glow, and improving my</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mind by study and contemplation out in the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">barrens.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jon Rogeson and I saw each other at the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">same time, and I did not like the expression</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in his eye as he crooked a finger at me. f</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">went over to his table. He was pleasant look-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing, as Builders go, with blue eyes less dull</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">than most, and a brown, unruly topknot of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hair such as is universally affected by them.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Sit down," he invited, revealing his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">white incisors in greeting.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I never sit, but this time I did so, to be</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">polite. I was wary; ready for anything, I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">knew that there was something unpleasant</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in the air. I wondered if he had seen me</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">passing the Moon Glow to Benny somehow.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Perhaps he had barrier-penetrating vision,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">16</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">like the Z group of metal people . . . but I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had never heard of a Builder like that. I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">knew that he had long suspected that I made</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Moon Glow.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What do you want?" I asked cautiously.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Come on now," he said, "loosen up!</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Limber those stainless steel hinges of yours</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and be friendly."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">That made me feel good. Actually, I am</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">somewhat pitted with rust, but he never</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">seems to notice, for he is like that. I felt</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">young, as if I had partaken of my own</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">product.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The fact is, B-12," he said, "I want you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to do me a favor, old pal."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And what is that?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps you have heard that there is</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">some big brass from Earth visiting Phobos</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">this week."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I have heard nothing," I said. It is often</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">helpful to appear ignorant when questioned</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">by die Builders, for they believe us to be</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">incapable of misrepresenting the truth. The</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fact is, though it is an acquired trait, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">not built into us, we General Purposes can</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">lie as well as anyone.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well, there is. A Federation Senator,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">no less. Simon F. Langley. It's my job to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">keep them entertained; that's where you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">come in."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I was mystified. I had never heard of tl}is</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Langley, but I know what entertainment is.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">I had a mental image of myself singing or</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dancing before the Senator's party. But I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">can not sing very well, for three of my voice</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">reeds are broken and have never been re-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">placed, and lateral motion, for me, is almost</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">impossible these days. "I do not know what</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">you mean," I said. "There is J-66. He was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">once an Entertainment--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No, no!" he interrupted, "you don't get</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it. What the Senator wants is a guide.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">They're making a survey of the Dumps,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">though I'll be damned if I can find out why.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">And you know the Dumps better than any</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">metal person--or human--on Phobos."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">So that was it. I felt a vague dread, a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">premonition of disaster. I had such feelings</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">before, and usually with reason. This too,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was an acquired sensibility, I am sure. For</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">many years I have studied the Builders, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">there is much to be learned of their mobile</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">faces and their eyes. In Jon's eyes, however,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">I read no trickery--nothing.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Yet, I say, I had the sensation of evil, It</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was just for a moment; no longer.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I said I would think it over.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ENATOR LANGLEY was distin-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">guished. Jon said so. And yet he was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cumbersomely round, and he rattled inces-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">santly of things into which I could interpret</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">no meaning. The she who was his wife was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">much younger, and sullen, and unpleasantly</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">I sensed great rapport between her and Jon</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Rogeson from the very first.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There were several other humans in the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">group--I will not call them Builders, for I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">did not hold them to be, in any way, supe-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">rior to my own people. They all wore spec-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tacles, and they gravitated about the round</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">body of the Senator like minor moons, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">I could tell that they were some kind of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">servitors'.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I will not describe them further.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">. MS-33 I will describe. I felt an uncon-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">scionable hatred for him at once. I can not</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">say why, except that he hung about his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">master obsequiously, power pack smoothly</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">purring, and he was slim limbed, nickel-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">plated, and wore, I thought, a smug ex-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pression on his viziplate. He represented the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">new order; the ones who had displaced us</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">on Earth. He knew too much, and showed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it at every opportunity.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We did not go far that first morning. The</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">Dumps. Within the Dumps one walks--or</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">does not go. Phobos is an airless world, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">yet so small that rockets are impractical. The</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">terrain is broken and littered with the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">refuse of half a dozen worlds, but the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Dumps themselves--that is different.</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Imagine, if you can, an endless vista of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">death, a sea of rusting corpses of space</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ships, and worn-out mining machinery, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of those of my race whose power packs</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">burned out, or who simply gave up, retiring</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">into tliis endless, corroding limbo of the</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">seen.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But this fat ghoul, Langley, sickened me.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">This shame of the Builder race, this atavism</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">--this beast--rubbed his fat, impractical</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hands together with an ungod-Iike glee.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Excellent," he said. "Far, far better, in</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">17</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I looked at Jon Rogeson. He shook his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">head slowly.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You there--robot!" said Langley, look-</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">The word was like a blow. I could not an-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">MS-33, glistening in the dying light of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Mars, strode over to me, clanking heavily</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">up on the black rocks. He seized me with</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his grapples and shook me until my wiring</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was in danger of shorting out. "Speak up</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">when you are spoken to, archaic mech-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">anism!" he grated.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I would have struck out at him, but what</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">use except to warp my own aging limbs.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jon Rogeson came to my rescue. "On</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Phobos," he explained to Langley, "we</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">don't use that word 'robot.' These folk</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">have been free a long time. They've quite</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a culture of their own nowadays, and they</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">like to be called 'metal people.' As a return</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">courtesy, they refer to us humans as 'build-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ers.' Just a custom, Senator, but if you want</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to £et along with them--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">' Can they vote?" said Langley, grinning</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">at his own sour humor.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Nonsense," said MS-33. "I am a robot,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and proud of it. This rusty piece has no call</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to put on airs."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">* Release him," Langley said. "Droll fel-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">lows, these discarded robots. Really nothing</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">but mechanical dolls, you know, but I think</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the old scientists made a mistake, giving</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">them such human appearance, and such ob-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stinate traits."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Oh, it was true enough, from his point</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of view. We had been mechanical dolls at</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">first, I suppose, but fifty years can change</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">one. All I know is this: we are people; we</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">think and feel, and are happy and sad, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">uite often we are borea stiff with this</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">reary moon of Phobos.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It seared me. My selenium cells throbbed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">white hot within the shell of my frame, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">I made up my mind that I would learn more</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">about the mission of this Langley, and I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">would get even with MS-33 even if they</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had me dismantled for it.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Of die rest of that week I recall few</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pleasant moments. We went out every day,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and the quick-eyed servants of Langley</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">measured the areas with their instruments,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and exchanged significant looks from be-</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">2--Pianet--January</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hind their spectacles, smug in their thin air</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">helmets. It was all very mysterious. And</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">disturbing.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But I could discover nothing about their</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mission. And when I questioned MS-33, he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">would look important and say nothing.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Somehow it seemed vital that I find out what</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was going on before it was too late.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">On the third day there was a strange oc-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">currence. My friend, Jon Rogeson had been</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">taking pictures of the Dumps. Langley and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his wife had withdrawn to one side and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">were talking in low tones to one another.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Quite thoughtlessly Jon turned the lens on</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">them and clicked the shutter.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Langley became rust-red throughout the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">vast expanse of his neck and face. "Here!"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he said, "what are you doing?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Nothing," said Jon.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You took a picture of me," snarled</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Langley. "Give me the plate at once."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jon Rogerson got a bit red himself. He</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was not used to being ordered around. "I'll</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">be damned if I will," he said.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Langley growled something I couldn't un-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">derstand, and turned his back on us. The</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">she who was called his wife looked startled</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and worried. Her eyes were beseeching as</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">she looked at Jon. A message there, but I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">could not read it. Jon looked away.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Langley started walking back to the half-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">track alone. He turned once and there was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">evil in his gaze as he looked at Jon. "You</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">will lose your job for this impertinence," he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">said with quiet savagery, and added, enig-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">matically, "not that there will be a job after</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">this week anyway."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Builders may appear to act without rea-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">son, but there is always a motivation some-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">where in their complex brains, if one can</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">only find it, either in the seat of reason, or</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in the labyrinthine inhibitions from their</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">childhood. I knew this, because I had studied</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">them, and now there were certain notions</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that came into my brain which, even if I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">could not prove them, were no less inter-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">esting for that.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">THE time had come to act. I could</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">scarcely wait for darkness to come.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">There were tilings in my brain that appalled</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">me, but I was now certain that I had been</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">right. Something was about to happen to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Phobos, to all of us here--I knew not what.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">18 PLANE 2</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but I must prevent it somehow.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I kept in the shadows of the shabby build-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ings of Argon City, and I found the win*</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dow without effort. The place where I had</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spied upon the wife of Langley to my sor-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">row the other night. There was no one there;</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there was darkness within, but that did not</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deter me.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Within the airdrome which covers Argon</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">City the buildings are loosely constructed,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">even as they are on Earth. I had no trouble,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">therefore, opening the window. I swung a</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">leg up and was presently within the dark-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ened room. I found the door I sought and</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">entered cautiously. In this adjacent compart-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment I made a thorough search but I did</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not find what I primarily sought--namely</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the elusive reason for Langley's visit to</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Phobos. It was in a metallic overnight bag</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that I did find something else which made</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my power pack hum so loudly that I was</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">afraid of being heard. The thing which ex-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plained the strangeness of the pompous Sen-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ator's attitude today--which explained, in</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">short, many things, and caused my brain</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to race with new ideas.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I put the thing in my chest container, and</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">left as stealthily as I had come. There had</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been progress, but since I had not found</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what I hoped to find, I must now try my</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">alternate plan.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Two hours later I found the one I sought,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and made sure that I was seen by him. Then</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I left Argon City by the South lock, fur-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tively, as a thief, always glancing over my</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, and when I made certain that I</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was being followed, I went swiftly, and it</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was not long before I was clambering over</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the first heaps of debris at the edge of the</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dumps.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Once I thought I heard footsteps behind</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">me, but when I looked back there was no</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">one in sight. Just the tiny disk of Deimos</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">peering over the sharp peak of the nearest</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ridge, the black velvet sky outlining the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">curvature of this airless moon.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Presently I was in sight of home, the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">time-eaten hull of an ancient star freighter</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">resting near the top of a heap of junked</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">equipment from some old strip mining op-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">eration. It would never rise again, but its</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">shell remained strong enough to shelter my</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">distillery and scant furnishings from any</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">chance meteorite that might fall.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I greeted it with the usual warmth of</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feeling which one has for the safe and the</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">familiar. I stumbled over tin fuel cans,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wires and other tangled metal In my haste</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to get there.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">^ It was just as I had left it. The heating</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">element under the network of coils and</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ressure chambers still glowed with white</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eat, and the Moon Glow was dripping</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with musical sound into the retort.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I felt good. No one ever bothered me</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">here. This was my fortress, with all that I</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cafed for inside. My tools, my work, my</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">micro-library. And yet I had deliberately--</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Something--a heavy foot--clanked upon</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the first step of the manport through which</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I had entered.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I turned quickly. The form shimmered</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the pale Deimoslight that silhouetted it.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">MS-33.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He had followed me here.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What do you want?" I said. "What are</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you doing here?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"A simple question," said MS-33. "To-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">night you looked very suspicious when you</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">left Argon City. I saw you and followed you</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">here. You may as well know that I have</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">never trusted you. AH the old ones were</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unreliable. That is why you were replaced."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He came in, boldly, without being in-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vited, and looked around. I detected a sneer</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">^is voice as he said, "So this is where you</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hide."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I do not hide. I live here, it is true."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"A robot does not live. A robot exists.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We newer models do not require shelter</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like an animal. We are rust-proof and in-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vulnerable." He strode over to my micro-li-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brary, several racks of carefully arranged</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spools, and fingered them irreverently.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"W'hat is this?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"My library."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"So! Our memories are built into us. We</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">have no need to refresh them."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"So is mine," I said. "But I would learn</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">more than I know." I was stalling for time,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">waiting until he made the right opening.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Nonsense," he said. "I know why you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stay out here in the Dumps, masterless. I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">have heard of the forbidden drug that ii</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sold in the mining camps such as Argon</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">City. Is this the mechanism?" He pointed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">at the still.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Now was the time. I mustered all my</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">19</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">cunning, but I could not speak. Not yet.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Never mind," he said. "I can see that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it is. I shall report you, of course. It will</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">give me great pleasure to see you dis-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mantled. Not that it really matters, of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">course--now."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There it was again. The same frightening</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">allusion that Langley had maae today. I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">must succeed!</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">I KNEW that MS-33, for all his brilliance,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and newness, and vaunted superiority,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was only a Secretarial. For the age of spe-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cialism was upon Earth, and General Pur-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pose models were no longer made. That was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">why we were different here on Phobos. It</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was why we had survived. The old ones had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">given us something special which the new</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">metal people did not have. Moreover, MS-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">33 had his weakness. He was larger, strong-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">er, faster than me, but I doubted that he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">could be devious.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You are right," I said, pretending resig-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nation. "This is my distillery. It is where I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">make the fluid which is called Moon Glow</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">by the metal people of Phobos. Doubtless</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">you are interested in learning how it works."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Not even remotely interested," he said.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"I am interested only in taking you back</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and turning you over to the authorities."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It works much like the conventional dis-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tilling plants of Earth," I said, "except that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the basic ingredient, a silicon compound,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">is irradiated as it passes through zirconium</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tubes to the heating pile, where it is acti-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">vated and broken down into the droplets of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the elixir called Moon Glow. You see the</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It has the excellent flavor of fine petro-</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">is not really bad at all. Perhaps you could</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">persuade yourself to be more lenient with</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">me."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Certainly not," said MS-33.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps you are right," I said after a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">moment of reflection. I took a syringe, drew</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">up several drops of the stuff and squirted</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it into my carapace, where it would do the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">most good. I felt much better.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," I continued, "certainly you are</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">quite correct, now that I think of it. You</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">newer models would never bear it. You</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">weren't built to stand such things. Nor, for</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that matter, could you comprehend the ex-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">quisite joys that are derived from Moon</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Glow. Not only would you derive no pleas-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ure from it, but it would corrode your</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">parts, I imagine, until you could scarcely</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">crawl back to your master for repairs." I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">helped myself to another liberal portion.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">* That is the silliest thing I've ever</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">heard," he said.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I said, it's silly. We are constructed to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">withstand a hundred times greater stress,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and twice as many chemical actions as you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">were. Nothing could hurt us. Besides, it</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">looks harmless enough. I doubt that it is</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hardly anything at all."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"For me it is not," I admitted. "But</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">you--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Give me the syringe, fool!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I dare not."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Give it here!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I allowed him to wrest it from my grasp.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">In any case I could not have prevented him.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">He shoved me backwards against the rusty</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">bulkhead with a clang. He pushed the noz-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">zle of the syringe down into the retort and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">withdrew it filled with Moon Glow. He</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">opened an inspection plate in his ventral</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">region and squirted himself generously.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was quite a dose. He waited for a mo-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ment. "I feel nothing," he said finally. "I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">do not believe it is anything more than com-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mon lubricating oil." He was silent for</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">another moment. "There is an ease of move-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ment," he said.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No paralysis?" I asked.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Paral--? You stupid, rusty old robot!"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">He helped himself to another syringeful</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of Moon Glow. The stuff brought twenty</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">credits an ounce, but I did not begrudge it</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He flexed his superbly articulated joints</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in three directions, and I could hear his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">power unit building up within him to a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">whining pitch. He took a shuffling sidestep,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and then another, gazing down at his feet,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">with arms akimbo.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The light gravity here is superb, superb,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">superb, superb, superb," he said, skipping a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">bit.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Isn't it?" I said.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Almost negligible," he said.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"True."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You have been very kind to me," MS-33</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">20</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">said. "Extremely, extraordinarily, incompar-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ably, incalculably kind." He used up all the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">adjectives in his memory pack. "I wonder</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">if you would mind awfully much if--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Not at all," I said, "Help yourself. By</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the way, friend, would you mind telling</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">me what your real mission of your party</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">is here on Phobos. The Senator forgot to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">say."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Secret," he said. "Horribly top secret. As</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a dutiful subject--I mean servant--of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Earth, I could not, of course, divulge it to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">anyone. If I could--" his neon eyes glis-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tened, "if I could, you would, of course, be</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the first to know. The very first." He threw</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">one nickel-plated arm about my shoulder.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I see," I said, "and just what is it that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">you are not allowed to tell me?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why, that we are making a preliminary</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">survey here on Phobos, of course, to de-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">termine whether or not it is worthwhile to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">send salvage for scrap. Earth is short of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">metals, and it depends upon what the old</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ma--the master says in his report."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You mean they'll take all the derelict</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">spaceships, such as this one, and all the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">abandoned equipment?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And the r-robots," MS-33 said, "They're</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">metal too, you know."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"They're going to take the dismantled</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">robots?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">MS-33 made a sweeping gesture.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"They're going to take all the r-robots,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dismantled or not. They're not good for</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">anything anyway. The bill is up before the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Federation Congress right now. And it will</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pass if my master, Langley says so." He pat-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ted my helmet, consolingly, his grapples</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">clanking. "If you were worth a damn, you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">know--" he concluded sorrowfully.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That's murder," I said. And I meant it.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Man's inhumanity to metal people, I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">thought. Yes--to man, even if we were</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">made of metal.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How's that?" said MS-33 foggily.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Have another drop of Moon Glow," I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">said. "I've got to get hack to Argon City."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">I MADE it back to Benny's place without</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">incident. I had never moved so swiftly.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">I sent Benny out to find Jon Rogeson, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">presently he brought him back.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I told Rogeson what MS-33 had said,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">watching his reaction carefully. I could not</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">forget that though he had been our friend,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he was still one of the Builders, a human</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">who thought as humans.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You comprehend," I said grimly, "that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">one word of this will bring an uprising of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fifty-thousand metal people which can be</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">put down only at much expense and with</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">great destruction. We are free people. The</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Builders exiled us here, and therefore lost</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">their claim to us. We have as much right'to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">life as anyone, and we do not wish to be</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">melted up and made into printing presses</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and space ships and the like."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The damn fools," Jon said softly. "Lis-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ten, B-12, you've got to believe me. I didn't</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">know a thine about this, though I've sus-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pected something was up. I'm on your side,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">but what are we going to do? Maybe they'll</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">listen to reason. Vera--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That is the name of the she? No, they</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">will not listen to reason. They hate us." I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">recalled with bitterness the episode of alarm</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">clock. "There is a chance, however. I have</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">not been idle this night. If you will go get</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Langley and meet me in the back room here</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">at Benny's, we will talk."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But he'll be asleep."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Awaken him," I said. "Get him here.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Your own job is at stake as well, remem-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I'll get him," Jon said grimly. "Wait</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">here."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I went over to the bar where Benny was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">serving the miners. Benny had always been</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">my friend. Jon was my friend, too, but he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was a Builder. I wanted one of my own</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">people to know what was going on, just in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">case something happened to me.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We were talking there, in low tones,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">when I saw MS-33. He came in through the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">front door, and there was purposefulness</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in his stride that had not been there when I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">left him back at the old hulk. The effects of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the Moon Glow had worn off much quicker</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">than I had expected. He had come for venge-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ance. He would tell about my distillery,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and that would be the end of me. There</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was only one thing to do and I must do it</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fast.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Quick," I ordered Benny. "Douse the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">lights." He complied. The place was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">plunged into darkness. I knew that It was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">darkness and yet, you comprehend, 1 still</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sensed everything in the place, for I had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">B-12'8 moon glow</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">21</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the special visual sensory system bequeathed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">only to the General Purposes of a bygone</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">age. I could see, but hardly anyone else</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">could. I worked swiftly, and I got what I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was after in a very short time. I ducked out</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of the front door with it and threw it in a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">silvery arc as far as I could hurl it. It was an</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">intricate little thing which could not, I am</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sure, have been duplicated on the entire</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">moon of Phobos.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When I returned, someone had put the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">lights back on, but it didn't matter now.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">MS-3 3 was sitting at one of the tables, star-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing fixedly at me. He said nothing. Benny</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was motioning for me to come into the back</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">room. I went to him.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jon Rogeson and Langley were there.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Langley looked irritated. He was mumbling</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">strangled curses and rubbing his eyes.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Rogeson laughed. "You may be interested</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in knowing, B-12, that I had to arrest him</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to get him here. This had better be good."</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">' It is all bad," I said, "very bad--but nec-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">essary." I turned to Langley. "It is said that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">your present survey is being made with the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">purpose of condemning all of Phobos, the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dead and the living alike, to the blast fur*</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">naces and the metal shops of Earth. Is this</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">true?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why you impudent, miserable piece of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tinl What if I am making a scrap survey?</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">What are you going to do about it. You're</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nothing but a ro--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"So it is true! But you will tell the sal-</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">and you will decide that we are not worth</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">bothering with here on Phobos. You will</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">save us."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I?" blustered Langley.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You will." I took the thing out of my</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">breastplate container and showed it to him.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">He grew pale.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jon said, "Well, I'll be damned!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was a picture of Langley and another.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">I gave it to Jon. "His wife," I said. "His</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">real wife. I am sure of it, for you will note</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the inscription on the bottom."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Then Vera--?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Is not his wife. You wonder that he was</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Housebreaker!" roared Langley. "It's a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">plot; a dirty, reactionary plot!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It is what is called blackmail," I said.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">I turned to Jon. "I am correct about this?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You are." Jon said.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You are instructed to leave Phobos," I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">said to Langley, "and you will allow my</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">friend here to keep his job as peace officer,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">for without it he would be lost. I have ob-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">served that in these things the Builders are</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hardly more adaptable than their children,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the metal people. You will do all this, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in return, we will not send the picture that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Jon took today to your wife, nor otherwise</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">inform her of your transgression. For I am</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">told that this is a transgression."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It is indeed," agreed Jon gravely. "Right,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Langley?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"All right," Langley snarled. "You win.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">And the sooner I get out of this hole the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">better.'' He got up to go, squeezing his fat</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">form through the door into the bar, past</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the gaping miners and the metal people,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">heedless of the metal jpeople. We watched</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It is no business of mine," I said to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Jon, "but I have seen you look with longing</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">Since she does not belong to him, there is</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nothing to prevent you from having her.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Should not that make you happy?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Are you kidding?" he snarled.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Which proves that I have still much to</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Out front, Langley spied his metal ser-</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">doing here?" he asked suspiciously.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">MS-33 made no answer. He stared ma-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Come on here, damn you!" Langley said.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">MS-33 said nothing. Langley went over to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him and roared foul things into his ear-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">phones that would corrode one's soul, if</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">one had one. I shall never forget that mo-</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">the laughing miners.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But he got no reply from MS-33. Not</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">MASON was nervous. It was the nerv-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ousness of cold apprehension, not</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">simply that which had become in-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">digenous to his high-strung make-up. He</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was, in his way, afraid; afraid that he'd</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">again come up with a wrong answer.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He'd brought the tiny Scout too close to</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Rim. Facing the facts squarely, he knew,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">even as he fingered the stud that would</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wrench them out of their R-curve, that he'd</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not just come too close. He'd overshot en-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tirely. Pardonable, perhaps, from the view-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">point of the corps of scientists safely en-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sconced in their ponderous Mark VIi Ex-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plorer some fifteen light-days behind. But</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not according to the g-n manual. According</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to it, he'd placed the Scout and her small</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crew in a "situation of avoidable risk," and</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it would make a doubtful record look that</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much worse.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The next time he'd out-argue Cain with</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his rank if he had to. Cain was big enough</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to grab things with his brawny fists and</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">twist them into whatever shape he wanted</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when the things were tangible, solid, resist-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He materialized the Scout into E-Space,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">listened for trouble from her computers,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">but they chuckled softly on, keeping track</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of where they were, where they'd been, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">how they'd get home.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was as though nothing had happened.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">But Lieutenant Lansing Mason was still</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nervous, his slender fingers steady enough,</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A retort started at Mason's taut lips, but</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Here's a dope sheet from the comps, if</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">anybody's interested in knowing iust where</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">of the Large Magellanic Cloud." Sergeant</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Judith Kent's voice had its almost habitually</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">preoccupied tone, as though the words she</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">said were hardly more than incidental to a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">host of more important thoughts running</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">iwiftly behind her wide-set, deep gray eyes.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">They were serious eyes, and in their way</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">matched the solemn set of her small features</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and the crisp, military cut of her black hair</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and severe uniform.</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mason gave Cain's six-feet-two a quick</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">why the big redhead's shoulders always</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">seemed too broad for the Warrant Officer's</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stripes on them. "Sergeant Kent's right,"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he said. "Here's her comp-sheet. You can</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">look for yourself. Fringe, Magellanic. And</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">look at that while you can--'' he jabbed a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">forefinger at the main scanner, its screen</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">studded with unfamiliarly close constella-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tions--"because we're on our way back.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Set up a return on the comps, will you,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Sergeant?" For all his tenseness his voice</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was low, and the words it formed were even</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and swift.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Hell, Lance, this is the sort of stuff the</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Not out here they don't. R-drive when</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">you're ready, Sergeant!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Cain turned from the deep control bank</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and gave his full attention to the scanner as</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the -slender, efficient girl started feeding a</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tape of reversal co-ordinates into the com-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">puters.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mason waited the few necessary seconds,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pushed disarranged dark hair out of his eyes</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and felt the clammy dampness on his fore-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">head, and wTished silently to himself that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">opportunists like Cain were kept where they</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">belonged--on the Slam-Bang Run out of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">CalJisto. That's where the money was.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">That's where a Warrant like Cain ought to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">be.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Ready, sir," he heard Judith saying</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">quietly.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Hey, skipper!" There was a sudden</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">urgency in Cain's voice, and the equally</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sudden racket of an MPD alarm going off.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Cain was gesturing at the scanner, stubby</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">finger tracing a slewing pip of light. The</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">alarm stopped, and Judith's cool voice was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">relaying information. "About a thousand</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">miles," she was saying, "mass, approxi-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mately three hundred tons. Speed--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">BUT Mason wasn't listening. He was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">watching the pip of light as Cain got</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the scanner's directional going, tracked it.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Suddenly there were others coming as</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">though to meet it, and it swerved violently,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">obviously in flight. And now there were</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">more yet, this time from the starboard</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">quadrant of the screen.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Radiation reading, Sergeant!" Mason</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">clipped out.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">While the two men watched, Judith read</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">back the cryptic information interpolated by</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the ship's mass-proximity detector.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">That's not all engine junk!" Cain ex-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">claimed as she finished.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We don't know what drive they've got,"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Mason answered. "Could be anything--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Nuts! You wouldn't get that much from</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">an old-fashioned ion-blast, skipper! That's a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">shooting war, that's what it is!" There was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a glitter in Cain's narrowed brown eyes; a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">new edge on his heavy voice. "Which side</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">do we take, boss-man?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No side at all," Mason said, hardly</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">moving his lips. "We're getting the hell out</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of here."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Look, Lance. We've got a crew of ten</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">--we've got a couple of m-guns aboard</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">because we're a Scout. No telling how one</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of those outfits may show their gratitude if</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">we pitch in, help their side out. That's what</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">we're out here for, isn't it? Dig up new stuff</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">for the double-domes to sink their slide-</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">Hell, this is made to order--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mason turned a quick glance to the girl,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">but her face told him nothing. It never did</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">when things like this came up between him-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">self and Cain. And it was something he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">knew he had no right to expect. But he was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tired . . . too damn much Space, and there</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was nothing else he knew how to do.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But this time Cain had a point. Aliens--</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">extra-galactic, even if almost neighbors--</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and his help one way or the other could</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mean an engraved invitation, a key to the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">city.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He turned back to the screen, watched as</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the careening pips massed, mixed, whirled</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in an insensate jumble. He didn't want anv</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">more mistakes. They'd ground him for good,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tell him he'd had his limit of Space, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">park him on one of the rest-planets with a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pension for the rest of his life.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">No, he had to think, and quickly.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Earth had only too recently gotten an</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">entire history of wars out of her system.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Perhaps for good, this time. And that was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it; that was his answer. Better keep his nose</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">clean--</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"For God's sake, skipper," Cain snapped.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Come out of it! This is a natural, we'll</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">clean up!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Sergeant Kent! R-drive!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was a moment's sensation of noth-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ingness as the Scout made the Euclidean-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Riemannian Transition; the scanner paled</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and the segment of the universe it framed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">twisted, changed.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">- Cain didn't say anything. He glowered,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and Mason could feel the big man's con-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tempt. But he didn't have time for it.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">This time there wouldn't be any error.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">This time he'd be a step ahead of the situa-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tion and stay there. "Scratch those reversal</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">co-ordinates, Sergeant! Set up to diverge</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">thirty degrees!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Cain's sarcasm was little disguised. "Mind</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">if I ask a question?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Just stay at ease, Mister Cain, until</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">we're out of this!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mason watched the scanner's distorted</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">image as die Scout hurtled through a curved</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pencil of four-point Space; she didn't have</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a fraction of a powerful Explorer's speed,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and her small powerframe physically limited</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">her to that of light. Yet it could be fast</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">enough, for the aliens might know nothing</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of Transition technique, or could be as wary</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">as Earthmen of the Rim. His precautions</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">could be needless. But he had seen them and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">they were war-like, and he had no inten-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tion of being followed, either back to the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Explorer, or ultimately to Earth itself. He'd</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">have to maintain the diverged course until</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he was certain.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was a black pip on the fog-colored</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">scanner. Judith saw it even as he did. There</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was a fleeting look of fright on her intent</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">young face that she hadn't been able to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mask.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Cain saw it too,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You got a tail, skipper!" he said, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the grin was back on his big freckled face.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Cain was right. The alien was capable of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Transition. And he obviously had little fear</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of the Rim. His ship grew larger in the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">scanner.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mason felt his fingers grow cold again.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">LANCE told the girl to eject the tape</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of co-ordinates from the nav-compu-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ters, and he took over manually, hoping the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">comps would keep up. It would be up to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him where they went, and up to the comps</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to keep track of the Scout's position rela-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tive to both the Solar System and the Ex-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">plorer.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">His fingers played across the control -</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">banks as though the)' were the keyboards of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a great organ, and he felt his insides writhe</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">as he slipped the hurtling ship back into</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">E-Space, then back to R-level again. He</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">played the tiny craft between levels as</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">though it were a stone skipping across</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">water, and altered course with each Transi-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tion with no attempt at plan or pattern.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Rivulets of ice water trickled down across</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his ribs, and the flesh of his thin face was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stiff.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Wrong again," he heard Cain saying.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"At least we can tell the brain trust that</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">or two. At least those kids back there arc</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">playing around in this galaxy like it was</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he hadn't lost the alien; had known some-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mason didn't reply. He looked at the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">scanner, and now the alien craft was no</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">longer a dot, but taking definite shape. It</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">would be a couple of hours, yet, perhaps.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">And then it would have to be the way Cain</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had said.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The alien overhauled them hardly a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">billion miles inside the Rim, and Mason</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">offered no resistance when he felt their mag-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">netics touch the Scout and draw it gently to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the flank of their great ship. It was necessary</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to scale down the scanner's field to see the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">huge shape in its entirety. Beside it, the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Scout was like a sparrow's egg.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He punched the stud that would swing</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in the outer lock as the two craft touched</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">with but the slightest jar.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Cain's ham-like fists were knotted at his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sides, and Judith stood quietly, as though</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">waiting for nothing more than the presence</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of an inspecting officer. But her delicate face</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was white, and Mason wondered if the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">brain under that crisp, dark hair was still</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">functioning as a well disciplined piece of</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">machinery, or if it felt the same fear that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was in his own. He knew what was in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Cain's thoughts. But at least when he'd told</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">their small crew the score, they had accepted</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his decision--and his order to keep the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">m-guns where they were. So maybe this</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">time it was Cain who was wrong.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The three of them stood in the compact</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">confines of the control bubble, silent,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">waiting.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And when the alien stepped through their</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">inner airlock port and faced them, Mason</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">knew he was not succeeding in keeping his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">surprise from his features.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The alien could have been human. Even</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">clad in his Spacegear, he was little taller</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">than Cain, and his hair and eyes could have</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">been those of an Earthly Viking of another</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">day. Humanoid, so far as physical appear-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ances went. But in thought--?</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was a smile on the Viking face as</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the alien removed the transparent globe of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his helmet. He seemed to realize instinc-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tively that Mason was the Scout's com*</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mander.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I am Kriijorl," he said. *T extend the</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">right hand, Earth fashion, toward Mason!</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Lance grasped it as he tried to organize</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the sudden scramble of his thoughts. It was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a strong hand. He could feel the sinews of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it beneath its gauntlet; like Cain's, yet dif-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ferent, somehow. "You are peacefully re-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ceived, and welcome," he said. But there</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was a hollow sound to his words that he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had not been able to help.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The smile still played on the alien's sun-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Thank you. I hope that I use your</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">Mason found himself wondering how often</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That, for us, would be quite impos-</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">have successfully secreted refrigerated, lead-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sheathed stores of male sperm, quite impos-</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">Judith had kept the protests from reaching</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It had been the first time Mason had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">heard a hint of levity in her voice, and he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had liked it, and decided to take the assign-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ment gracefully. And, the orders said,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Sergeant Judith Kent went with the assign-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He hardly felt nervous at all as they</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Wonder how he made out?" he said idly,</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">"But I--I personally can't conceive of It,</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">Remember the time they had with those</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">Wanted to trade all the tritium we'd need</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to blow up a planet just for trees; because</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mason smiled. He was good looking</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">when he smiled and the Space-tension was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">gone from his slate colored eyes. "I remem-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ber. But it looks as though they're goin^ to</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">SHE smoked quietly, and her gray eyes</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">were thoughtful. "A matter of view-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">point, sir," she said finally. "As it always is.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">To them, females are for breeding only, to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">keep their war machine well stocked, rrom</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">what Kriijorl said, they do not understand</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You don't have to keep calling me sir'</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">like that!" Mason said, feeling a sudden</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">warmth at the back of his neck as he said it.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">And then, "Two centuries back. Yes. After</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">every war, Earth's birth rate would go crazy.</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"More wonder some men do--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mason looked up. But Judith's face was,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">as usual, quite calm and detached. "You say</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">something?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I said I'd like to have you get Kriijorl</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to demonstrate that teleprooe thing of hi*</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">for us, if you can, s-- Lance. How did he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">say it worked?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I still don't get it completely. A peculiar</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mixture of radio and the electroencephalo-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">graph, I think. He said it replaced radio on</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Ihelos and Thrayx centuries ago. You can</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">communicate to a group or an individual</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">with it in language, or in basic thought pic-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tures. That's what they use it mostly for, of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">course, and as such, it's termed a mentacom.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">But he told me that it can also be used as it</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was on us as a teleprobe when the subject</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">isn't screened. They use a specially tuned</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">carrier wave of some sort, he said, that im-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pinges on a diought wave pattern, but in-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stead of registering the pattern's electronic</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">impulse equivalents as does the electroen-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cephalograph, it 'reflects' them. Like a basic</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">radar system. And the receiver, it's a tiny</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">thing, breaks the reflected pattern down into</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">values equivalent to those in which the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">'listener' thinks; amplifies, and that s it!</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Mind reading made easy, I guess."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Judith squirmed a little uneasily. "I'm</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">glad they're not natural telepaths, anyway,"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">she answered. "And even with a gimmick</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">like that--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And then the conversation was lost as</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Kriijorl, flanked by two New-UN guides,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">strode from the building. The stiff breeze</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">at three hundred stories of what had once</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">been called Nob Hill flicked his scarlet</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">short-cape behind him and rippled the broad</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">front ot his black and silver tunic.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He climbed into the helio with a smiled</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">greeting, seated himself to Judith's right as</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he knew Earth custom demanded, and the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">craft was lifting slowly over the central</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">area of the ancient city before Mason spoke.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well, how did they treat you in there,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sir?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Not as well as I had hoped," Kriijorl</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">answered. "Your President-General spoke</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">with me privately after the World Delegates</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Council met to question me, and he held</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">out extremely little hope. However, the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">issue is to be debated. I think perhaps more</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">out of diplomatic courtesy than actual Con-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sideration. I am to be informed of the offi-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cial decision tomorrow. ..."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"There were scientists present, of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">course?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes; you have brilliant men on Earth,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant. They are good thinkers. I am</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">certain they were interested in me for more</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">than the sole fact that I am an alien of a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">race so precisely a replica of your own. But</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it is- again the old factor, cultural difference.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Your entire world simply regards women</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">differently than we. I imagine my request,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to persons less learned than those with</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">whom I spoke, would be quite shocking</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">anywhere on the planet."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps," Judith murmured. "Yet some-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">how I wonder. Somehow I wonder how</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">much two hundred years has really changed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">til. Our history in such things is not pleas-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ant, Kriijorl. Many of our women once gave</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">their bodies for money. Shock us? I'm not</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sure you really could. For your breeders</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">simply give their bodies to produce the flesh</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">for war. And there was a time when we did</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that, too."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was silence between them for</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a while, and then Lance began directing</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the Ihelian's attention to points of interest</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">as the air phase of the diplomatic tour got</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">under way.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The blue-green beauty of the Pacific</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stretched lazily below them from the color-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ful California shore line to the west. Sur-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">rounding air traffic was light, and the tour</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">proceeded smoothly eastward; over the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Great Divide, and then swung north.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Kriijorl seemed impressed and grateful for</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the momentary respite.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">IT WAS near the end of the tour's air</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">phase that Mason remembered Judith'3</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">request, and Kriijorl obliged with an</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">amused smile, producing a personal men-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tacom for Judith to examine.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And the receiver simply fits about the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">head like earphones?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Like this," Kriijorl said. They were</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nearing Denver, and air traffic at their level</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had picked up, and the helio was proceed-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing more slowly so that Kriijorl's demon-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stration caused him to miss little of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tour.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He fitted the compact headpiece to his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ears and flicked a small switch. It was sud-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">denly bathed in a warm orange glow. "This</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">way, the device functions as a limited range</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mentacom," he began. And then he flicked</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the switch again. "And now, as a teleprobe,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">you see, I could tell you, Lady Judith, just</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">what--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She flushed furiously, but Kriijorl had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">suddenly stopped speaking. His face had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">blanched, and a look of bewildered fury</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was suddenly in his eyes.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Lieutenant! That air bus! There!" He</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pointed to a thick egg shaped vehicle speed-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing to the north. 'Tell your chauffeur to</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">f&gt;ursue it at once! It carries a full passenger-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">oad of Earthwomen!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">For a moment Mason thought the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Ihelian was attempting some strange joke.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">But a look at the man's face told him that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">here was no joke; that here was something</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he was failing to understand.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Earthwomen? Sure--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Plus two other beings, Lieutenant. Two</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">others using Thrayxite probe screens!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">On Mason's order the government chauf-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">feur swiftly heeled the helio about. "Those</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">buses can make nearly a full Mach when</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">they're wide open like that one," he told</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Kriijorl. "We can't overtake them, but</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">maybe we can keep up. I'll have the chauf-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">feur try for radio contact--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No, no! They'll be alert for any signs</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of awareness of their presence! Wait--"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">The Ihelian made a third adjustment on</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the mentacom, and it emitted a slight hum-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ming sound, and the orange glow vanished.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"This will screen us for a short period, at</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">least," he said. "And if weVe not been</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">already detected, perhaps we'll be able to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">follow. If you'll continue to help me,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Looks as though they've got some of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ours, doesn't it?" Mason said evenly. There</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">SI</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">was a strange heat in his veins now, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">with the Ihelian, his nervousness was some-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">how evaporated. "But how the devil--"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"They are clever, Lieutenant. We were</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">somehow followed here even as we at first</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">followed you in your Scout ship. We may</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">aboard our screened destroyer."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But you said nothing about destroying</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">their breeders," Judith said above the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">throbbing roar of the helio's fast acceler-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ating jets. "Why would they want--" and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">she let the sentence die as comprehension</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">snapped in her gray eyes. Her dark, slender</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">eyebrows arched nearly together as she</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pushed the thought further.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The borderlands of Canada sped beneath</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">them, and then there was pine forest, but</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the helio kept the fleeing bus in sight even</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">as the shadows of a dying day crept inex-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">orably from the east to engulf them. And</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">then, abruptly, the bus had started down.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'They're hanging a neat frame on you,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sir," Mason said. "Making certain you don't</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">get the women you ask. By kidnaping some,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">they plan sure as hell to make it look as</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">though Ihelian desperation is responsible.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">And bingo, your side's in the dog house in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nothing flat. No deal!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"They're damnably cunning," Kriijorl</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">said. "It will not be the first time they have</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">come near making utter fools of us. I can't</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">understand that."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But how would they have gotten those</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">women?" Judith asked. The helio was slant-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing downward, and was now less than five</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">miles distant from the fast vanishing bus.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">It began to skim the tree tops of a great</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tract of spruce, its chauffeur awaiting</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Mason's signal to drop quickly out of their</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">quarry's line of sight.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Video ads, of course," Mason answered</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">quickly, straining his tensed eyes to estimate</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">distance in the fast gathering darkness.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Some big deal. Spaceliner hostess at twice</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the going rate of payment. Anything like</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that. ..."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The bus finally vanished less than a half-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mile ahead of Mason's helio, and there was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a dark vertical shadow jutting just above</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the tree tops. He knew it was one of their</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">shuttle boats, and from its apparent size</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">would easily hold all the bus would be able</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to carry--perhaps a full three hundred. He</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">gave orders quickly to the chauffeur, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">then the helio was hovering inches above</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the tree tops, and he tossed a plastiweave</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ladder over the side.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Don't use the radio," he snapped to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Judith. "Just get back to New-UN head-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He didn't give her a chance to argue. He</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Their action is incomprehensible to me,"</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">a civilization without it."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mason was silent for a long moment. He</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">which led from the main air lock of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Thrayxite ship to the reddish surface of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">spaceport upon which it had landed but min-</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">amazement, not because of the unexpected</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">beauty of the verdant hills that rolled in a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">delicate blend of kaleidoscopic pastels on</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">every side of the 'port and as far as the eye</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">could see, nor was it even from the sight of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the exquisite towers that rose as though from</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the heart of some fabled fairyland scant</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">miles to the south.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"They're all--all women!" Mason</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The guards spoke to-them tersely in the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">common tongue of Ihelos and Thrayx, al-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">though peculiarly accented to Ihelian ears,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and Kriijorl gestured with a slight move-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ment of his head to Mason. At a quick</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pace they started down the ramp.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We're sunk, kid," Mason said. And he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">saw the heaviness in the great Viking's face.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"We'll never make it out of here in a mil-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Their captors strapped them into ham-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">**I think for the moment their probes</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">little good. But hear me. If we are being</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">taken where 1 hope we are, then they are</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">playing into our hands almost as well as</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">we could have asked. There will be a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">limited freedom there, and a chance, if</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">we are clever enough, to get to a mentacom</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But among women?" Mason asked, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his throat was dry.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That is the p®int," Kriijorl replied</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tersely. "We shall be among males almost</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">hesitated, and Mason saw doubt in the sud-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Nuts!'' he clipped out. "That means</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">this damned thing doped out!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Ihelian began a reply, but the words</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">were stopped in his throat by die sudden</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pressure of acceleration as powerful engines</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Judith's face was white. Perhaps this was</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Chuck me," Cain said with a grin, "and</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">What information I have concerning Ihelian</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">It was all, she realized suddenly, a colossal</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">cards as he went along! And now he had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">found a wedge of some sort, some new bar-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">gaining point. There was still that curious</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">was a soft gasp from Daleb, and the com-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mander's eyes flickered, widened almost</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">imperceptibly. "And better yet, I'm a pal</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">us up just inside the Rim that time you</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">ought to be worth a fancy little pile to you,</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">on the basis of nothing more than words?</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">And the technique you describe. It has never</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Cain laughed easily. "Then maybe you</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">should make a pretty good bargaining point</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">Earth sore enough at them as it is!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The quiet in the small control bubble was</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And the Earth girls--she had heard the</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">"Still one apart from the rest of us, are</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Quickly proven, my little one! Quickly</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unfinished, and turned toward the sturdily-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The thick lips slackened into a lascivious</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much like the communications room of an</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">"What the hell else is there to do? Sit here</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and rot? They won't kill us. They'll just let</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Nature take its course--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"There's more to be done than simply</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">make a run for it to one of dieir ships-,"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Mason snapped. "The mentacoms on them,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Kriijorl's said a dozen times, haven't the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">necessary range."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"So what's your plan? Or don't I get to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hear any of the details?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mason studied the big man's face. Cap-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tured in his attempt to rescue the Earth-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">women, he had said. His explanation had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">been that simple. New-UN hadn't believed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Judith, but she had convinced him, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">so he'd tried on his own responsibility, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">simply hadn't made it. And then they'd</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">brought him here, scarcely hours after</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Mason and Kriijorl had themselves beea</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">delivered to the teaming colony.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Logical enough, yes. Cain was the kind</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">who would try such a crazy stunt, alone,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">with such supreme overconfidence in his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">own muscle power. Yet--</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We must not be impatient," Kriijorl</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">interrupted his thought. He stood up, his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">blond head nearly touching the top of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">plastifabric tent. "We must be certain and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">wait for the best time, Mister Cain. For if</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">we fail in our first attempt, there will not</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">be a second. And it has only been three</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">days. As yet, we have been left quite to our-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">selves; even my life has not been threat-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ened."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mason noticed the puzzled frown that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was 'across the Ihelian's forehead. "Do you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">think--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I cannot even guess the reason for</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that," Kriijorl murmured, as though more</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to himself than in answer to Mason's ques-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tion. "By all the rules of our conflict, I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">should be stretched naked for the jungle</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">beasts by now."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Forget it!" Cain broke in quickly.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"You're alive now, and if we can have a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">little action around here maybe you'll stay</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that way. We've watched long enough. They</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">don't guard those ships at all. These breed-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ers they keep drugged to the eyes, so why</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">should diey? I say we just grab one and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">40</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">blast off! Unless somebody's got a better</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">plan, and I still haven't heard one--"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">''Awfully anxious, aren't you, Mister</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Cain?" Mason asked.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I'm not afraid of 'em if that's what you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mean!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Lance turned to Kriijorl. "Maybe he's</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">right. We've watched for three days. What</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">do you think?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Ihelian looked out across the colony</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of low, square-shaped enclosures and to its</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">far side where the twisted jungle began;</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to the spot where the mentacom was housed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in a squat, guarded dome of crudely-shaped</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">steel. Then he turned back to die Earthman,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and Mason saw the uncertainty in his eyes.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We have gained far less than I had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hoped by watching," he said slowly. "We</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">have learned the number of their guards,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and the period of their changc, but perhaps</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that is all we shall learn. If you think that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">as soon as there is darkness--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"About time!" Cain said sourly. "And</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it'll be straight for the--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"To the mentacom first," Mason said</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">quietly. "And after that, to the ships if we</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">can, Mister Cain." He felt strangely calm</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">as his eyes met Cain's squarely. Somewhere</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">within him, there was something changing.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Take it from an ex-has-been, big man!</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">That's how it's going to be!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">THE camp was dark and silent as the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">three men left the tent. They walked as</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">if from boredom, changing direction often</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">as though at random; yet they moved with</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a deceiving swiftness, and each step brought</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">them closer to the crude dome. The sound</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of their movements was as a whisper that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">lost itself with the quiet murmur of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">night wind through the web of the jungle,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and when they were close enough, they</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">halted, to wait; to watch.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was the soft clink of metal on</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">meial and the mutter of dead-toned voices</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">as the guard changed. Four hulking shapes</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">walked at last in a tired shamble from the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">structure housing the mentacom. Four others</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">prepared to take their posts.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And there was little to disturb the silence</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">after that.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A muffled grunt, a choked off curse lost</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in a brief rustle of undergrowth as though</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a sudden breeze had momentarily ruffled its</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">languid calm. And that was all.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Four breeders lay dead outside the dome.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mason felt the warm stickiness of blood</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">on his face, and the sting of a deep cut some-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">where upon it. He saw that Cain was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">straightening over a mangled form; that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Kriijorl had overcome odds of two to one.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">The breeder at his own feet had died swiftly</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of a deftly broken neck, a reddened dirk</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">still clutched in his stiffening fingers.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then they were inside the dome, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Kriijorl was placing the head-unit of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mentacom over his matted yellow hair.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mason watched in the half-light of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pulsing orange glow, listened to the heavi-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ness of Cain's breathing.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And he saw Kriijorl's face stiffen sud-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">denly. With a swift movement the Ihelian</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had handed him the head-unit, and with</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">slipper}7 fingers he fumbled the device into</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">place over his own head.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Before he could think he had given Cain</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">all the warning that he had needed.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"My God, it's Judith! Somehow she's--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Kriijorl lunged too late. The man whom</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Judith's mentacom message had branded as</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a spy was already through the dome's door,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">running.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mason moved more quickly than the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Ihelian then. Ahead in the jungle there was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a crashing sound, and Mason tripped sud-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">denly himself as he ran, fell. Kriijorl leapt</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">past him in the darkness, as though he could</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">somehow see through it, and then Mason</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had regained his feet and was following</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">blindly.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And suddenly he thought of the empty</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ships behind them, and Cain's abrupt use-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">iessnc-ss to his Thrayxite employers. Then--</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But the gamble was too great. Cain might</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">not double back, but instead plunge head-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">long further and further into the conceal-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing morass before him. No, Cain would not</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">double back. Not now. For in Kriijorl he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had met an even match, and now he was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">afraid!</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fully an hour had passed when, his tunic</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">torn and the exposed flesh bleeding, Mason</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">caught up with Kriijorl.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"He was nearly within my hands for a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">moment--" the giant whispered feoarsely.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">He breathed with difficulty, and there were</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">long slashes gleaming redly in the darkness</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">across his great muscles.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">THE WOMAN-STEALERS OF THRAYX</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">41</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mason stood silently for moments, toy-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing with a thought that nagged insistently</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">at the edge of his brain. He knew Cain.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">He knew the man.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then suddenly his thoughts were inter-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">rupted by the muffled sound of a rocket</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">blast, and within moments there was a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">vertical trail of fire above them as a Thrayx-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ite ship hurtled skyward.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"By Jhavuul--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No!" Mason exclaimed. "The blast was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">from in front of us, he didn't double back!</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Must be another colony near our own, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he stumbled out of this overgrown mess</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and right into it. There was simply an</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">empty ship--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Then the traitor has won!" Kriijorl's</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">face was tilted upward, and in the faint</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">glow of the planetesimal belt that girdled</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Thrayx, it seemed more than ever that of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">an heroic Viking king of ages gone.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"There's a chance he hasn't!" Mason</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">breathed. He had the thought now, pinned</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">down, clear in his head. "If there has been</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">no alarm back at our own camp we may still</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">have the mentacom to ourselves. We'll</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">signal Ihelos as you planned and then--</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">then there is something else you will say.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Something else that I think will, as the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">saying goes on Earth, kill two birds with a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">single blast."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mason had lost track of time; perhaps</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it was as many as two hours before they had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fought their way through the clutching</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">undergrowth back to the mentacom at the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fringe of their own camp. Several times</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">they had had to stop, for there had been</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sounds in the jungle other than those they</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had made themselves. Animals, Kriijorl</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had said, who had got the scent of their</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">blood. But the noises had not been fast and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">crashing--more those of stealth, as were</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">those of their own steps. A single animal,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">perhaps, with the scent of their blood; or</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that of the breeder guard they had slain.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">And stalking.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The dome was still silent, and the stiff</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">corpses outside it lay undisturbed in the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">thick undergrowth. In the clearing the six</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">empty Thrayxite ships towered in the sleep-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing quiet, star-shine glinting faintly from</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">their polished hulls.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Wordlessly, they entered the dome, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it was as they had left it.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Kriijorl again adjusted the headset, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the orange glow pulsed and waned as</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Mason watched.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And then at length, "If they are to know,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">they know now," Kriijorl said. "And the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Thrayxite host as well. What was there you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">wished to add, Lieutenant?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mason spoke quickly. "Say that you have</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">discovered that the priceless--and you must</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">say priceless--Book of the Saints is in the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Forest of Saarl on Thrayx. Say that we have</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">discovered it to be less well protected than</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">is generally believed. Then give the loca-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tion of the subterranean vault as precisely</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">as you can!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But my people are well aware--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I realize that, but our friend Cain</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">doesn't!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Ihelian's face was still puzzled, but</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he projected the thought-message Mason</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had dictated.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And then in seconds the Ihelian had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hastily but thoroughly wrecked the mcn-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tacom, and the two men left its silent dome</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">for the empty ships that beckoned so tan-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">talizingly a scant quarter-mile distant.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They had run perhaps a dozen steps</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">when the undergrowth behind them ripped</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and tore, and Mason spun.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was a muffled cry, and he had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">barely time to catch Judith's bleeding body</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">as she fell in exhaustion into his arms.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">VI</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">THE muscles in his arms and legs trem-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">bled with fatigue as he lifted the semi-</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">with what seemed an impossible effort,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hauled himself through the deserted ship's</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stern airlock.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Ihelian seemed to carry Judith as</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was only the sound of his own</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">''W/i/ don't you find yourself seme</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nice little American girl," his father</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had often repeated. But George was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">on Venus . . . and he loved pale</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">green skin . . . and globular heads</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and most of all, George</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">loved Gistla.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">EGRGE KENINGTON was sixteen,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and, as he told himself, someone</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">who was sixteen knew more about</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">love than someone who was, say, forty-two.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Like his father, for instance. A whole lot</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">more probably. When you were forty-two,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">you got narrow-minded and nervous and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">angry. You said this is this, and that is that,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and there is nothing else. When someone</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">thought and felt and talked that way,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">George thought bitterly, there was not</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">enough room inside that person to know</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">what it was like, loving a Venusian.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">But George knew. He knew very well.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Her name was Gistla. She was not pretty</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in standards of American colonists. She had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the pale greenish Venusian skin, and she</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was too short and rather thick. Her face, of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">course, was not an American face. It was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the face of native Venus. Round and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">smooth, with the large lidless eyes. There</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">were no visible ears and a lack of hair</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">strengthened the globular look of her head.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">But she was a person. The beauty was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">inside of her. Did you have to point to a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">girl's face and say, "Here is v/here the nose</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">should be, here is where the ears should</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">be?" Did you have to measure the width be-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fcween eyes and test the color of the skin?</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">45</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Did you have to check the size of the teeth</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and the existence of hair? Was all of this</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">necessary to understand what was inside</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">someone?</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">George snapped a leaf from an overhang-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing vine and threw it angrily to the ground.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">He was walking along a thin path that led</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">from the colony to the tangled hills beyond,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">where hues of red and yellow and purple</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">reflected like bold sweeps of watercolor. In</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a moment he would see Gistla, and with the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">color before his eyes and the sweet perfume</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of the flowers in his lungs, he felt again the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">familiar rise of excitement.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">George had not always lived on Venus.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">The Colony was very new. By 2022, most</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of the Earth countries had sent colonizers to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Mars. But as yet, in June of that year, Venus</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had been touched by only the sparsest in-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">vasion of American civilization. George had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">arrived-just three years ago, when his father</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had been appointed Secretary of the coloniz-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing unit.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And tliat was the whole trouble, really.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Father was the Secretary, Mother was the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Secretary's wife, Sister was the daughter of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the Secretary. Everybody was wrapped up</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in it. Except George.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">George loved Gistla.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why don't you find yourself some nice</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">little American girl?" his father had said.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Say like Henry Parrel's little daughter?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Henry Farrel's little daughter was a sweet</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sickening girl with a nasty temper and a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nasty tongue. Her father was Governor of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the Colony. She told you about it all the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">time.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Or," his father had told him, "why not</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">little what's-her-name, Doug Brentwood's</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">daughter?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Little what's-her-name's father was the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">President of the Council. "My father is</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">President of the Council/' she said. Over</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and over, as though in a settlement the size</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of the Colony, there would be anyone who</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">wouldn't know her father was the Presi-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dent of the Council.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was all a very tight and careful circle,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">chosen on Earth with a great deal of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">''common sense."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There were the ordinary settlers, of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">course. They had daughters. Some of them</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">were very pretty and long-limbed. And</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">George had thought about that.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Certainly there wasn't a decent looking</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">girl in the whole Governing circle, and the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sight of a girl with flashing eyes and a nice</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">red mouth, who was shaped a little like</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">something besides a tree stump, was indeed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">an exciting sight.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But there were limitations to the settler</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">girls.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They had no background to speak of, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">though that didn't make any difference,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">George assured himself, they knew nothing</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">about art, music, poetry, or anything really</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">worth while. And, too, while George's</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">father had said, "Now George, we're all</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">one here. Each of us is as good as another.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Joe Finch, who cares for the flowers out-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">side, is every bit as good a man as I am"--</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">still George knew, if he told his parents</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he was going to marry Joe Finch's daughter</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">someday, there would be hell to pay.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">So as long as the restrictions had been</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">bound around him, there was no reason</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to go just half-way. George was not an</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ordinary boy. He did things in extreme.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">He was now in love with a Venusian girl,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and his family was already starting to make</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him pay.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">GEORGE turned off the path, just beyond</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">an arch of thick purple-green vines</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that always reminded him of a gate to a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">garden. There was a quiet simplicity to this</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">small clearing where he and Gistla met.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">There was an aloneness to it, and only the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sound of the flat shiny leaves sliding to-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">gether and the high, trilling sound of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">small Venusian birds broke the peaceful</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">silence. They had always met here, nowhere</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">else.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Now, as George found himself in the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">clearing, he began to wonder what Gistla</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">would say or do when he told her he was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">taking her home to meet his family. It had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">been a sudden decision, brought out of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">anger and indignation.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">George sat down upon the fiat hollow' of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a large vine. The sky was murky as usual,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">but the soft warm feel and smell of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">growth around him, with its color and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">brightness, made up for a sunless sky.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As he waited, he remembered what his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mother had said:</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Oh, George, you're really not serious</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">about bringing a Venusian into our home!"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">GEORGE LOVES G1STLA</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">aister, „,y</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">God!" Mari, who was eighteen, said this</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to most anything.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But his father, eyes bright and alert, had</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said, "No, now if George wants to bring</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one of these, ah, Venusians home with him,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that's his privilege. I think it would be very</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">interesting."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">George knew what his father meant by</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">interesting.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Exposing Gistla to his family would result</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in deliberate sarcasm and-eye-squinting and</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">barely hidden smiles. There would be</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pointed remarks and direct insults. And</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when it was over, George knew, he would</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be expected to see the error of his ways.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He would then be expected to forget about</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this odd creature and find himself a nice</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ignorant little Colony girl, whose father</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was a member of the Governing circle.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">And to hell with that, too, George said.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What?'' George heard Gistla say. He</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">turned quickly. She was standing at the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">edge of the clearing, her round green eyes</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">looking soft and serious. She w'ore the usual</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">gray cape that reached her ankles. Her</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">voice was a deep round sound, and there</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was hardly any accent in the words she</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had learned so quickly since the Colony-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had begun.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Talking to myself," George grinned.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">The old excitement w'as inside of him.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">There was a kind of exotic quality in meet-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing Gistla that never disappeared.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She crossed the clearing, not too grace-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fully, and touched her fingers against his</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hand. This had been the extent of their</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">physical expression of love.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It is nice to see you, George."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He noticed his feeling of pleasure w'hen</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he heard her speak his name. There was</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">something about his ow'n name being spoken</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by Gistla that had always seemed even more</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strange than anything else.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She sat down beside him, and they looked</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at each other w'hile the leaves w'hispered</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">around them and the birds fluttered and</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chirped. He discovered again the feeling of</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rightness, sitting beside Gistla. There was a</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">solidity about her, a quiet maturity that he</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seemed able to feel in himself only when</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he was with her. And that too was strange,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">because in American terms of age, she was</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much younger than he.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Sitting, as they were doing, silent, watch-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing each other, had been most of their</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">activity. You did not need to entertain</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Gistla with foolish small-talk or exaggerated</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">praising.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But right now he w-antcd to tell her</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">quickly, to make sure that she w^ouid fed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the^ enthusiasm he had felt.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Listen, Gistla," lie said, while she</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">watched him with her soft-looking round</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eyes. "I want you to come with me today</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to meet my family."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">His words seemed to have an odd ring</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to them, and George waited tensely until</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he was sure that she was not shocked or</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">angry about what he had just said.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">^ She sat silently for a moment and then</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she said, "Do you diink that is right for</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me to do, George?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Sure it is! Why not? They know about</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you and me. They know w'e're in love."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Love--' jShe spoke the word as though</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it were an indefinite, elusive thing that you</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could not offer as reason for doing any-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Gistla was very wise, George realized,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but this was a time for endiusiasm, a rime</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to strengthen their own relationship in this</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">world.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Say you will!" George said.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Do you want me to?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Well, sure I do. What did you think?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She held her hands in her lap quietly.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They were not unlike his ow'n, George</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">observed, except for the extreme smallness</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the color.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I do not diink it will be nice for rm</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or diem," she said.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Ah, listen, Gistla. Don't talk that way.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">li'il be fine!" But he knew that he was</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not deceiving her with die lightness he tried</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to put into his voice.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then, although she had never done it</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">before, she reached out and touched his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">check. George had grow-n used to the emo-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tions that reflected on her face, and he knew</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">she was suddenly very sad. "Yes, George,"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">she said. *'I will go with you to meet your</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">famjly." And she said it as though she were</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">telling him good-by.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">IT WAS no better than he had expected.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was worse. Much worse. And he was</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">growing angrier by die moment. They were</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">43</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all seated in the rock-walled patio behind</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the large white house. Gistla sat beside him,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">looking very small and frightened and very</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">different. And it was that obvious difference</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that George had hoped everyone might</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ignore. But instead, each of them, his father,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his mother, his sister, appeared to be trying</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to make it even more obvious.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The first strain, when everyone had sat</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">there staring at Gistla as though she were</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">something behind a cage, had passed. But</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">now his parents and sister were moving in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a new direction. They had relaxed, having</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">found control of the situation, and they</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">were cutting her to pieces.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'Tell me," his sister was saying, her eyes</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dancing slyly, "don't you people have some</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">very strange tricks you can do?'</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">George tightened his fingers against his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">palms. He heard Gistla answer, ' Tricks?"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Yes." His, sister's white smile shined.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"You know, like making things disappear,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">things like that."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"My'father," Gistla said seriously, "can</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">do very wonderful things. He is a musi-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cian."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">George's father leaned forward, blinking</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">amusedly. "Really? What does he play?"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Play?" asked Gistla.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes. He's a musician. He must play</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">something, some kind of instrument."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Gistla looked at George, but George did</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">not know what to say. He wished he had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">never tried to do this. He wished he had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">just ignored his family and gone on loving</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Gistla in the privacy of his own emotions.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well, now," Mr. Kenington was saying</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">rather impatiently. "Does he play something</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">like our violin or clarinet or oboe, or what?"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">His father, George had noticed, was becom-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing impatient more frequently since he had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">become Secretary. The Secretarial post was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">very important.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"He does not play anything," Gistla said</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">carefully. "He just . . . makes the music</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and I hear it."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But how?" Mr. Kenington insisted.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">" What does he play the music on? He cer-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tainly can't make the music without using</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">something to make it on."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Gistla glanced again at George and he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">said quickly, "Il's pretty hard to understand,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Father. I don't think--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No, now don't interrupt just now, soo.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">This is very interesting. We'd like to know</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">what she's talking about."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Kenington spoke for the first time.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Are you just making this up?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was like a whip coming through the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">air. His mother sat there, blinking, the sus-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">picion and distrust she felt-for this creature</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">showing in her eyes and upon her mouth</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and'even in the way she was sitting.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Now, Lois," Mr. Kenington said, as</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">though he really sympathized with what</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">she had said, believing that not only Gistla</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was making it up, but that all of her race</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">made everything up. But he was stubborn.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Come now, tell us. Tell us what you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mean."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Gistla's smooth head turned this way and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that. "Sometimes," she said slowly, "my</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">father journeys to other places, and if he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cannot return soon, he sends me music.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">When the light has gone from the day and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">I am alone, I hear it."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You mean he sends it by wires or by</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">radio?" Mr. Kenington asked with surprise.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Now, wait a minute," George's sister</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">leaned forward, smiling. "You just hear</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">this music, is that right? Up here." She</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tapped her forehead.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," said Gistla.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"My God," George's sister said. She</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">looked at her parents, arching her eyebrows.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You shouldn't make things up,"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">George's mother said.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Mother," George said, his face coloring.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"She's not making things up!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Just a moment, son," Mr. Kenington</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">said crisply. "You don't want to talk to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">your mother in that tone."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No, but my God," George's sister went</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">on. "Imagine. No wires, no loudspeakers,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">just ... up here." She tapped her forehead</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">again.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I'm not talking to my mother in any</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tone at all," George said, disregarding his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sister.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well, she shouldn't lie," said Mrs.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Kenington with conviction.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">George stood up. "She is not lying,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Mother."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I forbid you to argue with your mother</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that way, George," said Mr. Kenington.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I mean, my God," said George's sister</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">happily. "This is an innovation! Can you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">GEORGE LOVES GISTLA</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">49</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">imagine? Gistla, or whatever your name is,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">could your father make his music sometime</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">when we have a dance?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Gistla's eyes were hurt and she was,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">George knew, confused. She shook her head.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Kenington was blinking accusingly.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Do they teach you to make these things</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">up? Is that what they teach you at home?"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Mother, will you please?" George said.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Why must you talk to her that way?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Kenington stood up quickly. "I did</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">not raise my son to show an attitude like</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that to his mother."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But she isn't making this up," George</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">said. "You asked her to tell you and she--"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">George's sister had jumped out of her</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">chair and she was waltzing over the patio.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">She began humming as she danced. "Can't</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">you just see it? Everyone dancing around,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">listening to music in their heads? No or-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">chestra or records or anything?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Kenington stood very tall. "Are you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">taking the word of your mother, or this . . .</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">this ..." He motioned curtly at Gistla.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">George licked his lips, looking defensive-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ly at each one of his family. "It isn't a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">matter of taking anyone's word at all. It's</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">just something we don't understand."</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">George's sister whirled and then suddenly</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">she stopped, putting her hand against her</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mouth. "My God, what if everyone got the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">music different? I mean, does everyone hear</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the same music, dear? Because if they didn't,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">what a mess!" She began dancing again, her</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">skirt swirling over the bricks of the patio.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Kenington's voice was louder. "I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">think we understand, all right, George.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">There isn't anything about this we don't</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">understand!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">George's lips were paling.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">His sister dipped and turned. "We could</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">call it a Music In The Head dance. Every-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">body brings his own head!" She laughed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">merrily. "My God!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">George noticed then that Gistla was dis-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">appearing out of the rear gate. He stood,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">clenching his fists and glaring at his family.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">His sister had stopped dancing but she</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was still laughing.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I didn't think, George," his mother</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">said resolutely, "that you were going to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">invite someone who lied."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">George turned and ran after Gistla.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">A--Planet--January</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">THEY sat again in the clearing. George</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">could still feel the anger churning in-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">side him, and he held his hands together</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">so tightly that his fingers began to ache.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"I hate them for that," he said.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Gistla touched his arm. "No, George. It</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">is all right. It is the way things are."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'But they don't need to be! My family</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">did that on purpose."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"They just don't understand. My race is</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">very different from yours and it seems</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">strange."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"So does mine," George said, standing</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and beginning to pace back and forth.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It had been what he really had expected.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">But still he had hoped, somehow, that his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">family might have understood. He looked</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">at Gistla, sitting quietly, her large eyes</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">watching him. He knew he loved her very</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">much just then, more in fact than he ever</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had before, because she had been refused</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">by his family.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Listen, Gistla," he said, kneeling on the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">grass in front of her. "It won't make any</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">difference what anyone thinks or does or</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">says. I love you, and I'll go on loving you.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">We'll build our own life the way we want</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She shook her head slowly. "No, George.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">It does make a difference. You cannot forget</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">your family or your people. That is impor-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Do you love me?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Then that's all that's important to me.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Not what anyone thinks. Not what my</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sister thinks or my father ©r my mother."</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"We are different, you and I." She sat</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">unmoving, her smooth .face unchanging.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"My people seem strange t© yours because</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">we can do things your people do not under-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stand. We seem strange because we look</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">things differently."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"My values are the same as yours,"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">George pleaded. "I love you because of</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"George," she said. "Look at me."</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">George met her eyes suddenly, caught by</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the urgency in her voice. And slowly, in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">front of his eyes, she changed. Her features</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">shifted, until George saw a beautiful young</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">50</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">girl with pink white skin and red lips. He</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">saw shining blue eyes and shimmering</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">golden hair that fell over her shoulders.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Gistla's body had changed to a lithe, smooth</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">figure that revealed its contours beneath the</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gray cape.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He caught his breath and wiped a hand</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at his eyes.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What you see," said Gistla softly, "is</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an illusion. You see what would be in your</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">George opened his mouth but was un-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">George reached out and touched his fin-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">' You're beautiful."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," she said sadly.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But--you really are! Your hair and your</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She shook her head to show its unimpor-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">George raised himself from his knees</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">Since we're going to be together for awhile</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">we might as well get to know each other."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The man studied him. Slowly his hand</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">came out. "Why not? My name's Erickson.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Ralf Erickson."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Erickson?" Thacher smiled. "You look</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">like a commercial man, to me." He nodded</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">toward the sample case on the floor. "Am I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">right?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The man named Erickson started to an-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">swer, but at that moment there was a stir.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">A thin man of about thirty had come up to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the table, his eyes bright, staring down at</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">them warmly. "Well, we're on our way,"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he said to Erickson.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Hello, Mara." He pulled out a chair and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sat down quickly, folding his hands on the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">table before him. He noticed Thacher and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">drew back a little. "Pardon me," he mur-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mured.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Bob Thacher is my name," Thacher said.</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"T hope I'm not intruding here." He</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">glanced around at the three of them, Mara,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">alert, watching him intently, heavy-set</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Erickson, his face blank, and this person.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Say, do you three know each other?" he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">asked suddenly.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was silence.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The robot attendant slid over soundlessly,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">poised to take their orders. Erickson roused</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">himself. "Let's see," he murmured. "What</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will we have? Mara?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Whiskey and water."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You, Jan?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The bright slim man smiled. "The same."</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Gin and tonic."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Whiskey and water for me, also," Erick-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">son said, The robot attendant went off. It</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">returned at once with the drinks, setting on</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the table. Each took his own. "Well,"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Erickson said, holding his glass up. "To</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">our mutual success."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ALL drank, Thacher and the three of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">them, heavy set Erickson, Mara, her</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">eyes nervous and alert, Jan, who had just</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">come. Again a look passed between Mara</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and Erickson a look so swift that he would</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">not have caught it had he not been looking</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">directly at her.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What line do you represent, Mr. Erick-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">son?" Thacher asked.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Erickson glanced at him, then down at</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the sample case on the floor. He grunted.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Well, as you can see, I'm a salesman."</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Thacher smiled. "I knew it! You get so</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">you can always spot a salesman right off by</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his sample case. A salesman always has to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">carry something to show. What are you in,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sir?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Erickson paused. He licked his thick lips,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his eyes blank and lidded, like a toad's.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">At last he rubbed his mouth with his hand</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and reached down, lifting up the sample</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cas,f' He it: on tlie tak*e in front of him.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well?'' he said. "Perhaps we might even</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">show Mr. Thacher."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They all stared down at the sample case.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It seemed to be an ordinary leather case,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a metal handle and a snap lock. "I'm</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">getting curious," Thacher said. "What's in</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there? You're all so tense. Diamonds?</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Stolen jewels?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jan laughed harshly, mirthlessly. "£rick,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">put it down. We're not far enough away,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">yet;.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Nonsense," Erick rumbled. "We're</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">away, Jan."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Please," Mara whispered. "Wait, Erick."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Wait? Why? What for? You're so ac-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">customed to--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Erick, ' Mara said. She nodded toward</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Thacher. "We don't know him, Erick.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Please!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"He's a Terran, isn't he?" Erickson said.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"All Terrans are together in these times."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He fumbled suddenly at the catch lock on</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">die case. "Yes, Mr. Thacher. I'm a salesman.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We're all salesmen, the three of us."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">' Then you do know each other."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes." Erickson nodded. His two com-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">panions sal rigidly, staring down. "Yes, we</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">do. Here, I'll show you our line."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He opened the case. From it he took a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">letier-knife, a pencil sharpener, a glass globe</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">paper weight, a box of thumb tacks, a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stapler, some clips, a plastic ashtray, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">some things Thacher could not identify.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">He placed the objects in a row in front of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him on the table top. Then he closed the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sample case.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I gather you're in office supplies,"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Thacher said. He touched the letter knife</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">with his finger. "Nice quality steel. Looks</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">like Swedish steel, to me."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Erickson nodded, looking into Thacher's</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">face. "Not really an impressive business,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is it? Office supplies. Ashtrays, paper dips."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He smiled.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">i "Oh--" Thacher shrugged. "Why not?</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">They're a necessity in modern business. The</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">only thing I wonder--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What's that?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well, I wonder how you'd ever find</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">enough customers on Murs to make it worth</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">your while. ' He paused, examining the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">glass paper weight. He lifted it up, holding</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it to the light, staring at the scene within</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">until Erickson took it out of his hand and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">put it back in the sample case. "And an-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">other tiling. If you three know each other,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">why did you sit apart when you got on?"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">They looked at him quickly.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And why didn't you speak to each other</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">until we left Deimos?" He leaned toward</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Erickson, smiling at him. "Two men and a</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">woman. Three of you. Sitting apart in the</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ship. Not speaking, not until the check*</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">THE CRYSTAL CRYPT</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">station was past. I find myself thinking over</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what the Martian said. Three saboteurs. A</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">woman and two men."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Erickson put the things back in the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sample case. He was smiling, but his face</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had gone chalk white. Mara stared down,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">playing with a drop of water on the edge</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of her glass. Jan clenched his hands to-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">gether nervously, blinking rapidly.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You three are the ones the Leiter was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">after," Thacher said softly. ''You are the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">destroyers, the saboteurs. But their lie de-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tector-- Why didn't it trap you? How did</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">you get by that? And now you're safe, out-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">side the check-station." He grinned, staring</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">around at them. "I'll be damned! And I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">really thought you were a salesman, Erick-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">son. You really fooled me."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Erickson relaxed a little. "Well, Mr.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Thacher, it's in a good cause. I'm sure you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">have no love for Mars, either. No Ter ran</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">does. And I see you're leaving with the rest</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of us."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"True," Thacher said. "You must cer-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tainly have an interesting account to give,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the three of you." He looked around the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">table.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We still have an hour or so of travel.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Sometimes it gets dull, this Mars-Terra run.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Nothing to see, nothing to do but sit and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">drink in the lounge." He raised his eyes</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">slowly. "Any chance you'd like to spin a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">story to keep us awake?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jan and Mara looked at Erickson. "Go</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">on," Jan said. "He knows who we are. Tell</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him the rest of the story."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You might as well," Mara said.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jan let out a sigh suddenly, a sigh of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">relief. "Let's put the cards on the table, get</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tliis weight off us. I'm tired of sneaking</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">around, slipping--**</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Sure," Erickson said expansively. "Why</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">not?" He settled back in his cair, unbutton-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing his vest. "Certainly, Mr. Thacher. I'll</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">be glad bo spin you a story. And I'm sure</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it will be interesting enough to keep you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">awake."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">THEY laa through the groves of dead</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">trees, leaping across the sun-baked</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Martian soil, running silently together. They</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">went up a little rise, across a narrow ridge.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Suddenly Erick stopped, throwing himself</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">down flat on the ground. The others did</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the same, pressing themselves against the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">soil, gasping for breath.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Be silent," Erick muttered. He raised</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">himself a little. "No noise. There'll be</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Leiters nearby, from now on. We don't dare</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">take any chances."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Between the three people lying in the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">grove of dead trees and the City was a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">barren, level waste of desert, over a mile of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">blasted sand. No trees or bushes marred</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the smooth, parched surface. Only an occa-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sional wind, a dry wind eddying and twist-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing, blew the sand up into little rills. A</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">faint odor came to them, a bitter smell of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">heat and sand, carried by the wind.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Erick pointed. "Look. The City-- There</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it is."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They stared, still breathing deeply from</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">their race through the trees. The City was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">close, closer than they had ever seen it</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">before. Never had they gotten so close to it</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in times past. Terrans were never allowed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">near the great Martian cities, the centers of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Martian life. Even in ordinary times, when</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">there was no threat of approaching war, the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Martians shrewdly kept all Terrans away</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">from their citadels, partly from fear, partly</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">from a deep, innate sense of hostility toward</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the white-skinned visitors whose commer-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cial ventures had earned them the respect,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and the dislike, of the whole system.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How does it look to you?" Erick said.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The City was huge, much larger than</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">they had imagined from the drawings and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">models they had studied so carefully back</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in New York, in the War Ministry Office.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Huge it was, huge and stark, black towers</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">rising up against the sky, incredibly thin</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">columns of ancient metal, columns that had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stood wind and sun for centuries. Around</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the City was a wall of stone, red stone,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">immense bricks that had been lugged there</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and fitted into place by slaves of the early</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Martian dynasties, under the whiplash of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the first great Kings of Mars.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">An ancient, sun-baked City, a City set in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the middle of a wasted plain, beyond groves</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of dead trees, a City seldom seen by Terrans</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">--but a City studied on maps and charts in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">every War Office on Terra. A City that con-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tained, for all its ancient stone and archaic</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">towers, the ruling group of all Mars, the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Council of Senior Leiters, black-clad men</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">who governed and ruled with an iron hand.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Senior Leiters, twelve fanatic and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">devoted men, black priests, but priests with</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">flashing rods of fire, lie detectors, rocket</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ships, intra-space cannon, many more things</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the Terran Senate could only conjecture</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">about. The Senior Leiters and their subor-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dinate Province Leiters--Erick and the two</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">behind him suppressed a shudder.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We've got to be careful," Erick said</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">again. "We'll be passing among them, soon,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">if they guess who we are, or what we're</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">here for--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He snapped open the case lie carried,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">glancing inside for a second. Then he closed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it again, grasping the handle firmly. "Let's</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">go," he said. He stood up slowly. "You two</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">come up beside me. I want to make sure</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">you look the way you should."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">MARA and Jan stepped quickly ahead.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Erick studied them critically as the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">three of them walked slowly down the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">slope, onto the plain, toward the towering</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">black spires of the City.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Jan," Erick said. "Take hold of her</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hand! Remember, you're going to marry</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">her; she's your bride. And Martian peasants</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">think a lot of their brides.''</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jan was dressed in the short trousers and</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">tied around his waist, a hat on his head to</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">by dye until it was almost bronze.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You look fine," Erick said to him. He</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">glanced at Mara. Her black hair was tied</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in a knot, looped through a hollowed-out</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">yuke bone. Her face was dark, too, dark</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and lined with colored ceremonial pigment,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">green and orange stripes across her cheeks.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Earrings w'ere strung through her ears. On</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">her feet were tiny slippers of perruh hide,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">laced around her ankles, and she wore long</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">translucent Martian trousers with a bright</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sash tied around her waist. Between her</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">small breasts a chain of stone beads rested,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">good-Iuck charms for the coming marriage.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"All right," Erick said. He, himself, wore</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the flowing grey robe of a Martian priest,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dirty robes that were supposed to remain on</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him all his life, to be buried around him</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">when he died. "I think we'll get past the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">guards. There should be heavy morning</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">traffic on the road."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They walked on, the hard sand crunching</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">under their feet. Against the horizon they</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">could see specks moving, other persons</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">going toward the City, farmers and peasants</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and merchants, bring their crops and goods</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to market.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"See the cart!" Mara exclaimed.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They were nearing a narrow road, two</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ruts worn into the sand. A Martian hufa</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was pulling the cart, its great sides wet with</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">perspiration, its tongue hanging out. The</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cart was piled high with bales of cloth,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">rough country cloth, hand dipped. A bent</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">farmer urged the hufa on.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And there." She pointed, smiling.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A group of merchants riding small ani-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mals were moving along behind the cart,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Marxians in long robes, their faces hidden</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">by sand masks. On each animal was a pack,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">carefully tied on with rope. And beyond the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">merchants, plodding dully along, were</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">peasants and farmers in an endless proces-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sion, some riding carts or animals, but</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mostly on foot.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mara and Jan and Erick joined the line</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of people, melting in behind the merchants.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">No one noticed them; no one looked up or</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">gave any sign. The march continued as be-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fore. Neither Jan nor Mara said anything to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">each other. They walked a little behind</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Erick, who paced with a certain dignity, a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">certain bearing becoming his position.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Once he slowed down, pointing up at</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the sky. "Look," he murmured, in the Mar-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tian hill dialect. "See that?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Two black dots circled lazily. Martian</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">patrol craft, the military on the outlook for</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">any sign of unusual activity. War was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">almost ready to break out with Terra. Any</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">day, almost any moment.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We'll be just in time," Erick said.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Tomorrow will be too late. The last ship</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">will have left Mars."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I hope nothing stops us," Mara said.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"I want to get back home when we're</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">through."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">HALF an hour passed. They neared the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">City, the wall grewing as they walked,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">rising higher and higher until it seemed to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">blot out the sky itself. A vast wall," a wall</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of eternal stone that had felt the wind and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sun for centuries. A group of Martian</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">soldiers were standing at the entrance, the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">single passage-gate hewn into the rock,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">THE CRYSTAL CRYPT</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">61</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">leading to the City. As each person went</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">through the soldiers examined him, poking</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his garments, looking into his load.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Erick tensed. The line had slowed almost</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to a halt. "It'll be our turn, soon," he mur-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mured. "Be prepared."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Let's hope no Leiters come around,"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Jan said. "The soldiers aren't so bad."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mara was staring up at the wall and the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">towers beyond.'Under their feet the ground</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">trembled, vibrating and shaking. She could</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">see tongues of flame rising from the towers,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">from the deep underground factories and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">forges of the City. The air was thick and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dense with particles of soot. Mara rubbed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">her mouth, coughing.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Here they come," Erick said softly.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The merchants had been examined and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">allowed to pass through the dark gate, the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">entrance through the wall into the City.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">They and their silent animals had already</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">disappeared inside. The leader of the group</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of soldiers was beckoning impatiently to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Erick, waving him on.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Come along!" he said. "Hurry up there,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">old man."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Erick advanced slowly, his arms wrapped</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">around his body, looking down at the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Who are you and what's your business</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">here?" the soldier demanded, his hands on</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his hips, his gun hanging idly at his waist.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Most of the soldiers were lounging lazily,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">leaning against the wall, some even squat-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ting in the shade. Flies crawled on the face</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of one who had fallen asleep, his gun on</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the ground beside him.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"My business?" Erick murmured. "I am</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a village priest."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why do you want to enter the City?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I must bring these two people before</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the magistrate to marry them." He indicated</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Mara and Jan, standing a little behind him.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"That is the Law the Leiters have made.''</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">The soldier laughed. He circled around</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Erick. "What do you have in that bag you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">carry?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Laundry. We stay the night."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What village are you from?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Kranos."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Kranos?" The soldier looked to a com-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">panion, "Ever heard of Kranos?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"A backward pig sty. I saw it</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">boating trip."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">once on ft</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The leader of the soldiers nodded to Jan</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and Mara. The two of them advanced, their</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hands clasped, standing close together. One</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of the soldiers put his hand on Mara's bare</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">shoulder, turning her around.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Nice little wife you're getting," he said.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Good and firm looking." He winked,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">grinning lewdly.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jan glanced at him in sullen resentment.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">The soldiers guffawed. "All right," the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">leader said to Erick. "You people can pass."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Erick took a small purse from his robes</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and gave the soldier a coin. Then the three</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of them went into the dark tunnel that was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the entrance, passing through the wall of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stone, into the City beyond.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They were within the City!</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Now," Erick whispered. "Hurry."</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Around them the City roared and cracked,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the sound of a thousand vents and machines,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">shaking the stones under their feet. Erick</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">led Mara and Jan into a corner, by a row</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of brick warehouses. People were every-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">where, hurrying back and forth, shouting</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">above the din, merchants, peddlers, soldiers,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">street women. Erick bent down and opened</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the case he carried. From the case he quickly</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">took three small coils of fine metal, intricate</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">meshed wires and vanes worked together</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">into a small cone. Jan took one and Mara</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">took one. Erick put the remaining cone into</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his robe and snapped the case shut again,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Now remember, the coils must be buried</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in such a way that the line runs through the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">center of the City. We must trisect the main</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">section, where the largest concentration of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">buildings is. Remember the maps! Watch</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the alleys and streets carefully. Talk to no</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">one if you can help it. Each of you has</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">enough Martian money to buy your way out</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of trouble. Watch especially for cut-purses,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and for heaven's sake, don t get lost."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ERICK broke off. Two black-clad Leiters</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">were coming along the inside of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">wall, strolling together with their hands</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">behind their backs. They noticed the three</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">who stood in the corner by the warehouses</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and stopped.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Go," Erick muttered. "And be back here</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">at sundown." He smiled grimly. "Or never</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">come back."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Each went off a different way, walking</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">quickly without looking back. The Leiters</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">62</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">watched them go. "The little bride was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">quite lovely/' one I.eiter said. "Those hill</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">people have the stamp of nobility in their</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">blood, from the old times."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"A very lucky young peasant to possess</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">her/' the other said. They went on. Erick</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">looked after them, still smiling a little. Then</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he joined the surging mass of people that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">milled eternally through the streets of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">City.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">At dusk they met outside the gate. The</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sun was soon to set, and the air had turned</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">thin and frigid. It cut through their cloth-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing like knives.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mara huddled against Jan, trembling and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">rubbing her bare arms.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well?" Erick said. "Did you both suc-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ceed?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Around them peasants and merchants</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">were pouring from the entrance, leaving the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">City to return to their farms and villages,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">starting the long trip back across the plain</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">toward the hills beyond. None of them</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">noticed the shivering girl and the young</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">man and the old priest standing by the wall.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Mine's in place," Jan said. "On the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">other side of the City, on the extreme edge.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Buried by a well."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Mine's in the industrial section," Mara</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">whispered, her teeth chattering. "Jan, give</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">me something to put over me! I'm</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">freezing."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">' Good," Erick said. "Then the three coils</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">should trisect dead center, if the models</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">v/ere correct." He looked up at the darken-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing sky. Already, stars were beginning to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">show. Two dots, the evening patrol, moved</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">slowly toward the horizon. "Let's hurry. It</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">won't be long."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">1'hey joined the line of Martians moving</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">along the road, away from the City. Behind</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">them the City was losing itself in the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sombre tones of night, its black spires dis-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">appearing into darkness.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They walked silently with the country</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">people until the flat ridge of dead trees</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">became visible on the horizon. Then they</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">left the road and turned off, walking</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">toward the trees.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Almost time!" Erick said. He increased</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his pace, looking back at Jan and Mara</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">impatiently.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Come on!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They hurried, making their way through</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the twilight, stumbling over rocks and dead</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">branches, up the side of the ridge. At the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">top Erick halted, standing with his hands oil</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his hips, looking back.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"See," he murmured. "The City. The last</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">time well ever see it this way."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Can I sit down?" Mara said. "My feet</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hurt me."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jan pulled at Erick's sleeve. "Hurry,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Erick! Not much time left." He laughed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nervously. "If everything goes right we'll be</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">able to look at it--forever."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But not like this," Erick murmured. He</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">squatted down, snapping his case open. He</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">took some tubes and wiring out and as-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sembled them together on the ground, at</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the peak of the ridge. A small pyramid of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">wire and plastic grew, shaped by his expert</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hands.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">At last he grunted, standing up. "All</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">right."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Is it pointed directly at the City?" Mara</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">asked anxiously, looking down at the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pyramid.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Erick nodded. "Yes, it's placed accord-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing--" He stopped, suddenly stiffening.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Get back! It's time! Hurry!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jan ran, down the far side of the slope,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">away from the City, pulling Mara with him.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Erick came quickly after, still looking back</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">at the distant spires, almost lost in the night</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sky.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Down."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jan sprawled out, Mara beside him, her</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">trembling body pressed against his. Erick</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">settled down into the sand and dead</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">branches, still trying to see. "I want to see</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it," he murmured. "A miracle. I want to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">see--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A flash, a blinding burst of violet light,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">lit up the sky. Erick clapped his hands over</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his eyes. The flash whitened, growing</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">larger, expanding. Suddenly there was a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">roar, and a furious hot wind rushed past</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him, throwing him on his face in the sand.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">The hot dry wind licked and seared at</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">them, crackling the bits of branches into</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">flame. Mara and Jan shut their eyes, pressed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tightly together.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"God--" Erick muttered.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The storm passed. They opened their</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">eyes slowly. The sky was still alive with</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fire, a drifting cloud of sparks that was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">beginning to dissipate with the night wind.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">THE CRYSTAL CRYPT</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Erick stood up unsteadily, helping Jan and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Mara to their feet. The three of them stood,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">staring silently across the, dark waste, the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">black plain, none of them speaking.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The City was gone.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">At last Erick turned away. "That part's</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">done," he said. "Now the rest! Give me a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hand, Jan. There'll be a thousand patrol</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ships around here in a minute."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I see one already," Mara said, pointing</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">up. A spot winked in the sky, a rapidly</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">moving spot. "They're coming, Erick."</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">There was a throb of chill fear in her voice,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I know." Erick and Jan squatted on the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ground around the pyramid of tubes and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">plastic, pulling the pyramid apart. Hie</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pyramid was fused, fused together like</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">molten glass. Erick tore the pieces away</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">with trembling fingers. From the remains</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of the pyramid he pulled something forth,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">something he held up high, trying to make</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it out in the darkness. Jan and Mara came</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">close to see, both staring up intently, almost</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">without breathing.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"There it is," Erick said. "There!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">IN HIS hand was a globe, a small trans-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">parent globe of glass. Within the glass</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">something moved, something minute and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fragile, spires almost too small to be seen,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">microscopic, a complex web swimming</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">within the hollow glass globe. A web of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">spires. A City.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Erick put the globe into the case and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">snapped it shut. "Let's go," he said. They</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">began to lope back through the trees, back</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the way they had come before. "We'll</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">change in the car," he said as they ran.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"I think wc should keep these clothes on</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">until we're actually inside the car. We still</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">might encounter someone."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I'U be glad to get my own clothing on</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">again," Jan said. "I feel funny in these little</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pants."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How do you think I feel?" Mara</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">gasped. "I'm freezing in this, what there</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">is of it.M</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"All young Martian brides dress that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">way," Erick said. He clutched the case</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tightly as they ran. "I think it looks fine."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Thank you," Mara said, "but it is cold."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What do you suppose they'll think?"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Jan asked. "They'll assume the City was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">destroyed, won't they? That's certain/''</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Yes,"" Erick said. "They'll be sure it</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was blown up. We can count on that. And</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it will be damn important to us that they</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">think so!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The car should be around here, some-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">place," Mara said, slowing down.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">No. Farther on," Erick said. "Past that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">little hill over there. In the ravine, by the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">trees. It's so hard to see where we are."</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Shall I light something?" Jan said.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No. There may be patrols around</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">who--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He halted abruptly. Jan and Mara stopped</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beside him. "What--" Mara began.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A light glimmered. Something stirred in</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the darkness. There was a sound.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Quick!" Erick rasped. He dropped,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">throwing the case far away from him, into</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the bushes. He straightened up tensely.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A figure loomed up, moving through the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">darkness, and behind it came more figures,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">men, soldiers in uniform. The light flashed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">up brightly, blinding them. Erick closed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his eyes. The light left him, touching Mara</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and Jan, standing silently together, clasp-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing hands. Then it flickcd down to the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ground and around in a circle.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A Leiter stepped forward, a tall figure</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in black, with his soldiers close behind him,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their guns ready. "You three," the Leiter</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said. "Who are you? Don't move. Stand</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">where you are."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He came up to Erick, peering at him in-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tently, his hard Martian face without ex-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pression. He went all around Erick, exam-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ining his robes, his sleeves.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Please--" Erick began in a quavering</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">voice, but the Leiter cut him off.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I'll do the talking. Who are you three?</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">What are you doing here? Speak up."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We--we are going back to our vil-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">lage," Erick muttered, staring down, his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hands folded. "We were in the City, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">now we are going home."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">One of the soldiers spoke into a mouth-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">piece. He clicked it off and put it away.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Come with me," the Leiter said. "We're</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">taking you in. Hurry along."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"In? Back to the City?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">One of the soldiers laughed. "The City</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is gone," he said. "All that's left of it you</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">can put in the palm of your hand."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But what happened?" Mara said.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No one knows. Come on, hurry it up!"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">64 b</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was a sound. A soldier came</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">quickly out of the darkness. "A Senior</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Leiter," he said. "Coming this way." He</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">disappeared again.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">** A SENIOR Leiter." The soldiers stood</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">xA. waiting, standing at a respectful</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">attention. A moment later the Senior Leiter</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stepped into the light, a black-clad old man,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his ancient face thin and hard, like a bird's,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">eyes bright and alert. He looked from</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Erick to Jan.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Who are these people?" he demanded.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Villagers going back home."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No they're not. They don't stand like</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">villagers. Villagers slump--diet, poor food.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">These people are not villagers. I myself</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">came from the hills, and I know."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He stepped close to Erick, looking keenly</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">into his face. "Who are you? Look at his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">chin-- he never shaved with a sharpened</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stone! Something is wrong here."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In his hand a rod of pale lire flashed.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"The City is gone, and with it at least half</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the Leiter Council. It is very strange, a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">flash, then heat, and a wind. But it was not</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fission. I am puzzled. All at once the City</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">has vanished. Nothing is left but a depres-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sion in the sand."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We'll take them in," the other Leiter</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">said. "Soldiers, surround them. Make</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">certain that--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Run!" Erick cried. He struck out,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">knocking the rod from the Senior Leiter's</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hand. They were all running, soldiers shout-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing, flashing their lights, stumbling against</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">each other in the darkness. Erick dropped</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to his knees, groping frantically in the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">bushes. His fingers closed over the handle</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of the case and he leaped up. In Terran he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">shouted to Mara and Jan.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Hurry! To the car! Run!" He set off,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">down the slope, stumbling through the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">darkness. He could hear soldiers behind</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him, soldiers running and falling. A body</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">collided against him and he struck out.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Someplace behind him there was a hiss, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a section of the slope went up in flames.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">The Leiter's rod--</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Erick," Mara cried from the darkness.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">He ran toward her. Suddenly he slipped,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">falling on a stone. Confusion and firing.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">The sound of excited voices.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Erick, is that you?" Jan caught hold of</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him, helping him up. "The car. It's over</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">here. Where's Mara?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I'm here," Mara's voice came. "Over</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">here, by the car."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A light flashed. A tree went up in a puff</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of fire, and Erick felt the singe of the heat</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">against his face. He and Jan made their</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">way toward the girl. Mara's hand caught</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his in the darkness.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Now the car," Erick said. "If they</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">haven't got to it." He slid down the slope</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">into the ravine, fumbling in the darkness,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">reaching and holding onto the handle of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">case. Reaching, reaching--</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He touched something cold and smooth.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Metal, a metal door handle. Relief flooded</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">through him. "I've found it! Jan, get inside.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Mara, come on." He pushed Jan past him,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">into the car. Mara slipped in after Jan, her</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">small agile body crowding in beside him.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Stop!" a voice shouted from above.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"There's no use hiding in that ravine. We'll</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">get you! Come up and--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The sound of voices was drowned out by</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the roar of the car's motor A moment later</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">they shot into the darkness, the car rising</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">into the air. Treetops broke and cracked</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">under them as Erick'turned the car from</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">side to side, avoiding the groping shafts of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pale light from below, the last furious</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">thrusts from the two Leiters and their sol-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">diers.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then they were away, above the trees,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">high in the air, gaining speed each moment,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">leaving the knot of Martians far behind.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Toward Marsport," Jan said to Erick.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Right?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Erick nodded. "Yes. We'll land outside</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the field, in the hills. We can change back</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to our regular clothing there, our commer-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cial clothing. Damn it-- we'll be lucky if</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">we can get there in time for the ship."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The last ship," Mara whispered, her</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">chest rising and falling. "What if we don't</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">get there in time?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Erick looked down at the leather case in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his lap. "We'll have to get there," he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">murmured. "We must!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">FOR a long time there was silence.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Thacher stared at Erickson. The older</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">man was leaning back in his chair, sipping</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a little of his drink. Mara and Jan were</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">silent.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">THE CRYSTAL CRYPT</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">65</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">So you didn't destroy the City,"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Thacher said. "You didn't destroy it at all.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">You shrank it down and put it in a glass</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">globe, in a paperweight. And now you're</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">salesmen again, with a sample case of office</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">supplies!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Erickson smiled. He opened the briefcase</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and reaching into it he brought out the glass</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">globe paperweight. He held it up, looking</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">into it. "Yes, we stole the City from the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Martians. That's how we got by the lie</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">detector. It was true that we knew nothing</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">about a destroyed City."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But why?" Thacher said. "Why steal a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">City? Why not merely bomb it?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Ransom," Mara said fervently,- gazing</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">into the globe, her dark eyes bright. "Their</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">biggest City, half of their Council-- in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Erick's hand!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Mars will have to do what Terra asks,"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Erickson said. "Now Terra will be able to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">make her commercial demands felt. Maybe</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">there won't even be a war. Perhaps Terra</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">will get her way without fighting." Still</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">smiling, he put the globe back into the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">brief case and locked it.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Quite a story," Thacher said. "What an</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">amazing process, reduction of size-- A</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">whole City reduced to microscopic dimen-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sions. Amazing. No wonder you were able</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to escape. With such daring as that, no one</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">could hope to stop you."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He looked down at the brief case on the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">floor. Underneath them the jets murmured</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and vibrated evenly, as the ship moved</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">through space toward distant Terra.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We still have quite a way to go," Jan</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">said. "You've heard our story, Thacher.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Why not tell us yours? What sort of line</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">are you in? What's your business?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes,'' Mara said. ' What do you do?"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"What do I do?" Thacher said. "Well,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">if you like, I'll show you." He reached into</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his coat and brought out something. Some-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">thing that flashed and glinted, something</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">slender. A rod of pale fire.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The three stared at it. Sickened shock</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">settled over them slowly.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Thacher held the rod loosely, calmly,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pointing it at Erickson. "We knew you three</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">were on this ship," he said. "There was no</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">doubt of that. But we did not know what</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had become of the City. My theory was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that the City had not been destroyed at all,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that something else had happened to it.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Council instruments measured a sudden loss</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of mass in that area, a decrease equal to the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mass of the City. Somehow the City had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">been spirited away, not destroyed. But I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">could not convince the other Council Leiters</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">swept his face. "Why didn't you tell me the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Kastil was so close, Scott? Why did you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tell me to try light on the cats when you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">knew--•"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Scott told you!" Elderburg snarled. But</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">at that moment Scott cried out sharply,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pointing out through the port by the air</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">lock.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Two miles beyond the Berthat settled a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">black cigar. Bluewhite fire flared from its</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">base. The Kastil!" Scott gasped. Useless</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">rage flooded his chest. 'The Kastil--and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">she's found us!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">UNDER the hurtling jet, the surface of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the asteroid was a jagged tangle of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stone. Scott, staring tensely from the ob-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">servation port, felt a swift moment of won-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">der. Two hours since the IPM ship had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">landed. And he was in trouble with a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">vengeance.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As lie had left the ship with a party of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">picked men, he had felt Elderburg's cold</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">eyes on him. Eyes that thought -- and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">threatened.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was easy enough to read the Old Man's</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mind. An officer might make one vital mis-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">take. But not two--not introducing the cats</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">into the ship; not permitting a flare to be</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">set off. Unless. . . .</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Unless he wanted the Bertha to lose time.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Unless he wanted the Kastil to find the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">precious claim.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Cold raced through Scott's veins. His</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hands locked white about the space helmet</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he was about to don. He had to prove his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">loyalty. Had to prove that the accidents</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">70</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">were accidents. And little time was left, as</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the Kastil could load completely in two</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">days.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"There's the pit, Mister Jerill." The navi-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">gator's voice was strained. "See anybody?"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Not yet. Set her down."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The cargo jet dipped. The vast peaks of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">shattered stone sped up at them with ter-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">rifying speed. Scott refrained from closing</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his eyes, saw the razor-toothed surface of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">this shattered world streak toward him.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Ahead, the bulk of the Kastil loomed. They</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">must have used the ore pits as a landing</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">narker, he thought. And--what was that?</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Motion at the lip of the ore pit.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The jet grounded hissing on the burnt</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">landing strip. "Watch it," Scott warned.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"We got visitors out there."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was an ugly muttering among the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">men. As Scott threw open the cargo doors</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and dropped to the rocky ground, he saw</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the crewmen checking blasters and the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">slender polonium tubes that could perma-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nently blind a man.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He stepped away from the jet. And as he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">did so. seven men detached themselves from</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the shadows about the mine's edge, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">strolled toward him. Seven men--two more</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">than were with Scott. The odds might be</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">worse, he thought with a sense of relief.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Cautiously, he loosened the blaster in his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">belt. They were tricky weapons to handle</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in space gloves, but he'd better be ready to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">use it fast.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Party from the Bertha?" The words</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">came thin and metallic into Scott's helmet.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Right," he grunted. "You?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"From the Kastil. Who gave you a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">clearance to land on our claim?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We have a prior claim on this pit," Scott</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">flared. "We have it posted and registered. If</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">you're going to mine, find someplace else."</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">A giant figure, grimly grotesque in a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cumbersome vacuum suit, swaggered for-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ward. "I don't see any of your claim posts."</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Scott indicated a tall metal stake glitter-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing somberly in the glare of the jet's load-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing lights.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The tall man laughed easily, his voicc</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">thin and far away in Scott's helmet. "Think</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of a better story. We just dug that claimer</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in ourselves. Now suppose you people jet</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">out of here. Ought to be plenty of good</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">claims someplace else."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Scott scarcely heard the sudden bitter</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">burst of protest from his men. His body felt</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">light and cool. The blaster pressed hard</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">against his side. "There are plenty of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">good claims," he said. "You better go find</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">them."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He swung the blaster up in a single</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">smooth motion.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The tall man stood very still. They were</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">not close enough to see each other's faces.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then, high on a plateau of stone above</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the tall man's head, Scott saw the stats</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">blot out.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Scatter!' As he shouted, he took a giant</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">leap to the right.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A blast of energy seared from the dark-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ness. gouging a vast hole where Scott bad</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stood.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">From behind a boulder he could see the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fire of the blaster sweep across the upper</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">edges of the rocks, just at the level where</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the stars were cut off.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">For a moment, the cold green line of his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fire flicked harmlessly over naked stone.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Then a thick squirt of fire flared quickly. A</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">still-born scream died in his earphones.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The men of the Kastil had dodged away</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">into the darkness.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Scott's voice rang out harshly. "I'll give</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">you men two minutes to organize and get</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">out of here. If you're not out by that time,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">we'll spin our jet around and burn you out."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was a brief stir off in the shadows.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You're in a blind alley there," Scott</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">continued. "There's no way out. And we'll</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">blast any man who tries to climb out over</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the rocks. Is that clear?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A glowing flash of energy exploded</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">against the rock protecting him. There was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">no sound, but bits of stone lightly flecked</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his suit. Scott braced himself on the rough</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">face of the boulder and worked the blaster</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">around for an open shot.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No more shooting," the heavy voice of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the tall man growled. "You Bertha people.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Can you hear me?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Yes, Scott said coldly. His eyes probed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the shadows for motion.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We're willing to be peaceful about this.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">I'm Captain Randell of the Kastil. There's</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">no need for killing when there's plenty of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ore for all of us."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Not in this pit," Scott answered. "You</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">have one minute."</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">FELINE RED</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">71</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">All right." Randell's voice, distorted as</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it was by the tiny radio, carried a sardonic</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">edge. ''We'll go--from here."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He sauntered out of the shadows, hands</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">upraised. From the tangle of stone, his men</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">crept out to join him. Without haste, inso-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">lent in their retreat, they crossed over the</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pifc-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">At the far side they paused. 'This is the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">extent of your so-called claim." Randell's</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">voice purred in their ears. "Our claim ex-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tends from this line. And if a man from</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the Bertha wants a quick blasting, he can</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cross this line." His radio snapped off with</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">crisp finality.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Scott stepped from his shelter.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">' All right," he ordered. "You men know</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the story. The Kastil's down here ready for</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">work. And it's going to mean work if we're</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">going to beat her back to Earth. Now, let's</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">go. But watch your step."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">THEY worked. Eighteen hours a day</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">they worked. From the steel-like ground</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">they scoopcd a dozen tons of the, dirty</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">black uranium ore and sent it hurtling</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">back to the Bertha.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But in spite of all their efforts, the more</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">modern equipment of the Kaslil overtook</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">them in a day. The blackness on their left</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was riddled with the flare of digging</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">torches and the slender fire-trails of the jets</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">soaring between the pit and the Kastil,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And now and again, Randell's drawling</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">voicc broke into Scott's ears. "You're slow-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing, up, Bertha. Seventy tons for us today.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Are you poor little men getting tired?" He</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">clucked sympathetically, then burst into a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">yell of laughter. "We'll have the ore cleaned</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">off this rock before you get half loaded."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But Scott and the men of the Bertha</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">worked silently, with savage haste, for-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">getting sleep and food to keep the tonnage</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">flowing to their ship. They had almost</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">forgotten the cats. . . .</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But not for long.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Staggering with fatigue, Scott swayed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">into Central Control, and sagged into a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">seat. He had been too long in a space suit.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">A dull pounding beat behind his eyes. "I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">came as soon as you called the pit, Captain</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Elderburg. You sounded pretty urgent."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It's urgent," Elderburg said. "We're</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">beaten."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Scott stiffened. Fatigue fell from him as</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he gazed closely at the Captain, saw for</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the first time the bitter dullness of Elder-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">burg's eyes.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You better come with me," the Old Mar-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">said heavily. He rose stiffly, led the way</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">from the room.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In silence they shuffled down the corri-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dor toward the engine room. A tic worked</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">at the corner of the Captain's mouth, but</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he did not seem to notice it. "Durval held</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the cats off with ultra-sonics. He purified</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">about ten tons of the stuff and stored it."</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">They threaded their way along a chill</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">black catwalk to the center of the ship. In</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the engine room, men slumped sullenly</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">among the big atomics. As Scott and Elder-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">burg passed a group of the black gang,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mutely dangling wrenches, there was a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sudden stir.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That's him!" One of the men had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">leaped up. The wrench whipped back over</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his shoulder. He leaped raging toward</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Scott. "There's the rotten. . . /'</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Easy, Billy." He was dragged back,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">disarmed.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How'd the Kastil know. . . .**</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Captain tugged Scott's arm. "Don't</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">bother with them. Come on."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Scott nodded numbly, followed, his head</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">aching and a nameless wave of apprehen-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sion sliding through him. "Where are the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cats?" he asked once.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Elderburg ignored him. "Put on a radia-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tion suit."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They had stopped before a side door of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the main hold. As Scott struggled into the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">suit his mind swirled in a chaos of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">thoughts. When the suit was adjusted he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dropped the helmet shut and stepped for-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ward. Through the lighter gravity of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">air lock they lumbered. Then Ekkrburg</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">spun the controls that opened the door.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"There you are," he said to Scott. He</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sounded completely deflated. No sting re-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mained in his voice.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Scott stepped forward into the hold, then</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">froze. His body went cold.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The hold was a writhing mass of cats.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Their queer angled bodies darted in a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">great pile beyond the door. Their red</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">bodies glowed and twisted strangely. They</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">flew about a huge stack of lead containers--</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">uranium cells secured for the long trip home.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">72</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And Scott went sick with understanding.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Through rigid lips, he forced the words:</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">''Energy-eaters!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Captain laughed oddly. "And you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">wondered how they lived on this naked</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">rock. They ate the raw ore, of course. No</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">wonder they hung around Durval's ma-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">chines sucking up what free energy they</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">could. They broke through the air feeder</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">system here. No wonder. With cells of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">80% pure uranium waiting for them." His</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">voice broke.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"So we're finished," he continued. "The</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Kastil will be loaded before we can even</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">clean the cats out. We're done."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He swayed back against the bulkhead.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Scott took his arm.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Get away from me." Elderburg</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">wrenched away, his loathing clear even be-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hind the bulky suit. "If what the men say</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">is true. If you sold us out--" His voice</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">trailed off. "Call your men out of the pits,</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">THEY crammed into the observation</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">blasters with unsteady hands, a black fury</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Right, lieutenant. What's up?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Piracy." He spun toward the door. Then</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A picture was forming on the Master</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Elderburg pounded to his side. "Who</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">the figure on the screen said, and Scott</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">needed no further introduction.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was Randell, master of the ship Kastil.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"We've had a very entertaining two</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">easily together. "It's been a real pleasure</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">pleasure is over. We're leaving you now.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Oh, that disturbance at your mine pit?" He</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">laughed, but only with his mouth; the close-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">set eyes remained unchanging, watchful.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"It seemed so unnecessary to bother mining</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">men at the mine contracted space-sickness,</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He began to chuckle. "I think the ore</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The screen went gray. The sound shut</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Made of lead and six feet deep."</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">He whirled away from Scott, slammed</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Scott slashed his blaster hard across the</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">hit him again. Elderburg's legs went loose.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">He toppled face forward, struck the inter-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">inside.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">THE hold was beastly hot. Standing inside</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the hatchway, holding suspended over</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his head a three-foot long cell of uranium</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ore, Scott felt a moment of shuddering</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">panic. Over the storage cells along the wall,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">over the tumbling bodies of the cats, an</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">eerie glow quivered--the menacing flare</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of radio-activity.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Scott glanced nervously at the forward</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">screen. Chief Durval waved toward him.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Your men ready, Durval?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Chief nodded. "Don't go getting</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">yourself hurt now, Scott."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Scott grinned although he did not feel</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">much like grinning.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He shuffled forward under the light</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">gravity of the hold. The uranium cell bal-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">anced easily in his hands. Too easily. He</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">could scarcely feel it press against his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">gloves. The heat control in his suit was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">jammed again. His hands streamed sweat.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">He inched past the cats. A quick cold</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">thrill passed through his stomach. With tin.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">energy of the ore almost gone, the scarlet</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">beasts were growing increasingly uneasy.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">They were casting about for a new supply.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">It would be easy enough for a foot to slip,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he thought. To spill the ore across the floor.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">New food for the cats--and the loss of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Bertha's last chance as strange space beasts</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sucked away the last purified ore.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He slipped cautiously past the last row</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of cells. A quick dash now for the open</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hatchway beyond. . . .</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Half a dozen of the bounding red beasts</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">surged about his feet. Their weight drove</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his right leg forward. He staggered, caught</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">at his balance. The lead cell above his head</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">began to slip.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Watch it, Scott!" Durval's voice cracked</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in his ears.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Straining every muscle against the queer</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">weightlessness of no gravity, Scott struggled</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">**T tlgain his balance. He expected another</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">blow at his legs as the cats leaped for the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ore. It was hard to breathe the over-heated</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">air of his suit.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But the cats had spun away. As he caught</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his balance, he stared after them, uncompre-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hending for an instant. The cats ran twist-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing in a somehow sinister dance. The</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">bodies were queerly bloated. Down the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">upper portion of their bodies ran a heavy</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">indentation. As they leaped and twisted, ih'c-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">indentation became a fissure, a crevice.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then two of the beasts leaped, slammed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">together in mid-air. But more than two cats</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fell to the floor.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Their sharply angled bodies whisking</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">back toward the depleted uranium cells,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">four cats appeared with shocking sudden-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ness.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Reproduction. Elemental fission.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Scott had to clean them out, and fast.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Soon the ship would be overrun with the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">energy-hungry felines.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He dashed toward the open hatch. Out-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">side the opening, a great lead box, eight</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">feet by eight feet, gaped upward. Beyond,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">four men tensely supported a vast lead</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cover.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Is the uranium poured into the box?"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he barked sharply.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">*'Yes5 sir. All ready, Mister Jerill."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Good." Turning from the hatch, he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">inverted his cell, poured out the uranium</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ore in a thick stream from the open hatch</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">back across the hold toward the scrambling</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mass of cats upon the now empty rows of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cells.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But he never reached the beasts.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A brawling torrent of animals leaped</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">toward him. Hurling the container into</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">their mass, he leaped to one side. They</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">lunged into the trail of ore. Rolled, leaped,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">■darted along the line. At the hatch edge,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">t pyramiding mass of cats paused a moment.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Then plummeted over. Scott fell back</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">against the bulkhead, his eyes fixed on the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cits still scavenging among the empty cells.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then these too were darting for the trail</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of ore. The uranium was scattered now. Cats</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">plunged toward the new radiation in the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">box beyond the hold entrance.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The inarticulate cheers of Durval and his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">men rang in Scott's helmet. But his mind</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was already working at the next step of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">problem.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Durval," he ordered. "Get a decontami-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Past the hatch, he saw the swift flash of</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He swung frem the cargo entrance to the</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">THE pounding of the jets matched the</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">Staggering over the uneven ground, they</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Is it?" Randell turned carelessly to his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">men. "Property of the Bertha," he drawled.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Well, we'd better have a look at it now.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">To make sure you haven't accidentally sal-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">The men of the Bertha fell back. Their</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Randell chuckled. "Perhaps it's just as</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">He flicked the muzzle of the blaster</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">Triumph leaped through Scott. "This is</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">piracy," he said, and sounded sincere.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Piracy is what is proven," Randell</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">laughed. "Do you really think you have a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">case in our courts?" He sighed softly.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Now, thank you for this unexpected</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pleasure. And good-bye. We'll see each</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">other again on Earth, perhaps."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then they were gone and immediately</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">afterward, the Kastil, balancing on a white</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">and flashed out past the stars.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Scott stared after it, a faint smile touch-</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">voice was unsteady. "How did you do it?'*</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Pretended to be taking something of</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">Orders have come through and we're pull-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing the battalion out. We're ordered back</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to Little Texas. We're going to give up</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">these positions along the river tonight and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pull back into Dust Bin. The Sun Maid will</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stand by to evacuate us. You people are to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">come too. Everybody has to get out, both</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the military and civilians. All hell's broken</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">loose down river. The Rumi are across the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Muddy in half a dozen places. They've cut</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the 5 th to pieces. New Chicago thinks that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">those cats have been bringing troops in from</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">both sides not to do so. And now they have</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Is there any action along our front,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Major?" Terrence asked quickly, hoping to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stop the flow of talk before Chapelle's</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hysteria communicated itself to the enlisted</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">men who were sitting or lying about the</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">The Colonel says for Norton to have every-</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">destroyed. Everything's got to go, everything</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">we can't take along. The Sun Maid won't</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">have time for more than one trip. He wants</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">Terrence put down the microphone ray</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">carefully to keep from slamming it down</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and stalked back into his quarters. Angrily</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">across the makeshift native huts, he could</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">see the bright sides of a huge space ship-like</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">object. The big dirigible Sun Maid was lying</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in an open field. It's a funny world, he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">thought to himself, where you have to use</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">gible was the only practical aircraft when</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Narakan Rifle? were marching toward</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him now, the band doing absolutely nothing</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">for The Wearing of the Green. Three hun-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dred big, green bodied, beady eyed, frog-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">like creatures were marching in the boiling</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">heat with their non-coms croaking out</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As they marched by him, he snapped a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">salute. Watching them closely he tried to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">find two men who were in step with each</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">other or one man who had his rifle at the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">right angle. Unable to find either, he stood</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">there conscious of failure; failure which</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">went beyond mere military precision how-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ever, Sloppiness at review could have been</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">overlooked if he had been able to find that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the Narakans had any ability as fighting</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">men but after a year of training they seemed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">almost as hopeless as they had at first. It</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">wasn't that they were completely unintelli-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">gent. In fact, other than the Galactic travel-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing Rumi, they were the only extra-solar</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">race of intelligent beings encountered by</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">man so far. It was just, he thought, that the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hundreds of years during which the Rumi</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had dominated their planet had reduced the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Narakans to a state of almost complete</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">three times because he knew that his pres-</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">turned, and with dragging feet made his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">way down Dust Bin's single street toward</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Government House.</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">rummaging through some papers while</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Norris and Mrs. Wilson were lounging in</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They took the news just as he expected</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">sparse, gray hair and murmured something</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">about it being a shame to have to leave</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the natives on their own after having more</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">or less dragged them out of their com-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fortable swamps. A glance from his wife</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">silenced him.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What the hell," Norris said, "they're</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Wilson yawned, It'll be something</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of a bother packing but it'll certainly be a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pleasure to get back to New Chicago. Some</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">women's husbands get good posts in half-</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">know why I should always have to be stuck</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in every backwater, hick town there is."</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Wilson smiled apologetically, "Now,</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">the sudden ringing of the telephone on the</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">''Get that, will you, O'Mara?" the captain</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">said, making 110 attempt to reach for it, "It's</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Terrence put the phone to his ear angrily</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and growled into it. An excited Bill Field-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing was on the line. "Terry? Is that you?</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Fielding here. Hell's breaking loose. There's</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a bunch of blasted Rumi trying to force</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">their way into town. They attacked the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sentries down this way and may be heading</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">for your end of town too.''</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Terrence dropped the phone and headed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">for the door. ' Rumi!" lie shouted and there</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">were shouts and cries from outside in an-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">swer. Then he heard the clack, clack, clack</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of Rumi spring guns. Windows of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">room crashed in and Wilson collapsed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">across his desk. Norton grabbed Mrs. Wil-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">son and pulled her down onto the floor.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Terrence dropped to his hands and knees</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and continued toward the door as he drew</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his forty-five.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">SOMEWHERE, someone had cut loose</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">with a Banning and its high whine</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">drowned out the clack of the spring guns.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">With a quick look around, Terrence started</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">at a run for the next building which was the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">native schoolhouse. He didn't make it.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">There was a clack, clack from oif to his left</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and he threw himself forward, skidding</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and sliding in the dust and gravel of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">street. A warehouse across the square was</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">on fire and three Rumi had darted from</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">behind it. In one brief glance he saw those</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">long barreled spring guns of theirs and the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tall, graceful bodies and the feline faces</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">under the plastic protective clothing.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He snapped four shots at them and saw</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">one fall. Then he began to slither along the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ground raising enough dust to mask his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">movements. There were half a dozen of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">them in the square when he reached the rear</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">door of the schoolhouse. Several gleaming</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">plastic bolts smashed into the wooden outer</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">door a second after he had raised up to open</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it and then had dropped back down.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Norton fired from the residency and mo-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mentarily scattered the Rumi and Terrence</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was inside the school room and racing for</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the side window from which lie could get</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a clear line of fire at the raiders. He had a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">brief glimpse of Joan Allen, the school</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">teacher, standing in a corner of the room</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">with the tiny green figures of native chil-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dren huddled around her. Then he was at</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a window and had beaten out the heavy pro-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tective glass and was firing into a mass of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the catmen, firing and cursing as his gun</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">emptied. He cursed in a stream of Martian,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">English and Greenback profanity as he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">forced another clip into the gun.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Lieutenant O'Mara, if you'll be so kind</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">as to restrain your language in front of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">these children," a voice said from over his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">shoulder.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Terrence reached back and felt something</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">soft and forced it over against the wall out</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of the line of the window. Then he risked</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a quick look which was almost his last. A</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">spring gun bolt burned a groove in the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">windowsill next to his head and smashed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">into the blackboard across the room.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Lieutenant O'Mara, would you mind</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">telling me what this is all about?" came the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">same calm determined woman's voice from</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">beside him. He fired again at a darting</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">figure across the square and saw it stumble</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">before he had to drop to his haunches as</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the window above him was smashed and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">scattered by bolts and glass rained down</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">about his head.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He put another clip into his gun and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cursed because he had only two left. He</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">as the Terrans called them was clinging</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">desperately to the teacher's skirt. His tiny</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">webbed feet clutched at the cloth as be</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">buried his face against her leg. From behind</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">her peered still another child, its'baby frog</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">face working spasmodically in the begin-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nings of a sob. Six or seven others were lying</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Terrence took another look outside and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">what he saw sent him into another stream</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">of the street they came in a column of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fours with their drums and bugles blaring</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">out a poor imitation of The Wearing of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Green. Their standard bearer was running</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">at the head of the column beside Sergeant</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Teacher, will you shut up!" he roared as</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he leaped across the room toward the front</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Terrence braced his body against the wall</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">found O'Shaughnessy lying almost beside</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him, squinting along his carbine. Hie Nara-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">kan's face split into two replicas of the map</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of Ireland and he saluted flat handed, his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">webbed fingers at just the proper angle.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"O'Shaughnessy, you don't have to salute</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">when you're lying down!" O'Mara tried to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">keep his voice as calm as possible.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, sir, Mr. Lieutenant. Pretty quick</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">we fight now?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">His lieutenant ignored him and searched</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">for signs of life in the houses across the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">square. There wasn't a Rumi in sight except</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">for one on the roof of a shed next to the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">burning warehouse. He tried a couple of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">shots with his automatic and missed. He</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">grabbed O'Shaughnessy's carbine and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dropped the creature as it tried to scramble</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">off the shed.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Pretty soon we fight with bayonet?"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">O'Shaughnessy asked as Terrence handed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">back the carbine.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"O'Shaughnessy, why do you do things</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">like this to me, me who took you out of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">your damn mud hole and made a soldier</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">out of you?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">O'Shaughnessy's mouth formed a huge</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">round moon, "Not understand, Lieuten-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ant. ..." he began but he was ignored again</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">as Terrence stared across the street in pained</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">disbelief to where the heavy weapons squad</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of the Narakan Rifles was gathered in a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">huddled group behind a native house,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">struggling to set up their Banning Auto-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">matic Blaster and two machine guns. One</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ot the men was down on his hands and</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">knees balancing the heavy barrel of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">blaster on his back while two others were</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">attempting to push the ponderous breech</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">onto it by main strength. The two machine</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">guns were half on and half oft their tripods.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">The leg of one of them had been bent in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the wrong direction and the other was so</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">covered with grease that the parts wouldn t</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fit together.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, Lord!" moaned Terrence and was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">bracing himself for a dash across the street</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">when a figure in Terran battle armor came</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">around the building on the run, dodging</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and crawling as spring bolts raised the dust</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in front of him. It was the short, stout Gun-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nery Sergeant, Polasky. Terrence breathed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a sigh of relief.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He turned to O'Shaughnessy, "Now,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Sergeant, this is our problem. Those build-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ings over there are filled with Rumi. They</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">have automatic weapons . . . spring guns</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">firing a clip of twenty plastic bolts. They're</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">deadly at close to medium range. They can</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">penetrate our battle armor." He looked at</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the thick, knobby skin of the Narakan,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Yours too. Now, they are probably just a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">patrol about the size of one of our com-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">panies. They don't seem to have any heavy</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">weapons and ours will be in action in a few</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">minutes. Then, O'Shaughnessy. . . The</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Narakan was squinting along the barrel of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his rifle.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Are you paying attention, Sergeant?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, sir! Attention, yes, sir." O'Shaugh-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nessy started to lift his bulky three hundred</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pounds up off the ground. Terrence heaved</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">with all his might against those thick khaki</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">clad legs to knock him down again.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Man, what are you doing?" he yelled.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Attention, sir. Sir said . .</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No, no, O'Shaughnessy. I meant, listen</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to me. O'Shaughnessy, how could you?</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Haven't I been like a brother to you? Didn't</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">I share my whiskey and candy ration with</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">you?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, sir. That's why . .</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, sir."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Look. In a minute our Banning will be</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in action," his voice was drowned out by</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the scream of tortured air as the Banning</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cut loose. "Now there is a sweet sound.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">What do we do next, O'Shaughnessy?"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">NARAKAN RIFLES, ABOUT FACE!</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">One of the row of buildings across the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">square glowed red briefly as the beam from</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the Blaster caught it; glowed red and then</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">burst into a ball of fire. O'Shaughnessy's</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mouth was open wide, his chinless face</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">resting on the edge of the sandbox and his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">little black bead eyes were as large as they</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">could get.</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">O'Mara slapped him on the seat of his</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">stuff straight."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The whine of the Banning interrupted</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him again and it was joined by the chattcr</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of machine guns and rifle fire and answered</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">by the rapid clacking of spring guns. Bolts</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dug into the wall of the schoolhouse and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">showered them with plaster. Others shat-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tered the front window. Terrence wiped</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">plaster off his visor and tried again. "You've</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">got to get this straight, O'Shaughnessy,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">because . . . well, because you may be</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">getting an independent command pretty</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">soon and there won't be anyone around to</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Narakan was listening to him</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">but wide-mouthed and uncomprehending.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"We're going to bum them out of those</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">huts; burn them out or burn the houses</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">down over their heads. About the time</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Polasky gets to the third one, those guys are</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">going to break and then they'll either rush</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">us or . .</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Norton was yelling something from the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Residency. There was a noise of clanking</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">armor behind him and he could hear Field-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing's voice cracking out orders as he came</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">up with twenty hastily armed and armored</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">clerks, cooks and radiomen from the HQ</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"O'Mara! O'Mara, they're breaking!</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">They're running! Let's go!" Norton was on</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the porch of the Residency pouring Tommy</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">houses.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">''Okay, let's go." Terrence said, lurching</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to his feet. The Narakan sergeant blew his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">whistle and the riflemen swarmed out from</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">their shelters and started at a run across</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the square with Norton, Terrence and</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">O'Shaughnessy at their head. The rest of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the Terrans in full battle armor lumbered</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">along after them.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">One or two bolts whistled overhead and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Corporal O'Brien dropped his rifle and fell</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">forward clutching his leg. The smoke from</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the burning buildings obscured their vision</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">but Terrence had a momentary sight of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Rumi radiation clothing and emptied his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">clip at it.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Someone from behind threw a grenade</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">which fell short of its target and rolled in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">front of them. Norton took two quick</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">strides and kicked it into one of the flaming</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">THERE were about twenty Rumi, less</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">than they had thought, fleeing across the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">open fields behind the burning huts. They</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">were firing as they ran and giving out those</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">queer yelping cries of theirs. Three or four</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of them fell and then Norton was shouting*</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">calling back his men to organize fire fight-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing parties.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Captain! Captain, let's go after those</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">guys. We can cut them oft before they get</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to the grasslands," Terrence yelled.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Get your men after these fires, O'Mara.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">We can't let them spread."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was nothing to do but obey but he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">delayed long enough to empty his automatic</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in the general direction of the fleeing Rumi.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Then he turned and yelled, "Harrigan!</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Sergeant Harrigan! Where in the devil is</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that . . There was a crashing sound</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">behind him and Harrigan stumbled through</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the smoke and came down on his foot, all</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">three hundred pounds of him.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Later, as the last smoking embers of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fire were being smothered by industrious</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">squads of Narakans with buckets and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">shovels, Terrence limped back across the</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We should have gone after those lousy</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">course, we're going to burn all these build-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fielding took his heavy battle helmet off</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">Surprise spread across Bill's freckled face,</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Terrence muttered a few old Anglo-Saxon</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">the direction of the school building.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">THE Reverend Ames Goodman was the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">smallest Narakan that Terrence had ever</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">seen. The Johnathian missionary from Little</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Texas was somewhat under two hundred</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and fifty pounds which was slight for a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Greenback. He also spoke the best English</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">except for some of the big shots in New</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Chicago.^ Ordinarily he was a composite of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">supcrst:Jous reverence and natural dignity</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">which Terrence had always found admir-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">able. Today, however, he couldn't have</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">appeared more ludicrous if he had tried.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">He was dressed for a visit to the Residency</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in a white duck suit which was too small</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and out of which he bulged in a number of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">surprising places.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He and Joan Allen were talking half in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Engliih and half in Narakan as the lieu-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tenant entered. The minister had a painfully</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">surprised look on his round green face.</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I hope we didn't bust up your school</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">For the first time in the six months that she</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had been in charge of the orphan school in</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dust Bin, Terrence decided that maybe she</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was pretty after all. He wasn't sure whether</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it was the high color which excitement lent</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to her usually pale face or if Bill Fielding</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was right in saying he had been on Naraka</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">too long, but Joan Allen was beginning to</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">look good to him. At the moment the</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">' Is it true that the Defense Force is</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Terrence took off his helmet and let the</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">O'Mara somehow couldn't quite look</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">O'Shaughnessy shivered at the dire threat</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">Swamps composed of a sticky, gray mud</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">The column which had left the civilians at</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the edge of the swamp was pushing slowly</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">forward. The Narakans glided along on</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">their bare, webbed feet and the Terrans</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pushed along on snowshoe-like glides</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Later in the night, with a good ten miles</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">THE next day's march was a nightmare</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to the lieutenant. If anything, the heat</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and humidity were worse in the swamps</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">than they had been in Dust Bin and the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">going got tougher every mile. The mud was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">softer and the undergrowth had to be cut</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">away by bayonet-wielding Narakans before</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the main body could move through. Ter-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">rence had thrown off his battle armor and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">lost his radiation helmet somewhere in the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">morass as had other of the Earthmen. Han-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nigan had prepared a thick mess of mud</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and grass which the Terrans applied to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">exposed parts of their bodies.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Late in the afternoon of the second day</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the Narakan Rifles came to a tepid little</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stream that marked the end of the swamps,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and for the first time Terrence ordered a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">rest of longer than two hours. Bill Fielding</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was lying flat on his back in the grass</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">beside the stream with his feet dangling in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the water, shoes and all, when O'Mara</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dragged himself wearily back from inspect-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"If I never to my dying day see another</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, Lord!" moaned O'Mara, "now it</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">carbine and running bent over. Fielding</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was at his heels, dragging a machine gun</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Terrence had plunged into the stream and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">splashed across and was clambering up the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">opposite bank when one of his pickets came</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">crawling and stumbling back clutching a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">wounded arm. "Mr. Lieutenant! Mr. Lieu-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Medic! Medic!" O'Shaughnessy was yell-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing in his ear with the full-throated croak</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of an adult Narakan, drowning out what</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the wounded picket was trying to say.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How many? How many Rumi, man?"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Terrence demanded.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Twenty . . . thirty . . . maybe thousand!"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tlie Narakan gasped as the Medic led him</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">While his men dragged their big bodies</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">up the bank of the stream, O'Mara stood</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">scowling at the eight foot high grass.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Usually about a foot high, the hardy and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ubiquitous purple grass of Naraka grew</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">far more lushly around the edges of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">swamps. He felt that it would be a risky</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">business at best to plunge into it after an</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">unknown number of enemy. At the same</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">time he had an illogical determination not</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to leave the bodies of his men in the hands</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of the Rumi. He looked at the broad, big-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mouthed exaggerations of Irish faces around</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him, heaved a sigh that came from deep in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his chest and ordered, "All right, men.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Spread out. Keep low and keep your eyes</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">open. And try not to shoot each other."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We fix bayonets now, Lieutenant, sir?"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Hannigan asked.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You keep your eyes open, Sergeant,"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Terrence snapped, "I'll tell you when to fix</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">bayonets."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The noisy rustling of his men's heavy</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">bodies as they pushed through the grass</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">made him nervous and irritable. Then sud-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">denly, just as they were edging their way</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">around a gully, a dozen Rumi were swarm-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing down on them. Terrence cut down two</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">with his carbine but his men were firing</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and missing as the incredibly fast catmen</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hurtled at them. He had a brief glimpse of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">O'Shaughnessy spraying submachine gun</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">slugs wildly about and then there was a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hail of spring bolts and two of his men were</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">down. The whole platoon was thrashing</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">through the grass in their direction and the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Rumi were gone as quickly as they had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">come.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Come on!" Terrence shouted, breaking</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">into a run with twenty or thirty Riflemen</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">after him. A bolt grazed his cheek and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">another cut down a man to his right. He</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">emptied his carbine in the general direction</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of the Clack, Clack, Clack. Hannigan was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">roaring a primitive bull-throated chant and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">firing at everything that moved. O'Shaugh-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nessy managed to jam his gun and was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">beating frantically at it with one webbed fist.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">They burst into a clearing filled with Rumi</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and both sides blazed away at point blank</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">range. It was hard for even a Narakan to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">miss at that close range and the Rumi broke</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and ran just as Sergeant O'Toole and his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">squad came out of the grass on the other</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">side of the clearing.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Rumi, trapped, turned and dashed at</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Terrence and his men. The lieutenant drove</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his fist into one cat faced creature and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">smashed his empty gun across the head of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">another. Hannigan grappled with one of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">lithe gray-bodied things and slowly crushed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it beneath his 350 odd pounds. O'Shaugh-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nessy beat another insensible with his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">jammed Tommy gun. Several Narakans</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">were down but most of them had taken</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Rumi with them.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Terrence was knocked off his feet by a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">gray ball of fury that leaped at him wield-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing a stiletto-thin knife. He caught at the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Rumi's arm with both hands but the crea-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ture was not only fast but strong. It twisted</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">out of his grasp and slashed at him and only</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a quick sideward roll saved him. Desper-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ately he brought his fist down on his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">assailant's head.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Rumi's grip relaxed slightly and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Terrence drove his fist full into its face and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">locked his legs about its waist. The catman</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">couldn't have weighed more than a hundred</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and fifty pounds but all of it was wiry</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">strength. It clawed at him now, ripping his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">protective clothing and gashing his legs,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">meanwhile trying to get its knife into play.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">He was vaguely conscious that his men had</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">while he repeated die call a dozen or more</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">wiped his forehead with his arm, noticing</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that the heavily caked mud was beginning</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A rare breeze had sprung up and drifting</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">down it from the west came the sound of</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">stiffened.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But there's nothing over that way. What</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">was on his feet, looking off in the direction</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">from which the sounds were coming.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Terrence was aware of an increasingly</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">A N HOUR later they were hotly engaged</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">with a large force of Rumi. Rumi</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">armed for the first time with heavier</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">weapons, mortar-like guns tiiat hurled pods</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of smothering dust that caused almost</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">instant strangulation. Rumi who attacked</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">suddenly, giving them time only to drop to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the ground and set up the Bannings and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">machine guns before three hundred howling</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fiends came charging through the grass at</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">O Mara was behind a machine gun and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Fielding and Polasky each had a Banning</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">withering hail of lead and fire. The Nara-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">kans lying as flat as their huge chests would</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">allow them were firing as fast as the auto-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">matic rifles would fire. The Bannings swept</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the line of charging figures. As the beams</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">paused for a moment, the charge would take</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">on the ground. Terrence swept his machine</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">gun along in a swath behind the Bannings,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">picking off what they left. Some dozen</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">catmen made it to within ten yards of their</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Rumi were gone, withdrawing to the</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">at his men to keep them from breaking</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ranks and following them. Three Riflemen</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and O'Toole were dead and Sergeant</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In the twenty odd years that Terrans and</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">prised at Bill's information and hurried</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">toward the place where the interrogation</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was taking place. Before he got there, he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">heard a piercing cat cry which ended in a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">gurgle and when he reached the group of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Greenbacks, Hannigan was wiping his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">bayonet on the grass. He stood looking</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">down at a Rumi officer whose throat was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">neatly slit from furry ear to furry ear. Then</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fists clenched on his hips, he confronted</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">pression that they were beginning to like</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">their jobs. He turned to Bill Fielding,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Well, Bill, it looks like we came about</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A two hour's forced march with the sun</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">beating down and the sound of firing grow-</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">could have done it and only a crazy Irish-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">man would have asked them to. They came</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">up over a rise and looked down a gentle</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">slope toward die brown twisting snake that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was the Big Muddy. On its banks lay the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">broken shape of the airship and swarming</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">across a burned circle around it were Rumi,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">thousands of them. The firing had slackened</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in the last few minutes and now they could</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">see why. The Rumi were assaulting and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">were at close grips with the ring of defend-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">At his word three hundred big clumsy</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hands reached for three hundred bayonets</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There wasn't a sound out of the Rifles</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">as they started down the hill, none of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">their usual croakings and bellowings, just</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">silence and the heavy thud of their feet. The</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Rumi had seen them. Many of those in the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">92 PLANET</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">rear of the attack were swinging about to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">face them. Spring gun bolts began to whiz</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in their direction. One or two Narakans</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fell. They were closer to the struggle now,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">closer to the tightly packed Rumi and the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hand to hand struggle about the Sun Maid.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Terrence was firing, throwing lead into</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the gray-bodied mass ahead of him but his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">men were just thundering along with their</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">little black eyes fixed on their old oppres-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sors, bayonets leveled in front of them in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">approved training school method. They re-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sembled nothing so much as a regiment of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tanks hurtling at an enemy. The momentum</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of their charge carried them half way</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">through the Rumi ranks, the terrific force</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of the plunging amphibians bowling over</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the lighter catmen.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bayonets, clubbed rifle and heavy webbed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fist fought against claw, teeth and knife.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">There was almost no firing, almost no sound</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">save for the cries of the Rumi and an occa-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sional cheer from the Terrans.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Terrence emptied his Tommy gun, hurled</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it in the face of a Rumi and reached for his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">knife and automatic. A Rumi knocked him</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">off his feet with the butt end of a spring gun</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">but before he could do more, Hannigan</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stepped over his lieutenant and plunged his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">bayonet into the catman. The Irishman</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">scrambled to his feet amidst the gray furry</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">bodies, thrust his A5 into a snarling face</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and pulled the trigger. The face disappeared</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">but another took its place and he fired again.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">A Rumi with a knife grabbed at him from</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">behind and he raised his pistol again but</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the cat was already down with a bayonet</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">between his shoulders.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Greenbacks were yelling now, lifting</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">those great voices of theirs in full throated</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">bullfrog croaks. The Rumi, trapped and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">desperate, were scattering and trying to flee</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">down river. O'Mara stumbled over a barri-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cade of rocks and boxes and almost got a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Terran slug in him before he realized that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">they had cut their way th rough to the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">broken ship. He was up in a minute and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">urging his men on after the scattering</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">enemy. Twenty or thirty of them tried to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">make a stand around a tall Rumi officer but</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">O'Shaughnessy at the head of a wedge of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Narakans swept into them at a full run.</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Their bayonets flashed for a few seconds</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and then flashed no more, the steel was</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">made it to the river under a hail of lire from</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">O'Shea and his squad on the hill. Hardly</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pausing to consider their cat-like aversion</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to water, most of them plunged in and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">struck out for the other shore. The rest were</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cut down on the bank by onrus-hing Green-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">backs. Terrence grabbed hold of one of his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">buglers and then had t® practically beat the</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bill Fielding picked his way among the</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was a blowing of sergeant's</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">whistles, the shouting of corporals, and the</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">were missing and others were limping and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">holding WGunds but they stepped out</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">smartly as the column headed back up the</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">every man was in step as they marched</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">through the makeshift barricade and past</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fanatic Tribesmen might easily have expunged the lone</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they bequeathed to him Bisha . . . Bisha--the</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unwanted; Bisha--the unnatural.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">IT WAS dose on midnight. Both moons</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">were out of the sky, and there was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">only blackness below and the mighty</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">blaze of stars above, and between them the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">old wind dragging its feet in the dust. The</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Quonset stood by itself, a half mile or so</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">from the canal bank and the town that was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">on it. Fraser looked at it, thinking what an</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">alien intrusion both it and he were in this</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">place, and wondering if he could stick out</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the four and a half months still required of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The town slept. There was no help for</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him there. An official order had been given,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and so he was tolerated. But he was not</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">welcome. Except in the big trading cities,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Earlhmen were unwelcome almost any-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">where on Mars. It was a lonesome deal.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fraser began to walk again. He walked a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">lot at night. The days were ugly and de-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pressing and he spent them inside, work-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing. But the nights were glorious. Not even</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the driest desert of Earth could produce a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sky like this, where the thin air hardly</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dimmed the lustre of the stars. It was the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">one thing he would miss when he went</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">home.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He walked, dressed warmly against the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">bitter chill. He brooded' and he watched</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the stars. He thought about his diminishing</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">whiskey supply and the one hundred and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">forty-six centuries of written history gone</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">into the dust that blew and tortured his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sinuses, and after a while he saw the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">shadow, the dark shape that moved against</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the wind, silent, purposeful, and swift.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Out of the northern desert someone was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">riding.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">For the space of three heartbeats Fraser</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stood rigid and frozen, squinting through</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the darkness and the starshine at that mov-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">94</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing shape. Then he turned and ran for the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Quonset. He was not allowed to possess a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">weapon, and if some of the fanatic northern</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tribesmen had decided to come and cleanse</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">their desert of his defiling presence, there</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was little he could do but bar the door</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and pray.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He did not go inside, just yet. It was un-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">wise to show fear until you had to. He</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stood by the open door, outside the stream</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of light that poured from it. He waited,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tensed for that final leap.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was only a single rider, mounted</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">on one of the big scaly beasts the Martian</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nomads use as the Earthly desert-folk use</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">camels. Fraser relaxed a little, but not too</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">much. One man with a spear could be</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">enough. The stranger came slowly into the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">light, wrapped and muffled against the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">night, curbing with a strong hand the un-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">easy hissings and shyings of the beast at the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">unfamiliar smells that came to it from the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Quonset. Fraser leaned forward, and sud-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">denly the weakness of relief came over him.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">The rider was a woman, and she carried</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">before her on the saddle pad a child, almost</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hidden in the folds of her cloak.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fraser gave her the courteous Martian</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">greeting. She looked down at him. tall and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fierce-eyed, hating and yet somehow desper-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ate, and presently she said, "You are the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Earthman, the doctor."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The child slept, its head lolled back</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">against the woman's body. There was some-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">thing unnatural in the way it slept, undis-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">turbed by the light or the voices. Fraser</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">said gently, "I am here only to help."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The woman's arm tightened around the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">child. She looked at Fraser, and then in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">through the open door at the unfamiliar</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Of*</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">%</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">alien things that were there. Her face, made</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">grim and hard by hunger and long marches,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and far too proud for weeping, crumpled</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">suddenly toward tears. She lifted the bridle-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">chain and swung the beast around, but be-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fore he had gone his own length she curbed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him again. When she had turned once more</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">toward Fraser she was calm as stone.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"My child is--ill," she said, very cjuielly,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hesitating over that one word.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fraser held up his arms. "I'll see what</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">I can do."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The child--a girl. Fraser saw now, per-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">haps seven years old--did not stir even</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">when she was lifted down from the saddle</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pad. Fraser started to carry her inside, say-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing over his shoulder to the woman, "I'll</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">need to ask some questions. You can watch</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">while I examine--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A wild harsh cry and a thunder of padded</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hoofs drowned out his words. He whirled</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">around, and then he ran a little way, shout-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing, with the child in his arms, but it was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">no use. The woman was bent low in the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">saddle, urging the beast on with that frantic</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cry, digging in the spurs, and in a minute</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">she was gone, back into the desert and the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">night. Fraser stood staring after her open-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mouthed, and swearing, and looking help-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">lessly at the girl. There was an ominous</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">finality about the way the woman had left.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Why? Even if the child was dying, wouldn't</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a mother wait to know? Even if the sickness</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was contagious, would she ride the Lord</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">knew how many miles across the desert</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">with her, and then run?</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">THERE were no answers to those ques-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tions. Fraser gave up and went into</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the Quonset kicking the door shut behind</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him. Passing through his combination</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">living-quarters and office, he went into the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tiny infirmary which adjoined his equally</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">small but well-equipped lab. Neither office</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nor infirmary had had many customers. The</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Martians preferred their own methods, their</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">own healers. Fraser was not supposed any-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">way to be the local G.P. The Medical</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Foundation grant and the order of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Martian authorities permitting him to be</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">here both stated that he was engaged in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">research on certain viruses. Non-cooperation</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of the populace had not made his work any</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">easier.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He became suddenly hopeful about the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">child.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Some two hours later he put her, still</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sleeping, into the neat white bed and sat</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">down in the room outside, where he could</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">watch her through the open door. He had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a drink, and then another, and lighted a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cigarette with hands that had trouble putting</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">flame and tip together.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She was sound as a dollar. Thin, a bit</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">undersized and undernourished like most</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Martian youngsters, but healthy. There was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nothing whatever the matter with her, ex-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cept that someone had thoroughly drugged</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">her.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fraser rose and flung open the outer</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">door. He went out, staring with a kind of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">desperation into the north, straining his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ears for a sound of hoofs. Dawn was not</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">far off. The wind was rising, thickening</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the lower air with dust, dimming the stars.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Out on die desert nothing moved, nor was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">there any sound.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">For the rest of that night and most of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the morning that came after it, Fraser sat</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">unmoving by the child's bed, waiting for</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">her to wake.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She did it quietly. One moment her face</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was as it had been, remote and secret, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in the next she had opened her eyes. Her</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">small body stirred and stretched, she</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">yawned, and then she looked at Fraser, very</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">solemnly but without surprise. He smiled</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and said, "Hello."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She sat up, a dark -and shaggy-haired</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">young person, with eyes the color of topaz,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and the customary look of premature age</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and wisdom that the children of Mars share</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">with the children of the Earthly East. She</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">asked hesitantly, "My mother--?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"She had to go away for a while," Fraser</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">said, and added with false assurance, "but</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">shell be back soon.' He was comforting</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">himself as much as the child.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She took even diat shred of hope from</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him. "No," she said. "She will not come</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">back." She laid her head between her knees</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and began to cry, not making any fuss</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">about it. Fraser put his arm around her.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Here," he said. "Here now, don't do</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that. Of course she'll come back for you,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">she's your mother."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"She can't."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But why? Why did she bring you here?</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">MARS MINUS BISHA 97</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">You're not sick, you don't need a doctor."</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">The child said simply, "They were going</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to kill me,"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fraser was silent for a long time. Then</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he said, "IVba?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The thin shoulders quivered under his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">arm. "They said I made the sickness that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was in our tribe. The Old Men came, all</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">together, and they told my father and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mother I had to be killed. The Old Men are</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">very powerful in magic, but they said they</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">could not make me clean." She broke off,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">choking over a sob. "My mother said it was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">her right to do the thing, and she took me</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">way off into the desert. She cried. She never</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">did that before. I was frightened, and then</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">she told me she wasn't going to hurt me,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">she was going to take me where I would</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">be safe. She gave me some bitter w'ater to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">drink, and told me not to be afraid. She</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">talked to me until I went to sleep."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She looked up at Fraser, a frightened and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">bewildered little girl, and yet with a dignity</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">about her, too.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"My mother said our gods have cursed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">me, and I would never be safe with my own</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">people any more. But she said Earthmen</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">have different gods, who wouldn't know me.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">She said you wouldn't kill me. Is that true?"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Fraser said something under his breath,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and then he told her, "Yes. That's true.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Your mother is a wise woman. She brought</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">you to the right place." His face had become</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">perfectly white. He stepped back from the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">bed and asked, "What s your name?"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Bisha."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Are you hungry, Bisha?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She hesitated, still gulping down sobs.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">I don't know."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You think about it Your clothes are</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">there--put them on. I'll fix some break-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fast"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He went out into the next room, sick and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">shaking with a rage such as he had never</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">experienced before. Superstition, ignorance,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the pious cruelty of the savage. Get an</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">epidemic going, and when the magic of the</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">child accursed, and send its own mother</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">out to slaughter it. Mentally, Fraser bowed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to the fierce-eyed woman who had been too</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tough for those cowardly old men. Poor</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">Bisha, close behind him. "Our gods, I</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">for her, with one thick garment to pull over</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">her head, and sandals for her feet. Her</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hair hung over her face and the tears still</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dripped, and now her nose was running,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and Fraser didn't know whether to laugh or</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cry. "They didn't," he said, and picked her</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">up. "It's only superstitious nonsense---"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He stopped. That was not going to do.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Seven years, a lifetime of training and be-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">lief, were not going to be wiped out by a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">few words from a stranger. He stood scowl-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing, trying hard to think of a way to reach</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">her, and then he became aware that she was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">looking at him with a child's intense and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">wondering stare, sitting quite stiffly in his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">arms. He asked, "Are you afraid of me?"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"I---I've never seen anyone like you be-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fore."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Hm. And you've never seen a house</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">like this one, either."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She glanced around, and shook her head.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"No. It's--" She had no words for what</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it was, only a shiver of awe.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fraser smiled. "Bisha, you told me the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Old Men of your tribe were very powerful</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in magic."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, yes!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He set her down and took her hand firmly</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in his. "I'm going to show you a few things.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Come on."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He didn't know whether child psycholo-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">gists and other ethical persons would ap-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">prove of his method, but it was the only</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">one he could think of. With the imposing</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">air of one performing wonders, he intro-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">duced the child of the nomad tents to the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">miracles of modern gadgetry, from running</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">water to recorded music and micro-books.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">As a climax, he permitted her to peer in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">through the door of the laboratory, at the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mystic and glittering tangle of glass and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">chrome. And he asked her, "Are your Old</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Men greater in magic than I?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'No." She had drawn away from him,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">her hands clutched tightly around her as</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">though to avoid the accident of touching</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">anything. Behind her from the living quar-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ters Wagner's Fire Music still roared and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">98</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">rippled, out of a tiny spool of wire. Sud-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">denly Bisha was down on her knees in an</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">attitude of complete submission. "You are</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the greatest doctor in the world."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Her word for "doctor" meant the same</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">as "shaman." Fraser felt contrite and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ashamed. It seemed a shabby trick to impress</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a child. But he stuck to it, saying solemnly,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Very well, Bisha. And now that that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">is understood, I tell you that curses have no</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">power in this place, and I want no more</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">talk of them."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She listened, not raising her head.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You are safe here. You are not to be</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">afraid. Look up at me, Bisha. Do you prom-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ise not to be afraid?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She looked up. He smiled, and after a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">little she smiled back. "I promise."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Good," he said, and held out his hand.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Let's eat."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ABOUT then it dawned on Fraser that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he was saddled with a child. For the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">four and a half months that remained of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his term here he would have to feed, look</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">after her and keep her hidden. The people</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of the town would hardly shelter her--</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Bisha's mother hadn't trusted them, cer-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tainly--and if they did, the nomads would</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">only find her again when they came in for</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the fall trading. The only other alternative</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was the central government at Karappa,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">which would surely not condone ritual mur-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">der, but that was three hundred miles away.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">He had a trac-car, but the work going for-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ward in the lab would not wait for him to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">trundle a slow six hundred miles up and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">down the desert. He could not possibly</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">leave it.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Four and a half months. He looked down</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">at the small figure pattering beside him,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and wondered what in the devil he was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">going to do with her all that time.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">At the end of a week he would have</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">been lost without her. The awful loneliness</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and isolation of the Quonset was gone.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">There was another voice in the place, an-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">other presence, somebody to sit across the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">table from him, somebody to talk to. Bisha</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was no trouble. She had been brought up</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">not to be a trouble, in a hard school where</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">survival was the supreme lesson, and that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">same school had impressed on her young</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mind the wisdom of making the best of</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">things. She was no trouble at all. She was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">company, the first he had had in nearly nine</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">months. He liked her.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mostly she was cheerful and alert, too</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">much engrossed in a new world of marvels</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to brood about the past. But she had her</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">moods. Fraser found her one afternoon</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">huddled in a corner, dull and spiritless, in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the depths of a depression that seemed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">almost too deep for tears. He thought he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">knew what the trouble was. He took her</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">on his lap and said, "Are you lonesome,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Bisha?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She whispered, "Yes."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He tried to talk to her. It was like talk-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing to a blank wall. At last he said helpless-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ly, "Try not to miss them too much, Bisha.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">I know I'm not the same as your own</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">family, and this place is strange to you, but</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tr7;"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You're good," she murmured. "I like</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">you. It isn't that. I was lonesome before,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sometimes."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Lonesome for what, Bisha?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I don't know. Just--lonesome."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Queer little tyke, thought Fraser, but</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">then most kids are queer to adult eyes,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">full of emotions so new and untried that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">they don't know quite how to come out.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">And no wonder she's depressed. In her</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">spot, who wouldn't be?</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He put her to bed early, and then, feel-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing unusually tired after a long day's work,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he turned in himself.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He was awakened by Bisha, shaking him,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sobbing, calling his name. Leaden and half</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dazed, he started up in alarm, asking her</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">what was the matter, and she whimpered,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"I was afraid. You didn't wake up."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What do you mean, I didn't wake up?"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">He sank back again, weighted down with</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the sleep he had not finished, and began</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to bawl her out. Then he happened to look</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">at the clock.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He had slept a trifle over fourteen hours.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Mechanically he patted Bisha and begged</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">her pardon. He tried to think, and his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">brain was wrapped in layers of cotton wool,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dull, lethargic. He had had one drink before</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">going to bed, not enough to put anyone out</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">for one hour, let alone fourteen. He had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">not done anything physically exhausting.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">He had been tired, but nothing the usual</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">eight hours wouldn't cure. Something was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">MARS MINUS BISHA</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">99</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">wron£, and a small pinpoint of fear began</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to prick him.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He asked, ''How long have you been</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">trying to wake me?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She pointed to a chair that stood beside</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the window. "When I began, its shadow</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was there. Now it is there."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As near as he could figure, about two</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hours. Not sleep, then. Semi-coma. The</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pinprick became a knife blade.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bisha said, so low that he could hardly</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hear her, "It is the sickness that was in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">our tribe. I have brought it to you."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You might have, at that," Fraser mut-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tered. He had begun to shiver, from the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">onset of simple panic. He was so far away</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">from help. It would be so easy to die here,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">walled in by the endless miles of desert</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">The child had withdrawn herself from</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him. "You see," she said, "the curse has</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">followed me."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">With an effort, Fraser got hold of him-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">self. "It hasn't anything to do with curses.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">There arc people we call carriers-- Listen,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Bisha, you've got to help me. This sickness</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">--did any of your tribesmen die of it?"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"No--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fraser trembled even more violently, this</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">time from sheer relief. "Well, then, it's</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">not so bad, is it? How does it--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The Old Men said they would die</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">unless I was taken away and kiiled." She</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had retreated even farther now, to the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">other side of the room, to the door. Sud-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">denly she turned and ran.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was a minute before Fraser's numbed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">brain understood. Then he staggered up and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">followed her, out into the dust and the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cold light, shouting her name. He saw her,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a tiny figure running between the blue-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">black sky and the dull red desolation, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he ran too, fighting the weakness and the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">lassitude that were on him. He seemed to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">run for hours with the chill wind and the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dust, and then he overtook her. She strug-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">gled, begging to be let go, and he smacked</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">her. After that she was quiet. He picked</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">her up, and she wailed, "I don't want you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to die!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fraser looked out across the pitiless desert</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and held her tight. "Do you love me that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">much, Bisha?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I have eaten your bread, and your roof</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">has sheltered me--■** T*he old ceremonial</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">phrases learned from her elders sounded</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">odd in her young mouth, but perfectly sin-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cere. "You are my family now, my mother</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and my father. I don't want my curse to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fall on you."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">For a moment Fraser found it hard to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">speak. Then he said gently, "Bisha, is your</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">wisdom greater than mine?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She shook her head.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Is it your right to question it?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What is your right, Bisha, as a child?**</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"To obey."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"You are never to do this again. Never,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">no matter what happens, are you to run</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">away from me. Do you hear me, Bisha?"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">She looked up at him. "You're not afraid</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of the curse, even now?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Not now, or any other time.1*</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You want me to stay?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Of course I do, you poor wretched little</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">idiot!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She smiled, gravely, with the queer</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dignity he had seen in her before. "You</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">are a very great doctor," she said. "You</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">will find a way to lift the curse. I'm not</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">afraid, now."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">SHE lay warm and light in the circle of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his arms, and he carried her back to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the Quonset, walking slowly, talking all</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the way. It was odd talk, in that time and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">place. It was about a far-off city called San</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Francisco, and a white house on a cliff</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that looked out over a great bay of blue</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">water. It was about trees and birds and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fishes and green hills, and all the things a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">little girl could do among them and be</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">happy. In the past few minutes Fraser had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">forgotten Karappa and the authorities of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Mars. In the past few minutes he had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">acquired a family.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Back in the lab Fraser began work. He</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">questioned Bisha about the sickness as she</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had seen it in her tribe. Apparently the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">seizures came at irregular intervals and in-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">volved nothing more than the comatose</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sleep, but he gathered that the periods of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">unconsciousness had been much shorter,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">often no more than a few minutes. That</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">could be accounted for by acquired resist-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ance on the part of the Martians. Bisha, of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">course, had never had the sickness, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Fraser imagined that the accident of natural</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">100</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">immunity had caused her to be picked for</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the tribal scapegoat.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">His own symptoms were puzzling. No</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">temperature, no pain, no physical derange-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment, only the lassitude and weakness, and</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by next morning they had passed off. He</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">consulted his books on Martian pathology.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was nothing in them. He ran a series</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of exhaustive tests, even to a spinal tap on</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bisha, which she took to be a very potent</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ritual of exorcism. He would rather have</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">done one on himself, but that was impos-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sible, and there might be evidence in the</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">child of some latent organism.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The test was negative. All the tests were</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">negative. He and Bisha both were as healthy</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as horses.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Baffled but intensely relieved, Fraser be-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gan to think of other explanations for the</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ailment. It was not a disease, so it must be</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a side-etfect of some physical condition,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">perhaps the light gravitation or pressure, or</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the thin atmosphere, or all three, that</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">affected Martians as well as Earthmen, but</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in a lesser degree. He made a detailed</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">report, thrusting into the back of his mind</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as a small worry that no such side-effect</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had ever been observed before.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He waited nervously for a recurrence. It</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">didn t come, and as the work in the lab</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">demanded more and more of his attention</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he began to forget about it. The time that</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he woke up in his chair with an untasted</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drink beside him and no memory of having</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gone to sleep he put down resolutely to</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weariness and overwork. Bisha had retired</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with another fit of the blues, so she knew</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nothing about that, and he didn't mention</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it. She seemed to be getting over the curse</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fixation, and he wanted to keep it that way.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">More time went by. Bisha was learning</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">English, and she could name all the trees</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that stood around that house in San Fran-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cisco. The confinement in the small hut</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was getting them both down, and she was</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as anxious to leave as Fraser, but apart</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from that everything was going well.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And then the nomads came in from the</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">desert for the fall trading.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fraser barred the doors and drew the</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blinds. For the three days and nights of the</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trading he and Bisha hid inside, with the</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">distant sound of the pipes and the shouting</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">coming to them muffled but poignant, the</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">music and the voices of Bisha's own people,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her own family among the tribes. They</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were hard days. At the end of them Bisha</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">retired again into the remoteness of her</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">private grief, and Fraser let her alone. On</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the fourth morning the nomads were gone.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fraser thanked whatever gods there were.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Weary and dragged out, he went into the</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lab, hating the work now because it took</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so much out of him, anxious to have it</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">finished. He started across the room to</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">open the blind--</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He was lying on the floor. The lights</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were on and it was night. Bisha was beside</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him. She seemed to have been there a long</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time. His arm ached. There were clumsy</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wrappings on it, stained with blood. Shards</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of glass littered the end of the lab bench</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the floor. The familiar leaden numb-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ness pervaded his whole body. It was hard</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to move, hard to think. Bisha crept to him</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and laid her head on his chest, silently, like</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a dog.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Very slowly Fraser's head cleared, and</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thoughts came into it. 7 must have fallen</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">across the bench. Good God, what if I had</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">broken the virus cultures? Not only us, the</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whole town-- I might have bled to death,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ami what would happen to Bisha? Suppose</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I did die, what would happen to her?</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It took longer this time to return to</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">normal. He stitched up the cuts in his arm,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the job was not neat. He was afraid.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He was afraid to leave his chair, afraid to</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">smoke, afraid to operate the stove. The</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hours crawled by, the rest of the night, an-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other day, another evening. He felt better,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but fear had grown into desperation. He</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had only Bisha's word that this illness was</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not fatal. He began to distrust his own</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tests, postulating alien organisms unrecog-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nizable to the medical science he knew.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He was afraid for himself. He was terrified</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for Bisha.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He said abruptly, "I am going into the</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">town."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then I will come with you."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No. You'll stay right here. I'll be all</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">right. There is a doctor in the town, a</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Martian healer. He may know--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fie went out, into the bitter darkness and</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tie blazing of the stars. It seemed a lone</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">way to the town.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He passed the irrigated land, stripped</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">MARS MINUS BISHA</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">101</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of its harvest, and came into the narrow</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">streets. The town was not old as they go</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on Mars, but the mud brick of the walls</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had been patched and patched again, fight-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing a losing battle with the dry wind and</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the scouring dust. There were few people</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">abroad. They looked at Fraser and passed</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him by, swarthy folk, hot-eyed and per-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">petually desperate. The canal was their god,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their mother and their father, their child</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and their wife. Out of its dark channel they</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drew life, painfully, drop by drop. They</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">did not remember who had cut it, all the</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long miles from the polar cap across the</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dead sea-bottoms, across the deserts and</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through the tunnels underneath the hills.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They only knew that it was there, and that</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it was better for a man to sin the foulest</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sin than to neglect the duty that was on him</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to keep the channel clear. A cruel life, and</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yet they lived it, and were content.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There were no torches to light the streets,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">but Fraser knew the house he wanted. The</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">door of corroded metal opened reluctantly</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to his knock and closed swiftly behind him.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">The room was small, lit by a smoky lamp</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and barely warmed by a fire of roots, but</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">on the walls there were tapestries of incal-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">culable age and incredible value.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">TOR-ESH, the man of healing, did well</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">at his trade. His robe was threadbare,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">but his belly protruded and his chops were</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">plump, unusual things among his lean</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">people. He was fetish-priest, oracle, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">physician, and he was the only man of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">town who had shown any interest in Fraser</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and his work. It was not necessarily a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">friendly interest. He gave Fraser the tradi-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tional greeting, and Fraser said stiffly,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I need your help. I have contracted an</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">illness--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tor-Esh listened. His eyes were shrewd</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and penetrating, and the smile that was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">habitually on his face left them untouched.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">As Fraser talked, even that pretense of a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">smile went gradually away.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When he was finished, Tor-Esh said,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Again. More slowly, please, your Martian</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">is not always clear,"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But do you know what it is? Can you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tell me--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tor-Esh said, "Again!"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fraser repeated the things he had said,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">trying not to show the fear that was in him.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Tor-Esh asked questions. Accurate questions.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Fraser answered them. For a little bit Tor-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Esh was silent, heavy-faced and grim in the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">flickering light, and Fraser waited with his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">heart pounding in his throat.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tor-Esh said slowly, "You are not ill.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">But unless a certain tiling is done, you will</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">surely die."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fraser spoke in anger. "Talk sense! A</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">healthy man doesn't fall off his feet. A</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">healthy man doesn't die, except by acci-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dent."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"In some ways,'' said Tor-Esh very soft-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ly, "we are an ignorant people. It is not</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">because we have not learned. It is because</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">we have forgotten."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I'm sorry, I didn't mean-- Look, I came</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to you for help. This is something I don't</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">understand, something I can't cope with."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes." Tor-Esh moved to the window,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dark in the thickness of the wall. "Have</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">you thought of the canal? Not only this one,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">but the many canals that bind Mars in a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">great net. Have you thought how they must</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">have been built? The machines, the tremen-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dous power that would have been needed,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to make a dying world live yet a little</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">longer. We are the children of the men</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">who conceived and built them, and yet</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nothing is left to us but the end product</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of their work, and we must grub with our</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hands in the channel, digging out the blown</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sand."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I know," said Fraser impatiently. "I've</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">studied Martian history. But what--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Many centuries," said Tor-Esh, as</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">though he had not heard. "Nations and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">empires, wars and pestilences, and kings</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">beyond the counting. Learning. Science.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Growth and splendor, and weariness, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">decay. Oceans have rolled away into dust,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the mountains have fallen down, and the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sources of power are used up. Can you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">conceive, you who come from a young</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">world, how many races have evolved on</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Mars?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He turned to face the Earthman. "You</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">have come with your thundering ships, your</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">machines and your science, giving the lie</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to our gods, who we thought had created</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">no other men but us. You look upon us as</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">degraded and without knowledge--and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">yet you too are an ignorant people, not be-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">102</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cause you have forgotten, but because you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">have not yet learned. There are many sci-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ences, many kinds of knowledge. There</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">have been races on Mars who could build</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the canals. There were others who could see</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">without eyes and hear without ears, who</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">could control the elements and cause men</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to live or die as they willed it, who were</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">so powerful that they were stamped out</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">because men feared them. They are forgot-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ten now, but their blood is still in us. De-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">struction of a people is never complete.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">We few who are left are blended into one</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">race, but their blood is in us. And some-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">times a child is born--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fraser stiffened.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tor-Esh said quietly, "There was talk</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">among the nomads about a child."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Nerves, drawing tight in Fraser's belly.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Fear-nerves, and a chill sweat. I never men-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tioned Bisha. How could he know--</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I'm not interested in folk lore. Just tell</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">me--</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"There was a certain evil in the tribe.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">When the child was taken away, the evil</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">departed. Now it is in your house. It seems</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that the mother lied. The child is not dead.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">She is with you."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Witchcraft and sorcery," Fraser snarled.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"Curses and cowardice. I thought you knew</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">better, Tor-Esh." He started for the door.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"I was a fool to come here."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tor-Esh moved swiftly and placed his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hand on the latch, that it might not be</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">lifted until he was through.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We are ignorant folk, but still we do</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">not kill children because we find pleasure</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in it. As for witchcraft and sorcery--words</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">are words. Only facts have meaning. If you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">wish to die, that is your affair. But when</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">you are dead the child must come into the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">town--and that is our affair. I will send</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">word to the nomads. The girl is theirs, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the duty belongs to them, we do not w'ish</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it. But until they come I will set a wall</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">around your house. You are likely to die</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">quite soon. There were twenty in her tribe</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to share the curse, but you are alone, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">we can take no chances."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Seeing, perhaps, the absolute horror in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Fraser's face, Tor-Esh added, "It will be</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">done mercifully. We bear the child no</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hate."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He lifted the latch, and Fraser went into</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the narrow street. He turned toward the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">desert, and when he had crossed the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ploughed land he began to run. He ran</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fast, but a rider passed him, speeding into</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the desert on the track of the caravan.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bisha was waiting for him, sleepily anx-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ious. He said, "You know where the food</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">is. Pack as much as you can in the trac-car.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Blankets, too. Hurry up, we're leaving."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">HE WENT into the laboratory. In violent</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">haste, but with the utmost care, he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">destroyed the work of months, tempted as</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he did so to forget ethics and scatter his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">virus cultures broadcast into the town. Evil.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Superstition. Legendary warlocks, tales of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">mighty wizards. He had read some of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">old imaginative stories, written before space</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">flight, in which ruthless Earthmen were</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pictured trampling innocent Mars under</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">their feet. Logic and logistics both had made</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that impossible, when it came to the un-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">romantic reality, and he was almost sorry. He</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">would have liked to trample some Martians</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">under his feet.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When the laboratory was cleansed, he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">threw his notes together in a steel box and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">took them into the dust-tight shed at the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">back of the Quonset where the trac-car was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">housed. Bisha, tear-streaked and silent, had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">been patiently lugging supplies. He checked</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">them rapidly, added a few more, and swung</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the child up into the cab. She looked at</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him, and he realized then that she was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">frightened. "Don't worry," he told her.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"We're going to be all right."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You're not taking me back?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He said savagely, "I'm taking you to the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Terran consulate at Karappa, and after that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">I'm taking you to San Francisco. And no-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">body had better try to stop me."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He flung open the shed door and climbed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in beside her. The trac-car rolled out clank-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ing across the sand. And already there were</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">lines of torches, streaming out from the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">town, flung across his way.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He said, "Crouch down on the floor,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Bisha, and stay there. You won't get hurt."</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">He poured on the power. The trac-car</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">lurched forward, snorting and raising a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">great cloud of dust. He headed it straight</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">for the wavering line of torches, ducking</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">his head instinctively so that he was pressed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">close to the wheel. The cab was metal, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">MARS MINUS BISHA 103</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the glass parts of it were theoretically un-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">breakable, but he could see now in the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">torchlight the bright metal throwing-sticks</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of the townsmen, the swift boomerangs that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">could take off a man's head as neatly as a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">knife blade. He ducked.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Something hit the window beside him,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">starring it with a million cracks. Other</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">things whacked and rattled viciously against</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the car. The torches fell away from in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">front of him, taking with them the dark</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">startled faces of the men who held them.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">He was through the line. The open desert</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was before him. Three hundred miles,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Karappa, and civilization.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">If he could beat the nomads.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He had better beat them. It was his neck</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">as well as Bisha's. He needed care. He</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">needed it fast, from somebody who did not</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">believe in curses.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dawn came, cold in a dark sky, veiled</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in dust. There was no canal between them</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and Karappa, no town, nothing but the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fine dry sand that flowed like water under</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the wind.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">' Look here," he said to Bisha. "If I</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">should suddenly fall asleep--" He showed</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">her how to stop the trac-car. ''At once,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Bisha. And stay inside the cab until I wake</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">again." She nodded, her lips pressed tight</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">with the effort of concentration. He made</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">her do it several times until he was sure</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">she would not forget.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The miles flowed out before and behind,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to left and to right, featureless, unbroken.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">How long would it take a single rider to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">catch a laden caravan? How long for the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">desert men on their fleet beasts to find a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">trail? The sand was soft and the clanking</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">treads sank in it, and no matter how much</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">you wanted to hurry you could go no faster</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">than the desert would let you.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bisha had been thinking hard. Suddenly</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">she said, "They will follow us."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She was smart, too smart for her own</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">good. Fraser said, "The nomads? We can</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">beat them. Anyway, they'll soon give up."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No, they'll follow. Not you, but me.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">And they will kill us both."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fraser said, "We're going to Eardi. The</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">men of Mars, and the gods of Mars, can't</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">reach there."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"They are very powerful gods-- Are you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sure?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Very sure. You'll be happy on Earth,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Bisha."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She sat close to him, and after a while</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">she slept. There was a compass on the dash,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a necessity in that place of no roads and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">no landmarks. Fraser kept the needle cen-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tered, setting a course as though with a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ship. I ime and the sand rolled on, and he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">was tired.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tired.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You are likely to die quite soon--there</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">were twenty in her tribe to share the curse--</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">rjlHE desert whispered. The sounds of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">-L the trac-car were accepted and forgotten</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">by the ear, and beyond them the desert</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">whispered, gliding, sliding, rippling under</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the wind. Fraser's vision blurred and wa-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">vered. He should not have pushed himself</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">so hard at the work. Tired, no resistance</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to the sickness. That was why it had been</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">light among the hardy nomads, more serious</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in him, an alien already worn down by</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">months of confinement and mental strain.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">That was why.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--twenty in her tribe to share it--but</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">you, alone--</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Three hundred miles isn't so far. Of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">course you can make it. You've made it in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">an afternoon, on Earth.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">This isn't Earth. And you didn't make</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it in a cold creeping desert.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You, alone--</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Damn Tor-Esh!</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Bisha, wake up. We need some food.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">And first off, I need that bottle."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">With a drink and some food inside him</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he felt better. "We'll keep on all night.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">By morning, easy, we'll be in Karappa. If</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the nomads are following, they'll never</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">catch up."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mid-afternoon, and he was driving in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a daze. He lost track of the compass. When</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he noticed it again he was miles off his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">course. He sat for some minutes trying to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">remember the correct reading, trembling.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Bisha watched him.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Don't look so frightened," he said. His</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">voice rose. "I'm all right. I'll get us there!"</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">She hung her head and looked away from</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">him.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And don't cry, damn it! Do you hear?</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">I've got enough on my neck without you</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">being doleful."</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">104</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">PLANET 8 f OKIES</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It is because of me," she said. "You</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">should have believed the words of the Old</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Men."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He struck her, the first time he had ever</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">laid his hand on her in anger. "I don't want</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">any more of that talk. If you haven't learned</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">better in all this time--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She retreated to the other side of the</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seat. He got the trac-car going again, in</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the right direction, but he did not go far.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He had to rest. Just an hour's sleep would</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">help. He stopped. He looked at Bisha, and</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like something that had happened years ago</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he remembered that he had slapped her.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">''Poor little Bisha," he said, "and it isn't</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">any of it your fault. Will you forgive me?"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She nodded, and he kissed her, and she</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cried a little, and then he went to sleep,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">telling her to wake him when the hand on</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the dashboard clock reached five. It was</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hard to rouse when the time came, and</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it was full dark before the trac-car was</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lurching and bucking its way out of the</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sand that had drifted around it. Fraser</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was not refreshed. He felt worse, if any-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing, sapped and drained, his brain as</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">empty as an upturned bucket.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He drove.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He was off his course again. He must</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">have dozed, and the car had made a circle</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to the south. He turned angrily to Bisha and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">said, "Why didn't you stop the car? I told</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">you--"</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In the faint glow from the dashboard</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he saw her face, turned toward the desert,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and he knew the look on it, the withdrawal</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and the sadness. She did not answer. Fraser</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">swore. Of all the times to pick for a fit of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the blues, when he needed her so badly!</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">She had enough to make her moody, but</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it was getting to be a habit, and she had no</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">right to indulge her emotions now. She</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had already cost them precious hours, pre-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cious miles. He reached out and shook her.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was like shaking a rag doll. He spoke</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to her sharply. She seemed not to hear.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Finally he stopped the car, furious with her</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stubbornness, and wrenched her around to</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">face him. For the second time he slapped</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She did not weep. She only whispered,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"I can't help it. They used to punish me</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">*00, but I can't help it."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She didn't seem to care. He couldn't</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">touch her, couldn't penetrate. He had never</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tried to shake her out of these moods before.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Now he found that lie could not. He let</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her sink back into the corner, and he</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">looked at her, and a slow corrosive terror</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">began to creep through him because of</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the times before--the times that she had</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been like this.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The times immediately preceding the</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">periods of blackness, the abnormal sleep.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A pattern. Every time, the same unvaried</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pattern.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But it made no sense. It was only coin-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cidence.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Coincidence, three times repeated? And</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">how had Tor-Esh known so certainly that</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the child was with him?</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Three times, the pattern. If it happened</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a fourth time, it could not be coincidence.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">If it happened a fourth time, he would</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">know7.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Could he afford a fourth time?</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Crazy. How could a child's moods affect</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a man?</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He grabbed her again. A desperation</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came over him. He treated her roughly,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more roughly than he could ever have</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dreamed of treating a child. And it did no</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">good. She looked at him with remote eyes</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and bore it without protest, without inter-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">est.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Not a mood, then. Something else.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">What?</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Sometimes a child is born--</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">again from outside, because its own regen-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was draining his now. There had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">been twenty in her tribe, and so none of</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">And that was why the intervals had short-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He stopped the car and looked at her.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">She was so little and helpless, and he had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">come to love her. It wasn't her fault. Some-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He didn't know. But she had run away</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">and a great silence. As one creeping back</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">from the edge of an abyss he woke, and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the car was very still. There was no one</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in it with him. He called, but there was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">no answer.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He got out of the car. He walked, call-</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">of the nomads' beasts, coming toward the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">car from behind. The small tracks of Bisha's</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">feet, going back to meet them.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He stopped calling. The sound of his</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">voice was too loud, too terrible. He began</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to run, back along that trail. It ended in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a little huddle of clothing that had no life</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in it.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She had broken her promise to him. She</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">haywire in the fuel system of his Interstar</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Runabout. He was losing altitude fast, so</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">climatic conditions of the third planet were</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deadly to a Mercurian. He thought once of</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">donning his space suit but decided against</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">From Planet Three, when one has a smashed</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Probos Five ceased to manipulate the un-</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Probos Five thought fleetingly of his wife</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a good wife and mother in addition to being</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">on the first planet from the sun. Ah, that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">is the place to live, thought Probos, the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">temperature an unchanging 327°; just com-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fortably warm, where one could enjoy a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">life of warmth and ease. Too bad that he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">would not live to see it again. Thirty vargs,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he reflected is such a short time. With luck,*</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">perhaps he may have lived to see a hundred</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">vargs slip by. And perhaps in time he may</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">have added three more heads and five dergs</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in length to his towering trunk.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">material for her committees.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He wished that Lingua Four would settle</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">down and be content as a housewife, but he</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">doubted that she would. Social ambition was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">boring like a termite under her bark.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Lingua Four was determined to be the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">first lady of Arbor, the capital city of Mer-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cury. To this end Lingua Four had labored</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">unceasingly. She was president of half the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">women's clubs of Arbor. She could always</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">be depended upon to furnish the best in new</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and diverting subjects.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She headed almost all committees for aid</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">or research on any type of problem. It was</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">owing to Lingua Four being president of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the Committee for Undernourished Arbor-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ians that Probos Five was making this ill-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">starred trip. His purpose was to capture a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">few of the upright, divided trunk animals</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that inhabited the third planet.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They were to be transported to Mercury</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and given over to scientific study as to their</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">edible qualities. If it were found that the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">divided trunk creatures were fit for Mercu-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">rian consumption, the problem of under-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">nourishment would no longer exist since the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">supply of divided trunks was seemingly in-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">exhaustible. Mercurians had made expedi-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tions to the third planet before and every</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">report concluded with -- "Divided trunk</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">creatures increasing in number."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Privately Probos Five doubted the pos-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sibility of using the divided trunks for food</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">since the last expedition once again reported</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a complete lack of captives due to the frail</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and tenuous bodies of the divided trunks.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Then too, transportation and preservation</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">opposed a tremendous problem, not to men-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tion the difficulty of trying to eat something</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that might vaporize on your fork. But then</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">these questions may never arise, he decided,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">for of all the reports perused by Probos</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Five not one expedition had succeeded in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">bringing a divided trunk to Mercury.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">All reports were read to the last letter by</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Probos Five before assembling equipment</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">for his own trip. In the reports he had noted</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">many of the difficulties of the earlier mis-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sions. Planet Three was impossible for a</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Mercurian without a heated space suit. The</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">temperature of Planet Three was so low that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">it would literally freeze a Mercurian stiff in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a matter of seconds.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The casualties of the early expeditions</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">had been numerous. Many Mercurians had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">succumbed to the bitter cold due to flaws</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in space suits and other accidents. A break</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in the suit meant instant death. The victims</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of such mishaps were invariably buried in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the isolated, sparsely inhabited Polar regions</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to avoid alarming the divided trunk crea-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tures.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was strange, mused Probos Five, that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the divided trunks were seemingly unable</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to bear the slightest increase in tempera-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ture. Their bodies disintegrated upon con-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tact with a Mercurian. Some were roped and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">dragged from a distance up to the doors of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the space ships, but no inhabitant of Planet</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Three had been closer to Mercury than the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">air lock of the space cruisers. As the divided</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">trunk people were dragged into the air lock,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">warm air from the ship would be pumped</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">into the lock to dispel the frigid air of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Planet Three. As the warmth of Mercury</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">enveloped the divided trunks they became</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">quite red, began to melt and finally dis-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">solved into a gaseous state, leaving a small</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">pile of ashes and a disagreeable odor in the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">air lock that sometimes lingered for days.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Probos Five believed he had the solution</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">for these obstacles in the path of scientific</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">study of the divided trunks. He had decided</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to use guile in place of strength. For this</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">reason he had come alone and in a small</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">space runabout to put his solution to the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">test. But his solution now could never be</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">tried, he remembered morosely.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">IN THE aft compartment Probos Five had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">constructed a refrigeration plant. By</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">maintaining a constant degree of frigidity</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">he hoped to deliver a pair of each species of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">divided trunks to Mercury. He hoped espe-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cially to capture a complete set and perhaps</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">a few over to make up for breakage and</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">losses. As to what form of sustenance the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">divided trunks were accustomed to he had</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">no idea whatsoever. He had intended to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">bring samples of earth, vegetation and any-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">thing else that may have suggested a source</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of food for the divided trunks.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The thought too had occurred to him that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">108</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">possibly the divided trunk creatures ate one</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">another. On the possibility of this Probos</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Five had determined to capture three black</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ones, three white enes, three yellows, three</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">browns and three reds, and three of any</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other color that he might find. He rather</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">doubted that more colors or combina-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion of colors existed. All previous expedi-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion reports had mentioned only the five</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">colors. However, Probos Five had deter-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mined to keep several eyes open on the off</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chance that he might find a new and dif-</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ferent species.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">His refrigerator was modeled along the</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">architectural lines of the dens of the divided</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trunks. The main room of the refrigerator</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">opened to the outside of the ship by means</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of a small air lode. A Mcrcurian size air</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lock was not needed for the divided trunks,</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as few had been found to be much over</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">three dergs in height.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Winches and cables to pull the divided</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trunks into the refrigerator were installed</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the refrigerator room itself to avoid</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">burning the divided trunks with hot cables</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from other parts of the ship.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In addition, Probos Five had cunningly</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the divided trunks showed no hesitancy in</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">entering these types of dens. In fact, the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">writer of the report gave it as his opinion</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that the divided ones perhaps played games</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in these types of caves. It also mentioned</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that some of the dens were equipped with</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">flat shiny surfaces that cast reflections or</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">images. Probos Five had incorporated the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">image making surfaces into his trap design.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">A pity that all this effort must be wasted</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">thought Probos as he once more turned to</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the observation ports to check his remaining</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">distance from the planet's surface. Seeing</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that his time was short Probos Five turned</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">all five faces forward in the Mercurian ges-</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">came the shock.</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A week later the proprietor of a novelty</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Seems funny when a fan realizes the different __</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">AMAZING. Or, the fan in question might buy other</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">Dear Editor:</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Waiting for a streetcar the other day, I happened</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to glance at the magazine stand situated at the car</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">stop. What I saw there caused a state of shock.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">I wasn't released from it until I had bought the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Sept. issue of PLANET Stories and stared at the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">cover for a full ten minutes. For the first time in the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">seven years I've been reading S-F, I saw IT! IT</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">meaning a girl on the cover of an S-F magazine,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">wearing a space suit in space.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Now it isn't that I'm against half-nude gals on</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">covers, but I'm a firm believer in the equality of the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sexes. If men have to wear space suits, women</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">should too. Also, I doubt tiiat anyone buys your</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">magazine for the pin-up value of its covers.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Besides, I believe I enjoy the covers much more</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">than anyone. Why? Because of a simple optical</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">device that I use. It's by removing the lenses from</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">the viewers used for 3-D movies, and replacing one</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">with a transparent piece of blue plastic, and the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">other with red plastic. Try it. When looking at a</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">picture, it gives the illusion of depth.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">However, they do not work for black and white</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">Dear Editor:</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Thursday night. I put on my trench coat, dark</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">hat, equally dark gloves and stepped out into the</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Yes, no one was about, so I quickened my pace</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">the corner and saw, like a beacon, bringing home</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">some wandering soul, the neon sign over the drug</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">store.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As I turned into the store, I pulled up my collar</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to cover my face and pulled down my hat. Then,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">picking up the September issue of PLANET, 1</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">slithered up to druggist.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Twenty-five cents," says he.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I plunked down a piece of United States currency</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">was amazed by die cover. No BEM's, no naked</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">girls out in space without space suits. (And what'«</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">more, I found out later, it illustrated the story.)</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I was almost tempted to take off my disguijc</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and let the man behind the counter recognize me.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">"But no," I said. "I'm a respectable teen ager and</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">my hands. People who criticize stf for lurid (so</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">they say) covers, should be berled in erl. But let</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">these same individuals be criticized for possession</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of a nationally known magazine with a young lady</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">wrapped in about three inches of gauze, they flip</seg>

    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Issue after issue, the VIZIGRAPH has been get-</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">admit we're growing up, even in the space-opera</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">class, and can no longer find it in us to enjoy column</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">after column of variegated trash, the only difference</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in it being that one writer had a preference for rows</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of exclamation marks or uncapitalized words.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But even in this day of renovated wordage, there</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">Still lurks one last anachronistic system--the voting</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">arrangement for deciding which letter wins an illo.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">All of us have to admit that at one time or another</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">we've had doubts as to how fairly the balloting is</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">arranged.</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">112 PLANET</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">la simple terms, the choice rests with the choice</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">few who send in letters. Sometimes even they neglect</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">to exercise their franchise, the net result being that</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">in this democratic continent a clique of ten to fifteen</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">fen who have had their letters printed (plus I don't</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">know how many fen who didn't; control the election</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">exclusively.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Another perplexing thing is that fen won't take the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">trouble to write in, wasting both money and energy,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">so that someone else can win a prize. And I don't</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">blame them. At the most they include their selection</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ia a letter of their own, becoming another member</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of the clique.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We have the problem, so how can we find a fair</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">solution? I don't know how many times I have</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">thought that the arranging of the letters has a great</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">deal to do with the choice, too. You may not have</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">any real vote, Jack, but you do have a lot of power</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">when it comes to "electioneering."</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Many readers say, "Well Jack must know the best</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">ones. That's why he puts them there." Usually the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">first three are the choicest, too, but still there are the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">odd good ones circulating around through the rest</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of LA VIZI. The back page is left for the neophytes</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">and fanatics.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">My solution to the problem is not to mix the</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">letters up, because if the editor wants to arrange</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">them in order of readability, it makes it that much</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">easier for us readers to pick out the crud. However,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">if you want the average reader to take time to vote,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">you'll have to bribe him, as it were, with the bait</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">of egoboo . . . who can resist that?</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It wouldn't hurt the VIZIGRAPH at all to have</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">* few letters deleted, and in a couple of columns,</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">give the readers' names and home cities (addresses</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">might take up too much room), and the three per-</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">sons they voted for. Excluding the letter-writers of</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">that issue of course, who have already outlined their</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">preferences.</seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg>
    </ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Readers and fen have been yelling for more</seg>

    <seg type="columnLine">it could grow into a good two columns. It would</seg>
    <seg type="columnLine">be interesting to both readers, senders, and letter-</seg>
