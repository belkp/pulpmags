Half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazed with pain in the semi-consciousness</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he was always fighting for, it was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he had passed out of the old life already</seg><seg type="columnLine">and into a fierce land of sorcery. Of only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing could he be certain now--the pair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steady black eyes watching him through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fissure in the rocks above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had it been an hour since he had called</seg><seg type="columnLine">out? Or had many circling eons reeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunkenly over him since his voice, disturb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the vast silence, had choked back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his throat? He did not know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew that he had called out, thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these were the eyes of a man, a human</seg><seg type="columnLine">being like himself, that he had begged for</seg><seg type="columnLine">help. He knew that there had come no</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer, that the eyes had watched him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the same steady curiosity. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had shouted and that long ago he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had grown still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once he had painfully dragged from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster the automatic which had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaken loose in his fall; when, with a blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger upon him, he had lifted it a little the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two eyes were gone. When it had fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his weak grasp the two eyes were back</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, watching him with the same cursed</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment of half delirium the quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion had come to him that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strang, Strang who had deserted him in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">helplessness, robbing him of the scant sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply of water to drive on madly, seeking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gain the next water-hole. But no; Strang</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be tarrying here, watching him</seg><seg type="columnLine">die. Strang wouldn't even be so much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking of him. Strang was taking his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance, his one chance, and pushing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup had lived through the day</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">praying dumbly for the coming coolness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night. Now the night was coming and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was afraid of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He twisted his head a little to look at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun. He was less sure that the sun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting than that this was the last time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would ever look upon it. In the west, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">riot of color; the sun was sinking through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist which seemed to rise from a sea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood. Night was at hand. And with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of its coming the sense was strong upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him of the unknown, terror-infested, creep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing closer about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Strang might have waited," he thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His swollen lips and dry, aching throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">were long ago past utterance.

There was much</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubbornness in Sax Northrup.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS not meant that he should</seg><seg type="columnLine">die yet. And so he did not die.

There was sufficient light for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to see clearly, but his brain cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In seeking to guess the riddle of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, to conjure up the thing to which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">belonged, he had never thought of a wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. And yet a woman it was bending</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him, though his mind took long in clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing enough for him to be sure of that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was old, unthinkably old, unbeliev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably ugly. She might have been the bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ren deity of a barren land. She might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a skeleton, with the skin upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleshless skull tanned by sun and wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">through hundreds of years until it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather. Squatting motionless over him she</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not seem to be a living, breathing being</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he saw the eyes, the same steady, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">winking black pools of ink with the glint of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon in them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Y ahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">5</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moment was uncanny. The moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light dragged weird figures from the desert</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, charging them with ghostly unreality.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thing squatting above him might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a sister thing to the fantastic shapes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon made everywhere about her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup shivered. His reason, making</seg><seg type="columnLine">its way back through the darkness of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupor, had not fully reinstated itself. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that here in this strange land of arid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity there could be no such thing as decom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">position. When death came it struck its</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow cleanly, unattended by decay. Air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, wind, when they had their way undis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">puted, made of the dead such a thing as</seg><seg type="columnLine">that which bent over him. If no prowling</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast came to rend apart, then the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">would last throughout generations, perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">centuries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fear comes in many guises but never</seg><seg type="columnLine">with so cold a clutch as when whispering</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the supernatural. At the shock from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures whipped up before him by his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">imaginings, Northrup again lost conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later--he did not know how much later</seg><seg type="columnLine">--it seemed quite natural for him to feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">that some one was moving about him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized dimly that it couldn't be Strang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Strang had gone on. He knew that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be the thousand-year-old woman who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come out of the nowhere, riding on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon-ray, perhaps; who, when she was done</seg><seg type="columnLine">pottering around him, would go back the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way she had come. He didn't try to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head to watch her because he knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hadn't the strength left in him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had slipped something soft under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders, had even managed to turn his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great body a little, making it lie a fraction</seg><seg type="columnLine">less painfully. And she had brought him</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. That was a joke on Strang! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone on furiously, lugging three or four</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm cupfuls in his canteen, thinking that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no other drop to be had until one</seg><seg type="columnLine">had crossed many miles of desert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came intervals during which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup was oblivious to everything about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, brief spaces of time when he awoke to</seg><seg type="columnLine">both realization and curiosity. But for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most part he existed in a condition which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a sort of dim border-line between con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness and stupor. He accepted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">present as matter of fact, forgot the past</seg><seg type="columnLine">and did not seek to speculate upon the fu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For days he lay upon the talus, upon the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">first of whose ragged boulders he had fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the cliffs of porphyry above. The old</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, moving with the feebleness and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowness of a Winter sunbeam, forced her</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking hands to construct a shelter over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot where he lay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A ragged, home-made cotton blanket</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched above him from rock to rock, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">robe of rabbit-skins made at once cover and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed. She brought him water in a rude olla</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sun-baked clay, administered gruelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">messes made from com-meal, attending him</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the first with a faithfulness like a shep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">herd dog's. Where she went for the water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was the source of her food supply, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The silence was seldom broken. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours at a time she would squat near him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her blanket drawn about her shoulders, over</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head, her hands lost in its folds, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient face turned upon him in an expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sionless stare. When there arose absolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">need for speech there was no difficulty in</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup, through many years of going</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down among people of her breed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to understand the tongue of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians of Walpi, Oraibe, Taos. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had called her "So Wuhti," which is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hopi for Old Woman or Grandmother, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had understood. She had named him "Ba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liana," White Man, and the ceremony of</seg><seg type="columnLine">introduction was complete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time Northrup, lying grim and</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet, thought that by struggling to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">on living he was but postponing the hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his death a few hours. Among his lesser</seg><seg type="columnLine">injuries he thought that he could count the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fracture of his left arm. He could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">speculate upon the extent of injury done</seg><seg type="columnLine">internally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had he been in a hospital with capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">physician and nurses attending him there</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be a chance. But here, with the half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooked food a wild woman brought, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nauseating decoctions which she ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted from he knew not what plants or</seg><seg type="columnLine">roots, with a bed of lava rock, his chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed little enough. He watched her mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his medicines, heating the sticky liquid</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a greasewood fire, then setting it aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she might sing over it and so make it</seg><seg type="columnLine">"good medicine," and imagined that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixture would be about as efficacious as her</seg><seg type="columnLine">singing. The latter was horrible enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he got well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And they grew to be companions of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sort, as perhaps nearly any two of God's</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures would if set alone in the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fact that the old hag was living here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and absolutely alone, that she seemed con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tented to be here and looked for no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">company than her own until Northrup had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come, aroused curiosity after a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He soon found many questions to ask.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And during the five months which passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he was a strong man again--and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be certain of his full strength before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he seeks to walk out into the desert with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little water he can carry and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge that he must travel forty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the first water-hole--he learned much</seg><seg type="columnLine">from So Wuhti.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     HAD not So Wuhti led him at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her abode, Northrup would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">have found it. It was slow climb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for them both, the woman weighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">down by close to a century of years, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man still so weak that a little exertion set</seg><seg type="columnLine">him trembling throughout his wasted body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chosen chamber of So Wuhti was</seg><seg type="columnLine">close up to the cliff-tops, a roughly gouged-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out room in the rocks, to be approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">only by a steep trail from below. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">constructed cunningly in a great fissure so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that while from it the old woman might</seg><seg type="columnLine">look out over the desert, it would be a keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye down there to discover her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon the floor lay So Wuhti's bed, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumbled pile of cotton blankets of native</seg><seg type="columnLine">weave and a rabbit-skin robe. In a smoke-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackened corner were a few charred sticks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bits of brush; here and there were sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">baked clay utensils, for the most part black</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cracked. A few strings of dried meat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a heap of shelled corn, a pot of water, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayer-stick against the wall by the bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed the equipment of the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From So Wuhti's boudoir--Northrup al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways called it that and So Wuhti seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly pleased with the name--it was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">trick to come to the top of the cliffs by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of the short ladder. And here one</seg><seg type="columnLine">came upon that wonder of the desert of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which a thousand tongues have told since</seg><seg type="columnLine">first the old Spanish conquistadores dipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it, which countless artists have sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to catch upon their brushes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a hundred miles in all directions the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye passed over gray floor, sweeping up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">loma and mesa, the magic desert colorings</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">over it all, deep blues and glittering bronzes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snow white of drifted sands, the gray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">green of cactus and brush, the brick reds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocky precipices. Through the clear, dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">air the eye sped instantly over waterless</seg><seg type="columnLine">distances where a man might find slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">death in crossing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here, just at the cliff's edge, Northrup</seg><seg type="columnLine">found again the half-expected, the tumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins of an ancient watch-tower. His mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">toyed with the pictures which his fancies</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The vision arose of a gaunt, cat-quick sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinel, hawk-eyed, skin beaten into glistening</seg><seg type="columnLine">copper from the sun, keeping guard here</seg><seg type="columnLine">while his brothers slept in a younger cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tury; starting up as, many miles away</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the rolling floor of desert sand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrubby growth he caught a quick glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an invading enemy; cupping his hands to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mouth to send outward and downward</seg><seg type="columnLine">his warning shout; kindling the ever-ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">pile of greasewood fagots to send out over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the land other messages of warning, voice-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, lightning-winged. And, as if the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">time were not yet dead though the watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower of stone was crumbling, he saw a pile</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dry greasewood and a black smudge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke against the side of the one upstand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing slab of stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went back, down to So Wuhti, won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As,little by little, strength came back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his emaciated body, he grew impatient for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time when he might dare to take up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail again. But a month passed and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that it would be as mad a thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to move on as to climb to the cliff-tops</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leap downward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was water here; So Wuhti brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it laboriously from a hidden spring far back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and deep down in the great fissure in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock wall. If he turned back, he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no more water within thirty miles;</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he went on it was a gamble if he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">find water at the end of forty miles. So he</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited for his strength to come back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly, so slowly that perhaps she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">never aware of it, So Wuhti's silence slip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped from her. She came, in her loneliness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to feel a strange affection for the big-bodied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bahana with his white skin, his yellow hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blue eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had never seen a man like him. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">first she seemed a little in awe of him, a lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle afraid of him. In those first weeks she</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would sit and watch him suspiciously, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips locked, her eyes bright with speculation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, as the Hopi legends have it, woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the daughter of Yahpa, the Mocking-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird, and so, since her father is so great a</seg><seg type="columnLine">talker, may not long remain silent. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">legends of her forefathers were scripture to</seg><seg type="columnLine">So Wuhti.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it turned out that as they sat together</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the old woman's boudoir or upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff-tops, the slow hours passed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throaty monotone of So Wuhti's talk while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup smoked her tobacco in his pipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and listened. It took him no great time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognize the fact that the old woman was</seg><seg type="columnLine">half crazed--a brooding, solitary life and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind filled with superstitions having worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way with her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the main her conversation was an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">genious fabric of lies told with rare sem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blance of truth. As if she were recounting</seg><seg type="columnLine">some minor happening of the day, she told</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a visit she had had from Haruing Wuhti,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief deity of the Hopi polytheism. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">goddess, coming up out of the sea, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come across the desert, running swifter than</seg><seg type="columnLine">an antelope. So beautiful was she that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had hurt So Wuhti's eyes with her beauty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aliksail Listen, Bahana! She is like a soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">white maiden, Haruing Wuhti, her hair yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low like the squash blossom, yellower than</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours. Her eyes are like turquoises, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth as red as a sunset through the sand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm. She came swiftly at So Wuhti's</seg><seg type="columnLine">call. Through the night the goddess sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, So Wuhti here, and they talked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Wuhti shook her head, mumbled, grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent. The Bahana was not to hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things of which Haruing Wuhti and So</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wuhti spoke in the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She explained her presence alone here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She told him of it twice, once in answer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his question, once volunteering the infor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mation. Had she gone into the matter a</seg><seg type="columnLine">third time Northrup had no doubt that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would then have had three instead of mere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly two distinct explanations to choose from.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the first account Northrup found many</seg><seg type="columnLine">traces of ancient Indian religions. So Wuhti</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke familiarly of the beginnings of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world which, while she admitted that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haruing Wuhti and the Sun who had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">the actual work, she herself witnessed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She called Northrup's attention to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that the spot in which he and she were</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the top of the world. Hence it became</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear that it was very distantly remote from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the abiding-place of the chief goddess. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing so far away the goddess must have some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one in whom she could trust to see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything went right. Consequently So</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wuhti, a very great favorite with Haruing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wuhti, was stationed here. When there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was need she built signal fires at the ruined</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch-tower and Haruing saw and under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood the matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  If Northrup didn't take a great deal of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stock in this explanation, he had the other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one: Further in the desert, so far and across</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">such a waterless tract that the white man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could only send his hungry eyes traveling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into it, was a land where there were hidden</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cities. The gods of the underworld had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">built these cities. Then they had given</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them to a people, the people of So Wuhti.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There were seven of these cities, the Sev-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">en Cities of Chebo. (Northrup smiled as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he saw a trace of the old legend told by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">early Spanish explorers of the Seven Cities</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Cibola.) They were very rich cities, hav-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing much silver, many turquoises and of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">late years much gold, which they made into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rings and bracelets, the chiefs having cups</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and plates of gold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In order that they might remain hidden</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the greed of the white men and from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the jealousy of other tribes, they set senti-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nels out through the desert, a hundred</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">miles away. Such a sentinel was So Wuhti.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She had but to set fire to the fagots upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the cliffs and the chiefs of the Hidden Cities</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Chebo would understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Northrup must understand that the gods</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and goddesses were very close to the people</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of So Wuhti. Didn't Haruing Wuhti her-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">self come here to chat with So Wuhti, to eat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">piki with her? It was so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And by living here alone So Wuhti was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing a kindness at once to her people of</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Chebo and to her sovereign deity. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest had told her. As long as she lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">she would watch here. When she was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">die she would build a big fire which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry the word across the desert so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">another might be sent to take her place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then Haruing Wuhti would come for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and throw her cloak about her and So</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wuhti would be a young mana again, living</seg><seg type="columnLine">always where the Big River breaks through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crust and goes into the underworld</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the gods live.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Though the old woman's rambling stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with their innumerable digressions and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">repetitions soon ceased to interest him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup did not fill his canteen and move</seg><seg type="columnLine">on when at last he felt that he was his old,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong self. Half-crazed old savage that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was, So Wuhti was none the less hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Nor was there any denying his obli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gation to her. Had it not been for her he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be now only what the coyotes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong-beaked birds would have left of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And now, strong enough to attempt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage of the desert, he could not fail to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that So Wuhti was coming quickly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of her life, and he could not bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought of going on heartlessly, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to die alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE looked at him curiously many</seg><seg type="columnLine">times during those last few days to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether. She, too, had seen her death</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming to her at last and looked at it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady, curious eyes. She was not afraid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she did not seem sorry to go. She was cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain that Haruing Wuhti was making her</seg><seg type="columnLine">future existences her own concern. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all arranged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had never manifested a hint of emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of any kind since he had seen her beady</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes peering at him through the crack in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocks and now he had been here upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">of six months. He did not expect for a sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of emotion now. Too long had she had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity of looking forward to the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be greatly perturbed by it now that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came with a little shock to him one</seg><seg type="columnLine">day that So Wuhti was all human, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. Out of a still silence by the ruined</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower she had moved to him quickly, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked claw of a hand suddenly fastening</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his forearm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a good man, Bahana," she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes unusually bright upon his. "Many</seg><seg type="columnLine">days ago you were ready to go. You wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">that So Wuhti does not die alone like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coyote. Askwalil I thank you. Haruing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wuhti will bring you many good things. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will tell her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With all of her madness she was not with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out wisdom. She set her chamber in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night; Northrup had the suspicion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in honor of the occasion she even went so</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as to bathe. Then, when the first stars</seg><seg type="columnLine">were coming out she made a trembling way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the cliff-tops, Northrup helping her up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the short ladder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the faint light here Northrup saw how</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had arranged her hair, and the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to him with something of a shock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She had done it up into two whorls, one at</seg><seg type="columnLine">each ear, the imitation of the squash blos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">som which with the Zuni people tells the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time when a maiden has ripened into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first blush of womanhood. So Wuhti was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for the coming of Haruing Wuhti, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time when again she would be beauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful--a young mana.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When at last the great fire, which at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">command he had kindled, had burnt down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup went slowly back into the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber which had so long been So Wuhti's</seg><seg type="columnLine">and which was never again to know her</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence. As he looked at her blankets laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order, folded by hands into which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chill had already crept, when he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken jugs and crocks set in their neat</seg><seg type="columnLine">row, a sudden moisture came into his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So Wuhti had been good to him and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dead. So Wuhti was gone and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonely!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the coolness of the night, having only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stars to guide him, his canteen freshly</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled, he pushed on, out into the desert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONLY because of the great stub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bornness which was a part of him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and because of the unswerving pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose which had grown to be a part of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubbornness, did Sax Northrup battle on</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the desert instead of turning back</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. For fight was it to be at every step,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the ultimate outcome hidden upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees of the barren gods of the Southwest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern Sahara.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Already was he in a land into which men</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not come, where perhaps before him ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men had not ventured since the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Fray Marcos close to four hundred years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago. Here was a region from which a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">might bring back with him nothing but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tale of suffering; where often enough he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might find nothing but a horrible death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And yet Northrup, seeking that which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought, with his eyes open went on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, thinking that he knew the desert,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came to learn that he had never known</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Alone in the silence he came to under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand a little the majesty and power of God.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Day after day, night after night, he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">these things made tangible in the sweep of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sandy floor, in the stern grandeur of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">uplifted walls of rock. Through the frag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of eternal silence through which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought his way he felt these things. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">felt himself a small figure alone in a strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grandeur, majesty, sublimity--he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to be of the desert. But they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the essence of it. Its supreme quality,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen at all times and not to be mistaken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was its savage fierceness. The desert is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypocrite; its teeth are always bared, poi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soned teeth in a snarl at the intruder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatening no less its own offspring. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the land of the iron fang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he battled on, always was he in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart of another battle which had outworn</seg><seg type="columnLine">the youth of time. A struggle to the death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without quarter, and oh, the silence of it!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here about him was no created thing which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desert did not strive to kill.

He saw it fall in a steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">slant. It was raining up there in big drops.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And yet no single drop of water came down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. In the dry air through which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged hissing downward it disappeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk up by the air itself as a drop of mois-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture is drunk up by a dry sand bank.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, turned toward the square of dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, were horrible. And Northrup, bend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over him quickly, had seen no pain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just wicked, venemous hatred in them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The arrow was poisoned and the wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">man knew it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a little room just off the saloon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian told his story to Northrup and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strang. To the latter because he asked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay, since the Indian made no objection,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ii</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">t</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">because Northrup had no reason for privacy</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night the Indian died. But first</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had told his story. Northrup, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his incredulity, saw a keenness of eagerness</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Strang's eyes. And in the end the Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced them both.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look!" he had panted, speaking as swift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly as he might in the Hopi tongue. "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is more--like this!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had managed to squirm over on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed, jerking weakly at something tied about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his body under his shirt. It was Strang's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager hands which did the actual work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a little bag there, made rudely</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a piece of buckskin. And in the bag</seg><seg type="columnLine">were two gold nuggets and half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">turquoises.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why do you give this to me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup had demanded. "You came here</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for me. I don't know you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know you," the Indian had answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where hard things get done, I hear your</seg><seg type="columnLine">name.

Listen with both</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made his description of the trail to</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel swiftly, seeming to have each great</seg><seg type="columnLine">or minor direction in mind, as if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully arranged every detail already.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From Coyote Gap Northrup was to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight toward the rising sun where it lift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed between the two peaks in the Spanish</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mountains, the peaks known as Los Dos</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hermanos. There, in the pass, was water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was not over ten miles from Coyote Gap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, before going further, the Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">had wriggled up, his back against the wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had seized pencil and paper from North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look," he had said, making a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark. "This is where the north star is.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You can always find the place of the Kwinae</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wuhtaka--North Old Man--on the desert?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Day and night, by the stars?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup nodded.

The Indian grunted his satisfaction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," the Hopi had said at the end,</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing the same readiness which So Wuhti</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed months later to meet the Skeleton</seg><seg type="columnLine">Old Man half-way, "it is done. You will go,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for there is gold at the end of it all, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">where there is gold, if it is under hot rocks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a white man will go. The other Bahana,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking shrewdly into Strang's brightening</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, "will go also.

Here he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found animal life, cotton-tails and jack-rab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bits for the most part and a few birds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were tame, having no doubt never set</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bright round eyes upon a thing which</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked upright as he did, and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What he needed Northrup killed, either</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his automatic or with stones.

But always he</seg><seg type="columnLine">forged on; never did the thought of turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">back come to him. He knew that Strang</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone ahead, Strang for whom he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a mild sort of contempt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He passed successively the points he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked "Cave Rocks," where he spent two</seg><seg type="columnLine">days and a half in interested exploration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broken remnants of a civilization which</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been many centuries old before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Spaniards came into the New World;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Skeleton, where, as the Hopi had fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">told, he came upon the sun-bleached bones</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what must at one time been a veritable</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant of a man, now a pile of bones no long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er of interest to preying animals where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay upon the top of an overhanging boulder;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poison Springs where there were more skele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tons, these of thirst-tormented, unwary ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals; the Sunken Meadows which might</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have been originally the home of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world's butterflies, and where many re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained, great-winged, incredibly swift, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might live at all through the eternal</seg><seg type="columnLine">warfare which the bird - folk here waged</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them, where humming-birds bright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened the air and mocking-birds shook out</seg><seg type="columnLine">their cool, clear notes against desert sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">and silence; into the ancient realm of cliff-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwellers where he saw countless orifices</seg><seg type="columnLine">punctured into the cliffs a hundred, five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet above some spring where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">camped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the weeks wore on and he entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">more deeply into the heart of the unknown,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup became possessed of a faith in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the undertaking which had not been with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him at the outset. Then he had thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll go and see." Now he felt, "I'll go and</seg><seg type="columnLine">find!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The very fact that every day he had con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant proof of the Hopi's truthfulness began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work its spell upon him. Why should</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the tale then prove fiction? Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hourly drawing nearer the desert trea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure-house?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ACROSS bare, blistering miles he</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed his trail that led him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">those deathless springs which in old</seg><seg type="columnLine">times had made these arid lands an open</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughfare to moccasined feet. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were times in those long, silent days of utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">solitude when, far to right or left, he fan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cied he saw along high cliffs the remains of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old civilization, man-made trails in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock, rudely circular holes in the precipices</seg><seg type="columnLine">which well may have led into cool, cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered dwellings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was risking too much to seek to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigate here where distances are deceptive</seg><seg type="columnLine">and water is not assured. Nor did he have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inclination to linger. His quest had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten into his blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The time came at last when, standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear and distinct in the north, he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of cliffs marking his journey's end. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled now at night, since the moon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the full. Through the loose sand which</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed one instant to give away as freely</seg><seg type="columnLine">as water only to grasp at his ankles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold him back the next, he plowed on all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night, his face set toward the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">star. In the moonlight the desert about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him was touched into a softness of beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was no attribute of it in the harsh</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of day; the distant mountains looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">unreal, mystically lovely, the borders of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairyland.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What sort of people were the men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">women who lived this, knew no life but</seg><seg type="columnLine">this?" was Northrup's thought over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. "The warriors, were they as hard as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desert by day? The maidens, were they</seg><seg type="columnLine">as savage as their lovers? Or did the soft-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of desert moonlight, the tenderness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert colorings seep into their souls?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toward dawn, from a gently sloping</seg><seg type="columnLine">loma, he saw the clump of trees, mesquite</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the most part, betokening the spot where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was to water and rest. From here, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coolness of another dusk came, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">press 011--over the last lap of the quest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That day he dozed restlessly, dreaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken dreams from which he started up</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeatedly, muttering. The scenes through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had so long traveled had had their</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper impressions upon him and suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild thoughts which in sleep were uncheck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed. The speculation of what might lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead mingled with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt all night as if he were in the grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some power other than his own, not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be explained by materialistic mankind. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed that the old peoples who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">striven with the desert for existence, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had mastered it and lived through it, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not dead; that they still had their moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain fastnesses; that he moved among them;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that strange adventures were his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toward late afternoon, too restlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager for further rest, he ate, drank, filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his canteens and struck out for the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains. And before he had gone a mile, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the sun had wheeled down toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the hottest day he had yet experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enced, a thing occurred which sent a thrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the man's physical being, a fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock of wonderment into his heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before him were the heat waves trembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a wide expanse of barren sand. Sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">for miles in each direction, the white, loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand which one finds in wind - tumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">dunes, like the white sand of the seashore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but waterless. Then slowly into the empti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of burning air there grew a vision. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked upon it at first with little interest;</seg><seg type="columnLine">this sort of thing could hardly interest him</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all these years of life upon the fringe</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the desert, he thought. But, ten steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">further he grew stock still, his heart thump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wildly, the old sense of the supernatural</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw, woven into the semblance of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">reality from sunlight and air, hanging in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air close to the ground, like some master's</seg><seg type="columnLine">painting suspended by invisible ropes, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene of rare beauty, of mad beauty, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this bleak stretch of scant vegetation. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a garden a hundred feet across, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall, lush, water-loving flowers such as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never seen before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the heart of the garden a pool of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">with shade-trees dropping leaves into it, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pool not of nature's making but of man's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For surely its basin was white rock which</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's hand had carved and scooped out;</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely there stood carven pillars and col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umns of white stone about it. The water</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone at him with a blue laughter, the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rock glistened like snow; the grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plants flung emerald reflections at</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves; the blossoms everywhere were</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple and scarlet and deep rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clearer and clearer grew the desert vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">until Northrup, seeing a bright-colored par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rot drop from a swaying branch like a float-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing flower, caught his breath in wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!" cried Northrup sharply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Have I gone mad?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew the way in which the thirst-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torment ends: in forgetfulness of what one</seg><seg type="columnLine">has suffered, in delicious delirium, in fancies</seg><seg type="columnLine">like this thing which his two eyes told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">was physical fabric.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes had followed the gaudy flight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parrot. And so they came to see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had not seen before, to trick him into</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking he saw what he would not believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">existed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hand had been thrown out--never mi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage like this if this in sober truth were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">magic's masterpiece--a slow-moving, grace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful hand, a bare arm of rare perfection. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">parrot had perched upon a finger, seeming</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cock a suspicious, jealous head toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup. So Northrup had seen the hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arm, the maiden herself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was lying upon her side, an arm flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, an arm under her head. He saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose hair about her face, saw--or fancied</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw, for his senses were reeling--the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, the lips curving to languid laughter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the white robe girt about with a broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">band of blue, saw the crimson flower set</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the brown throat, saw the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare feet from which the white moccasins</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fallen. And then--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the air had wavered and shimmered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clouded and cleared, and Sax Northrup</seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself staring out across an empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch of white sand, drifted here and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the desert winds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TONIGHT the wind rose with sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">set, sweeping across the desert in</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong gusts. The white drifts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand were disposed anew, in fresh designs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sand, carried in level strata, cut at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup's face and hands, stinging him</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmercifully like fine particles of heated</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within an hour the wind dropped. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparse grass here and there was motionless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was stifling hot for another hour. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">came sudden cold through which Northrup</seg><seg type="columnLine">made swifter progress. At dawn he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the mountains were not ten miles away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could come to them long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as the sun rose, the wind came up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it, blowing again in mighty gusts, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">settling into a steady storm from the north.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every step of the way now Northrup fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard. The wind whipped the moisture out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his body until his skin seemed to be on fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bend his head as he might, the sand found</seg><seg type="columnLine">its way under his hat-brim, cutting his face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving through his shirt-collar, slipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere into his clothing, running into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his boots. An hour after sun-up it was fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully hot; the sun was a small ball looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">very far away yet smoldering with an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense red heat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hoarded his water, but again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again his dry throat drove him to lift his</seg><seg type="columnLine">canteen to his lips. He sought to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains ahead of him and could not make</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the dimmest outline.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The flying sand would have hidden them</seg><seg type="columnLine">had they been less than a tenth of the ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles distant. It had smothered the world;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was choking, stifling him. He tied a</seg><seg type="columnLine">handkerchief about his face and threw him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to the ground. He could make no prog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ress against that fierce, raging storm from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the north. He knew the folly of matching</seg><seg type="columnLine">his strength against it. At this rate he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have exhausted his force, drunk his</seg><seg type="columnLine">water in an hour, and then the piling, drift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, flying sand would work its grim way</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He began to think the storm would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never end. The darkness into which mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day was plunged grew thicker; the sun was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a terrible, unearthly thing, dim and red.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Until far in the afternoon the sand-storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept upon him, racing away into the south</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sound of distant booming, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistle of dry sand upon dry wind. Little</seg><seg type="columnLine">by little it subsided, the air thinned, a vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">blur looking at the end of the world marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup lifted his canteen. He had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little water, perhaps two cupfuls, left. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">drank sparingly and, fearful lest the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">might rise again, blowing for many days as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew it did at times, he forced his heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">way northward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved like a ghost through a mist of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand all that day. The wind came and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">in gusts, dying down utterly toward sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">set. The air cleared then, the mountains rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">steeper, came marching to meet him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">drank the last drop of water and pushed on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moonrise found him, beaten and grimy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the mouth of the great canon toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had journeyed. He hurried on</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the canon. There were black shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere about him. But slowly as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on the shadows drew into themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the moon climbed higher.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here, on each side of him, were the walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the canon, lifted up in sheer cliffs. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready the cliffs were a hundred feet high;</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead he could see that they stood up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky seven hundred, a thousand feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The canon where he stood was perhaps fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards in width; a little further on it widen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed out to three times fifty yards, narrowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">again rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now Northrup's eyes were concerned</seg><seg type="columnLine">not with the walls of rock but with the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the canon. He wanted water, wanted it</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly. All day he had been stinted for it;</seg><seg type="columnLine">now he must have it, and soon. His throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">ached and burned; his tongue felt thick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff in his mouth; his whole body cried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him for water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He believed that he had come to the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">canon; it was as the Hopi had described it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying due north of the last water-hole, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tallest peak towering above it. If in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sand-storm he had lost his bearings, why</seg><seg type="columnLine">then so much the worse for a foolhardy ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venturer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR an hour he sought water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ImuS found none. His thirst was tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menting him, driving him mad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The moonlight glistening from a white slab</seg><seg type="columnLine">of granite tricked him; he hurried stumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to it only to twist his lips into a silent curse</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he saw clearly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sucked at his canteen and in sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrath threw it from him. A moment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror came upon him in which he ran here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there blindly. He jerked himself to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether with anger at himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went to the flat-topped boulder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down. He needed rest almost as badly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he needed water. And he must get him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The orb of the moon silvered the cliffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">above him. Northrup sent his eyes quest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing everywhere, even up the cliffs. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">something move, a wolf he supposed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't interested in wolves; it was water he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But his eyes remained a moment with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sign of life, hundreds of feet above him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The moving thing came out from a blotch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shadow and stood upon the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff. It was not a wolf, it was a man, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">else the trickery of the moon was building</seg><seg type="columnLine">another taunting vision for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moving form, coming to the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge, stood still. Northrup saw the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinctly, almost straight up above him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The face was in profile, etched clear against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky. It was the face of an Indian, Hopi</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, but handsomer than the Hopi</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup had known, the nose prominent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the features sharply cut and clear. The In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dian was naked save for the white loin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloth and the band about his head. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms were flung out toward the moon as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">in supplication, his body rigid a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head lifted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup sought to call out, and a dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper in his tortured throat fell hissingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his own ears. He sprang up, striving</seg><seg type="columnLine">again to call. But the form above him was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. The man had drawn back from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff-edge; the moonlight silvered the rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hastily Northrup sought the way up</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, knowing that he must come upon this</seg><seg type="columnLine">man before he was beyond call. He might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have used his gun to attract attention--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of that now--but already his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">had found the first of the rude steps in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff and he was climbing rapidly. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to the top, then if the man were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be seen he would use the gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Northrup's head rose slowly above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the cliff he stopped suddenly, a lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle gasp in his throat. Here was a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelf against the precipice, the cliffs falling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly to the desert below, rising sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">another five hundred feet back of the level</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. The space, itself some hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in length and half of that in width, appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him like some mighty stage set for one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desert's wild extravaganzas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw not one man but fifty, a hundred;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not estimate how many. All were</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the first, gaunt-bodied, clothed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loin-cloth of pure white, their bodies glis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tening in the moonlight like polished bronze.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were moving about in a slow, stately</seg><seg type="columnLine">procession, their arms lifted to the moon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their faces upturned, their forms swaying</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhythmically as they circled about a form</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing above them upon a flat boulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Along the cliff wall upon the far side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">level space Northrup saw other forms, these</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shadow, clothed in white robes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether of native cotton or buckskin he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not tell, the forms of matrons and</seg><seg type="columnLine">maidens, scores of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not a sound had come to him. The feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving in the wide circle were bare feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling lightly upon a floor of rock. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips opened, moving in unison as if some</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty chant were bursting from them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And yet no sound of singing came to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was as still here as it was out ten miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the sands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The form standing upon the boulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">about which the others circled, was that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old man. Northrup saw the hooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">beak of a nose like a hawk's, the hair falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the shoulders, silver under the moon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black eyes filled with a strange ecstasy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then the black eyes saw him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just Northrup's head coming up slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the void below', a great head of yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, disheveled hair, a great yellow beard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unkempt and made over into gold by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night light, great blue eyes looking fierce as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wolf's from the thirst upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet the ceremonial dance, if such it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, went on with no pause. The old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood still, his arms outflung, his lips mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as the lips of the others moved. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen Northrup, he had seemed then to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup came slowly up to the ledge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his big body seeming unnaturally large when</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last he stood upon a level w'ith the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Water!" he cried hoarsely. "I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">water."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had spoken in English. His voice cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">rudely into the silence. Those wrho had</seg><seg type="columnLine">i6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not seen him before saw him now. A hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred looks turned upon him, swift and</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled. For a moment the swaying bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">and moving lips grew as still as the rocks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then again the bodies swayed, the lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved, the silent circle continued as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not broken into it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Water!" cried Northrup again, moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward them heavily like some great tawny-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maned lion, wrath in his eyes. And in half</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen tongues, dialects of the southwest</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hurled the word at them:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Water. I want water!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A fierce anger surged into Northrup's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. Would these copper-bodied devils</seg><seg type="columnLine">of silence keep on with their mad dance</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Sax Northrup was dying of thirst?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He bore down upon them, the voice in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his throat harsh and savage. They gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">back before him, moving but a little to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, their bodies still swaying, their lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">still moving. But he saw that the scores of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were turned upon him wonderingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he came almost to the boulder upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the old man stood. He saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this one was clad differently from the others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long robe hanging from his shoulders, girt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed about by a broad band of red, a chain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass beads--or were they turquoises?--</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the forehead, holding the hair back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had come almost to this man, thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to be the one in authority here, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found another of the bronze bodies in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup plunged toward him, but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">man did not move aside. He was taller</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the others, Northrup noted, gaunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodied like them, but with mighty sinews</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing out upon shoulders and arms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thighs, a man as tall as Northrup.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup threw out his arm to thrust this</seg><seg type="columnLine">man aside, his one thought to come to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man. But his arm struck a body hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">like rock, unyielding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"-you!" shouted Northrup. "Stand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">aside. I want water!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man's body was swaying gently with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other swaying bodies, his lips moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the other moving lips, his eyes fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less and stubborn and filled with threat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup's two hands shot out, gripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bare shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Until now he had seen no sign of a weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">among these people. But suddenly a knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">had leaped out in this man's right hand, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlight running down the thin, keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">blade. And still no sound save Northrup's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy breathing and scuffling feet and an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gry, snarling voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup's rage was like the rage of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad desert animal. As the knife-blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept upward, preparatory for the down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward blow, Northrup struck. His big fist</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammered straight into the Indian's face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knife clattered to the rocks, the Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggering back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In an instant Northrup was upon him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had caught the lean body in his hungering</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, had dragged it to the cliff's edge, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted it high in air until the bronzed limbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood out against the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, his savage blood-lust gone as swift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly as it had come, he had cast the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon the ledge at his feet, turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly toward the other forms which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased swaying at last. And as he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard a burst of laughter, the soft, tin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kling laughter of a woman. Out of silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had drawn this thing, a woman's laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">bubbling over with mirth like the overflow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a sparkling fountain. And then he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond the stone where the old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood was a narrow rift in the wall of rock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deep in the rift was a blazing fire, throwing</seg><seg type="columnLine">into relief the form which had come out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it. The form of a girl, her left arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shoulder bare and brown, a single stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">or bead gleaming upon her forehead, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender form clad in a long, loose robe of</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, her feet encased in moccasins of white</seg><seg type="columnLine">buckskin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And her eyes under her dusky hair laugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, fcer red lips laughed. And as if an echo</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her laughter came the laughter of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaudy-plumaged parrot perched upon her</seg><seg type="columnLine">round wrist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup stared at her in amazement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking himself staring at some soft maid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">en of the Orient. He forgot the others, for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">got the man at his feet who had rolled over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dark hand going swiftly to the knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the rock. He thought of it in time</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of what he saw in the girl's eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No sound after the laughter had died</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, no single word. But in her eyes was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a language which was not to be misunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood. There was anger there now, a wrath</seg><seg type="columnLine">which blazed as brightly as Northrup's had.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And there was a command. Her eyes, pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing beyond Northrup, were upon the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She lifted her hand as if putting a cup of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water to her lips. Then she nodded briefly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at the man who stood so close to Northrup</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the knife shaking in his hand. North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup, turning, saw again the picture of an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger there, but an anger sullen and hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He again looked to the girl. Her hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing at this man, made again the swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture of lifted cup, then swept in a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc, pointing into the rift in the rock walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which the fire gleamed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup found himself watching as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have done were this in reality some</seg><seg type="columnLine">extravaganza and he in his seat in the audi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence. He read the command in the girl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">furious eyes, the hesitation and sullen rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the man's, the wonder in other eyes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that looked like fear, a look of</seg><seg type="columnLine">baffled fury in the eyes of the old man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long robe. And then he was following</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man with the knife, passing through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long lane of silent, watchful figures, going</seg><seg type="columnLine">after his guide through the narrow passage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way into the cliffs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an instant, as he was passing close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the girl stood at the mouth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleft, Northrup paused, his eyes turned curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously upon her. Her eyes met his steadily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes whose color was elusive there in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlight. He could only tell that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were big, dark and lustrous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A word of thanks upon his lips was check-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed by what he read in her quick expression.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl's gaze had swept him from the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his tousled yellow hair to the sole of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusty boots. Her look, meeting his again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was filled with admiration; her thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood out plainly, with no attempt at con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cealment. It was as if she had opened her</seg><seg type="columnLine">red mouth and said softly, wonderingly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are the biggest man, the most won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful, the most handsome I have ever look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed upon!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup's face reddened suddenly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went on, merely bowing deeply as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed. He saw the face of the man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knife; this man too had read the girl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression and his features were twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with malicious rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">r NORTHRUP, forcing himself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink slowly, looked about him be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween sips of the cold water. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had followed his guide through the narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleft, by the fagot fire, up a series of wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, uneven steps in the rock and out upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a second ledge, some distance to the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first and some fifty feet higher.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here, in a niche in the rock, was a clay</seg><seg type="columnLine">water-jug, brimming. Above rose the cliffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">precipitately upon one side; upon the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">they fell straight down to the more gentle</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope of the foothills. There was-no sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitation here, nothing to bespeak human</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupation of these heights save the water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jug and the Indian who had brought him</seg><seg type="columnLine">here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turning, Northrup looked back down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rude stairs and through the cut in the rocks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Upon the lower ledge the old man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing upon the boulder, his arms lifted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face upturned, his lips moving. About</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the bronze figures, naked save for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loin-cloths, were passing noiselessly, bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying rhythmically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl with the parrot upon her wrist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slender, peeled willow-rod tipped with</seg><seg type="columnLine">feathers in her hand, was watching them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her Ups moved with the others, her lithe</seg><seg type="columnLine">body swayed with theirs, the feather-tipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">rod in her hand beat time to the voiceless</seg><seg type="columnLine">singing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man at Northrup's side had slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently away, his bare feet falling noise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly upon the rock staircase. Swiftly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down, dropping from sight, reappear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing by the fire, passing out upon the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge to take once more his place in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circling about the old man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was the desert in all truth a place be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">witched? And were these voiceless beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">the band of sorcerers brewing black magic</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cast out through the moonlight and over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world? What strange race of tongue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less people was this upon which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled, following the wild tale of a dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian down in Santa Fe? And--suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the question which had not presented itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">for many days came back to him now--who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Tiyo?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup shrugged his shoulders in an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer to his own questioning and again lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water-jug to his lips, drinking more</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply now. Time would answer him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the meantime he was not going to die of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunger and thirst. He sat down upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">verge of the higher ledge, filled his pipe and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting, watched what went on below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the greater part of an hour the silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">circling continued. Then, at no signal</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he could see, it ceased suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking off with abrupt finality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl with the parrot, walking slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">i8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">between the two long lines of bronze figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had drawn up and grown motionless</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her passing, went to the boulder where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man in the white robe stood. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reached down she put her hand up, tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one of his. She carried it to her lips,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the action filled with reverence. The old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man stood above her like one great in power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">undisputed in authority, accepting homage</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reverence as his due; the girl's attitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one of rare humbleness and humility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in an instant the parts had changed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As she had dropped the withered hand, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man had slipped down from his place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of eminence. In a moment he had sunk to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knees, had lifted the blue embroidered</seg><seg type="columnLine">fringe of her robe, had carried it to his lips.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the girl's air had suddenly undergone a</seg><seg type="columnLine">change lightning swift. Her head was lift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, the round throat showing brown and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare through the opening in her robe; she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gathered her small height so that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked tall; her manner was subtly arro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gant, queenly proud. As the kneeling fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure looked up at her the reverence was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes, the power and dignity in hers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the land of mad folks!" grunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man knowing as much as Northrup of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Indians of the Southwest, such as dwell</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Oraibi, Walpi, ancient Taos, throughout</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desert lands of New Mexico, Arizona,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Utah, knows with what tenacity they cling</seg><seg type="columnLine">to traditions which were old centuries be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the armored Spaniard came hi to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">New World. He knew them for a deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">religious people, their beliefs stoutly main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained in the face of alien interference, filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with ceremony and symbolism. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this thing which he was watching was</seg><seg type="columnLine">some rite deeply important to these people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and could only watch, wondering vaguely</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it portended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Among savage people there is perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">even less difficulty in selecting at a glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "higher-ups" than among a people who</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone further with civilization. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready Northrup recognized the very ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vious fact that the persons to be reckoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with here were the old man in the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">robe, a priest, without doubt, the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with the knife, and the girl. And now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakening a keener interest in him, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knowledge that, for the moment at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least, it was the girl to whom all eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned with reverence and obedience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She lifted the rod in her hand, a baho, or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">prayer-stick, no doubt, and once more the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent circle was described, the old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading, the young fellow with the wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful physique following, the others taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">their places behind him. And all of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing under the outstretched baho, stoop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed swiftly to lift the hem of her garment to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lips. She looked over their bent heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">with bright eyes, like a young queen just</seg><seg type="columnLine">come into her birthright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a little they had all passed by her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in silent procession had come through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">defile in the rocks, mounting the crooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps, passing by Northrup with sharp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">black eyes turned upon him, across the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond ledge and down at the far side, seeming</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him to drop one by one into the void be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After them came the women, matrons</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, with their hair arranged in Hopi fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion, done low at each side, the maidens with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hair massed into two great whorls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one at each ear, flashing quick glances of</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity at him. Upon the lower ledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">now were five figures only, the girl with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parrot and the two maidens who stood a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little back of her, one on each side, the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and the man with whom Northrup</seg><seg type="columnLine">had struggled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the girl was making swift gestures</seg><seg type="columnLine">which for a little perplexed the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched her from above, though her com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions seemed readily enough to grasp her</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning. Across the few feet which separ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated them, Northrup could catch their ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressions as clearly as if it had been the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of the round moon hanging above</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Into the eyes of the old man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two attendant maidens came a quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">look of horror; into the eyes of the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">man a look of black anger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl, seeing what Northrup saw, lift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed her head a little higher, her eyes grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">brighter, suddenly hard as rock. The ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture again and Northrup knew that it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to do with him. For the feather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tipped willow-rod was pointed toward him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then out across the ledge where the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone, then to the young man before her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man seemed upon the verge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking. But, still with locked lips, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head vigorously. The girl whirl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed upon him, her attitude filled with sover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eign menace, and he drew back swiftly as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of her. The two maidens, eyes wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips parted breathlessly, stared in sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement at her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">19</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the girl with the parrot had whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, her back upon the old man, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of contempt in the action, her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing at the younger man. The gesture</seg><seg type="columnLine">came swift and imperious. The fellow who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already felt Northrup's fist, and whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips were swollen because he had, grew sul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">len, shaking his head with determined re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl took a swift step toward him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he held his ground obstinately. Suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face showing the fury upon her, she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted the prayer-stick as if she would strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with it. The thing was a slender rod</seg><seg type="columnLine">which a man might break between thumb</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forefinger. And yet it was the sacred</seg><seg type="columnLine">bahol</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup thought that he heard a gasp;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew that what looked like shaking fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">had descended from the rod still held aloft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The old man and the young had stooped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifting the hem of her garment, and the girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her lips curved into a victor's smile, turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">her back upon all of them and came through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the defile, to the higher ledge and to North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup's side. She flashed him a smile which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with triumph, was not without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmth of the admiration which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her eyes when he had passed her. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she went across the ledge, pausing at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brink to look back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man and the two maidens had</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed her. The other man, his face con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulsed, his eyes like knives, came to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup was now standing. For a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, the two men looking into each other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, had a glimpse of what might lie in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future. Then again Northrup was follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his guide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl, seeming satisfied, went down</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the edge of the cliff. Northrup, follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his guide, found other steps there, wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing downward and turning about a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">knob of rock. And then, startled by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he might have expected, he was look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down into the garden with the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock basin, the white stone columns, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pool of water and the green-leafed trees he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen in the mirage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here was a third broad ledge, the cliffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the back curving outward over it, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most like a roof. Close under this over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging precipice was a building, rudely</seg><seg type="columnLine">square, built of white stone and cement</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one wide door set between two pillars</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were half a dozen square openings</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wall, their use as windows obvious.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Upon the flat roof were green things grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and the great blossoms looking either</seg><seg type="columnLine">white or black in the fainter light there. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple, Northrup guessed. He was to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">differently soon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the side of the pool the girl with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parrot had stopped. The bird, fluttering</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her wrist, perched upon a limb which</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent and swayed with him. The old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the younger one, who had guided</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup here, made again the deep obei-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sance and passed on, going to the far edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this ledge and passing down other steps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of sight. The two attendant maidens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their eyes still wide with surprise and won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, waited a few steps from their mistress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again a quick imperious gesture as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned upon them. They moved back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, going from her to the stone building,</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappearing through the wide door. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl who had remained turned slowly, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes upon Northrup.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a little she stood looking at him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep soberness, her oval face like a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">child's in its unaffected interest and curios-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity. Then suddenly--it seemed that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">did all things with rare swiftness excepting</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the mood or pose of languor was upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">her--a smile touched her lips into gentle</seg><seg type="columnLine">curves, her face dimpled up at him, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">low in her throat came a little burst of</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ishohil In your big hands did Tiyo</seg><seg type="columnLine">look a little bug squirming! For that, Ba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hana, I thank you! Askwalil"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tiyo?" grunted Northrup. "So the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleman with the carving-knife is our old</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend Tiyo, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The words, coming with the little start</seg><seg type="columnLine">of surprise, found utterance quite natural-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly in English. In the same tongue he added,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You pretty thing! I wonder if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know you are the prettiest girl I ever saw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">red, black, yellow or white?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked at him frankly puzzled, shak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her head slowly. Northrup laughed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Speaking in the tongue his many months</seg><seg type="columnLine">with So Wuhti had perfected he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was just mentioning my delight at</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting up with Tiyo. I have heard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She showed her pleasure at his speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">words which she could understand by clap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping her hands. But, again very sober in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her regard of him, lifting her face upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">20</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">until the wonder was he didn't kiss her</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempting mouth then and there, she studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a moment and then declared as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite satisfied and convinced:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are beautiful, Bahana! You are</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Sikangvvunuptu! Your eyes are like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skies one sees from the mountain-tops.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Your hair is like gold, more beautiful than</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She came closer, putting up her hand in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that swift way of hers until her fingers gent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly brushed the hair at his temple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, you are like the God of the Yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dawn."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup whistled. And then, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt like a fool for it, he blushed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt his face getting red, as red as fire. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, seeing his embarrassment, laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, her mirth rippling out through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">still night, as pure and clean a thing as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlight itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You little devil!" muttered the man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She lifted her brows, making again the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign that she did not understand. Then for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant Northrup lost sight of her in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new vision which appeared abruptly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had thought that Tiyo and the old priest</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone on down the rocks somewhere;</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently they had contented themselves by</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely going down over the edge and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maining there just out of sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For, as if some one had pulled a string</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they both were puppets answering to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jerk, their two heads appeared again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man's face twisted evilly into a crim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son rage, Tiyo's eyes filled with horror and</seg><seg type="columnLine">an anger like the priest's. Even the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">maidens who had disappeared through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide doorway were back at the entrance; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to Northrup that their dark faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">had grown ashy. He was positive that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had clutched at each other and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were trembling. He turned question-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing eyes back to the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If before she had taken upon herself a</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeming of queenliness, now she was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an angry goddess. A moment ago one</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not have looked into the limpid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing pools which were her eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">have imagined that they could change so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They blazed with an anger which was great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er than Tiyo's and the priest's; they shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a menace which was hard enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspire one with terror. Northrup saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the two men held their places there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came quickly into their look a certain hint</seg><seg type="columnLine">of uneasiness; the two maidens had fled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">into the dark interior of the stone building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why do you linger, Inaa Wuhtaka</seg><seg type="columnLine">(Father Old Man)?" she said with a tone</seg><seg type="columnLine">which knew the way to be at once cool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady and deadly. "Why, Tiyo, do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring back into the presence of Yahoya</seg><seg type="columnLine">your evil face, unbidden? Do you wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya's blessing? Or her curse perhaps?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The baho in her hand lifted a little, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very, very little. But the gesture was sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificant. Both men started back as if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been struck across the faces. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only anger again to be read in the priest's</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenance, he began a series of frantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs which Northrup, looking on in won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derment, was at loss to read, but which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl seemed to grasp readily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Inaa," she said gently, quite as a moth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er might speak to a forward child, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">his years must have numbered seventy at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the least, while the maiden was at the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">blush of womanhood. "I understand what</seg><seg type="columnLine">your locked lips whisper. Your speech</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes from your heart and so it is kind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But you will remember, Inaa, that though</seg><seg type="columnLine">a priest you are only a man whose path goes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way soon of the Skeleton House. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will not forget, Inaa, who is Yahoya!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Go! Tiyo goes with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thin old hands lifted in protest drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped hopelessly; with no word Inaa, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiyo with him, went over the cliffs and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sight. Northrup, filled more than ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">with curiosity, turned to the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is like an old sheep, is Inaa," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled with pleasant disrespect for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloth. "All white wool and little brain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Tiyo--Tiyo is his son."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you," said Northrup, wondering at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all he had seen. "You are--Yahoya, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great lady--a princess?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her smile was as serene as the moonbeam</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the still pool as she answered him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stating quite simply as the most matter-of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact thing in the world:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am Yahoya--a goddess!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I -- I see," stammered Northrup</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he could think of anything to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say. "I--I might have known it. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never saw a goddess before, but--oh, yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're a goddess, all right!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Yahoya simply, dimpling at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him quite like a maiden of flesh and blood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether adorable. "I am Yahoya, chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">Y ahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">21</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">goddess of the 'People of the Hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spring,' sister of Haruing Wuhti, daughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Cotukvnangi, god of thunder, mother of</seg><seg type="columnLine">T-okila, the Night, bride of Pookhonghoya,</seg><seg type="columnLine">god of war."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup bowed and remembered to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">off his hat. From the comer of his eye he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the goddess Yahoya in stupefac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Was she poking fun at him or did</seg><seg type="columnLine">she believe all of that stuff?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The question need not go begging for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer. Her whole being breathed the cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainty that she was what she had said she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. The attitude of Inaa the priest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his evil-eyed son Tiyo backed up her belief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were all so certain of the thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup, a little dazed, asked himself:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, why not? Everything happens</seg><seg type="columnLine">here! Why not find oneself in the presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of deity?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he admitted that she looked the part</seg><seg type="columnLine">•--all except being the mother of Tokila, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Night, or of anything else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is the Festival of Silence," the god-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dess was explaining to him in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet way. "At such time it is death to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make so much as a little sound with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips, death to a mortal. But I, being an</seg><seg type="columnLine">immortal, may do as I please. You, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">bidden by me, may speak. Inaa," and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed again, mirthfully as at a rare</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, "Inaa is afraid of the Skeleton Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man. But most of all is he afraid of me!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," said Northrup, gathering his wits.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Exactly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned a little and led the way close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the pool of water in the white basin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">along its side and to what appeared to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge panther-skin cast upon the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a drooping tree. Here she seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself, stretching out, making herself com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable, lying as he knew she had been ly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing when the sorcery of the atmosphere had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown her to him across the desert. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parrot was upon a swaying branch</seg><seg type="columnLine">above her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be seated, Bahana," she said lightly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We shall talk. My lips are tired with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long silence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup's tired body was not averse to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepting the invitation. He sat just at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fringe of the shadow of the tree, a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps from her, where he could see the play</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her features. And already he began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget his weariness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yesterday, in the late afternoon," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said with the impulse upon him, "you were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lying here, upon the panther-skin. Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair was loose, all about your shoulders;</seg><seg type="columnLine">your little moccasins had fallen off and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not notice. You wore a flower at your</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat. Your bird was in the tree there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He dropped down and perched upon your</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yahoya, without sitting up, looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, a little startled, hers now the time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you were not here to see, Bahana."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I was out yonder," he answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" 'Way out on the desert."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then," she cried a little breathlessly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you too are a god! Not a Bahana but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deity. You are perhaps, him I said you</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked to be, Sikangwunuptu, God of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yellow Dawn! Ishohil"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had twisted over, her graceful body</seg><seg type="columnLine">little less pantherine in its movements than</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been the body upon whose skin she</seg><seg type="columnLine">now lay, and slipped to her feet, standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wondering what thing she was going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do next, Northrup sat still watching her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was making him a curtsey or an obei-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sance, he wasn't quite sure which. Any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way it was pretty and decidedly worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching. He was already asking himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">why white girls didn't have half the charm</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this wild thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are Sikangwunuptu!" she was cry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing softly. "You, a great god of the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, have come up to visit at the kiva of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya, Chief Goddess of the People of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Hidden Spring! You are more beauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful than a man because you are more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man. You have the strength of ten Tiyos</seg><seg type="columnLine">because you are an immortal. See. I, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">am immortal,I, the Goddess Yahoya! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet I, even I, kneel before Sikangwunuptu,</seg><seg type="columnLine">great God of the Yellow Dawn!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, true enough, the impetuous creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sunk to her knees, throwing out her</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, brown arms as in supplication. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">parrot, perhaps bewildered at seeing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistress act so, gave utterance to a nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">squawk, fluttered over her head, availed</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself of a vicious snap at Northrup and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back to his tree to watch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup in his wanderings up and down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world had seen little of womankind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew little of her and her ways. In all es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentials he sat spellbound for an instant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly grasping Yahoya's intent. But in</seg><seg type="columnLine">another second when her two hands had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found his two and were lifting them to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">22</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lips he realized that, savage or goddess, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was getting into the way of making him</seg><seg type="columnLine">blush and that he didn't like it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here," he said quickly. "My</seg><seg type="columnLine">name's Sax Northrup, if you want it. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm hungry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yahoya laughed lightly. Northrup</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't sure that he knew what inspired her</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter. She seemed to be built of mirth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was on her feet again in a flash, drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping him another of her quaint little bows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her dark eyes dancing. Then she had cup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped her two hands to her mouth and called.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her two maidens came pattering in bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet across the stone courtyard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nayangap Mana! Tocha Mana!" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried softly to them when, hesitant and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide-eyed, they stood before their mistress,</seg><seg type="columnLine">darting swift, curious glances at Northrup.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are in the presence of the gods!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As if this were a signal and they grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">it instantly, the two not uncomely maidens</seg><seg type="columnLine">plumped down upon their knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen!" went on Yahoya swiftly. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom you see before you is one come up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the underworld to have speech with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya. Guard your eyes that they go</seg><seg type="columnLine">not blind with looking upon him. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sikangwunuptu!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly four brown hands flew up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide four very bright and inquisitive eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup fancied, while he was not certain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the girl called Nayangap was peeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him through her fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He has come running across the desert,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued Yahoya. "Therefore is he hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gry. He does not carry water with him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">men do; therefore he thirsts. Hasten!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Northrup, missing the canteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been with him so long, came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember how in a fit of anger he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown it away down in the canon, Nayan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gap and Tocha had flitted back across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlit space like nimble little ghosts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What makes you so certain," demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup abruptly, "that you are a god-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dess?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yahoya, again making herself comfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able upon her panther rug, pondered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One just knows," she explained. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">coyote knows he is not a humming-bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the horn toad knows he is not an</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How does it happen then that you dwell</seg><seg type="columnLine">with mere mortals?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I tarry with them but a little while,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">she told him thoughtfully, her eyes upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon now. "My home is yonder."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the moon, I suppose?" he bantered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," she answered seriously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," he argued, scarcely knowing why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you were born here, among these people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, no!" she smiled brightly, shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head at him. "I was not born. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived always. I just came."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then," he demanded, "how in the--</seg><seg type="columnLine">how did you get here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was a night like this one, many years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago," she explained. "The moon was big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like you see it now. I floated down through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night." She laughed reminiscently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When I appeared coming out of nothing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, singing the sacred song before Inaa,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old priest, I think he was much afraid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he knew that a goddess had come."</seg><seg type="columnLine">There could be no doubt that she believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">this rigmarole. Nor did she' seem to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">insane. If one were taken when she was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little girl, taught from the beginning that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was an immortal, she'd grow up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a young woman as Yahoya was. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old days when the divine right of kings</seg><seg type="columnLine">was undisputed the princesses must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been no little like the Yahoya type. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were only mortals!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And of course Inaa told everybody that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a goddess had come to town?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She nodded, seeing no sacrilege in North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup's way of speaking. Seeking beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystification of her "explanation" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that he saw light. Priesthood often</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough is synonymous with trickery; no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt, some years ago old Inaa had needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">or wanted to strengthen his prestige. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been, no doubt, a comparatively simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing for him to procure a pretty little girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">from some distant tribe, to bring her here</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretly and pass her off upon his credulous</seg><seg type="columnLine">people as a divinity. It was not difficult to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see how he'd strengthen his own hand in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter. It at once amused Northrup</seg><seg type="columnLine">and appealed to him as strangely pathetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the girl herself had come to believe as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others believed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose," he said, completing in words</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought which had suggested itself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, "that in due course of time Inaa will</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry you off to Tiyo, his son?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That has been his wish," she responded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And it was mine, for in holy matters Inaa</seg><seg type="columnLine">is very wise, while in other things he is stu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pid. But when the Man of Wisdom came,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw it was not for me to marry Tiyo, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And who is the Man of Wisdom?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, he is the one who teaches my peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple wonderful things! Such things as men</seg><seg type="columnLine">know out in the world of the white man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he tells Yahoya wonderful tales of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land where he will take her one day when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she marries him--of great wagons which</seg><seg type="columnLine">run uphill without horses; of wires over</seg><seg type="columnLine">which people speak across many miles; of</seg><seg type="columnLine">big waters with houses floating upon them;</seg><seg type="columnLine">of beautiful women who wear beautiful gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup started, a suspicion that at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jump was almost a certainty upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A tall man, thin faced, with drooping</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes?" he asked. "Very heavy eyebrows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming together over his nose? A way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisting his hands while he listened? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been with you about half a year?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya gazed at him in rapt admira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know everything, Yellow Beard!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I know Strang," he grunted. "And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think I know his ways. So he is going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry you, is he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes," she dimpled at him. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be nice, won't it? He is not pretty like</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Yellow Beard, but then he is prettier</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Tiyo. And he is white."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On the outside," growled Northrup.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"But do you think it is wise for an-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had started to say "an Indian girl,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thought better of it. He must try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep in mind that she was a goddess! So</seg><seg type="columnLine">he finished--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For one of your race to marry a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stared at him wonderingly a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then broke again into laughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So then Yellow Beard does not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything after all! His eyes can not see</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a piece of cotton cloth. He thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Yahoya was black like Nayangap and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tocha. Look!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE amazing maiden had suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn open a little her robe at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat, showing him the merest hint</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her round breast. And Northrup sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounded. The sun and desert air had</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked their will with her flower-like face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hands and arms, making them brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dusky. But her breast was as white</seg><seg type="columnLine">as milk!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see," she smiled quite naturally,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"goddesses are white like the women of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bahana."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!" said Northrup. And then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to speak sternly although his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a trifle uncertain, "Cover yourself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">child. You oughtn't to do things like that."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why?" she wanted to know. "Am I</seg><seg type="columnLine">not pretty?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are a madness-making little beauty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's what you are," he said in English.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And besides you are an ingenuous little</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His anger against Strang had had many</seg><seg type="columnLine">months in which to cool and it was no hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter for Northrup's generous nature to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make allowances. But suddenly the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger was flaring out hotter than ever. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no hard matter to see the situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Strang's eyes. His big hands shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly into hard fists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you love this man, this strange Ba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hana?" he asked her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yahoya's smiling lips had turned into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pout. Her quick fingers were busy gather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her gown close up about her brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat. She had expected him to be pleased</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her, and he had seemed angry. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick glance Northrup saw what she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing, glimpsed also a little gold chain</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her throat, hidden in a moment by</seg><seg type="columnLine">her cotton garment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Goddesses do not love mere men," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him loftily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nayangap and Tocha came then bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their hands broad trays upon which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">many dishes and enough food for ten men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evidently they expected that the god Si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kangwunuptu had a stomach in proportion</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his might and dignity. They set down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trays, half afraid of him and yet thrill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a little with the thought of being so</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to him. Then, at a curt nod from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their mistress, they were gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me about Strang," Northrup com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded after a sip of water and beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the piki. "Does he love you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes," Yahoya answered a little stiff-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. "All men love me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Humph! I don't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You!" widening her eyes at him after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion peculiarly her own. "But you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a man--you're just a god!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm no such thing," he said emphatic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally. "I'm a man, a white man, I hope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my name is Sax Northrup."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then," she informed him demurely, "it</seg><seg type="columnLine">may chance that after all I shall not marry</seg><seg type="columnLine">24</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Man of -Wisdom. For, though you</seg><seg type="columnLine">growl like a bear, you are so much prettier!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I want to know all about Strang," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup hurriedly. "He's been here over</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a year. Why does he stay on so long?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">She knew perfectly well how to droop her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyelids, how to flash a sidelong glance at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, how to do whatever she pleased with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her two dimples.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It may be that he has stayed because</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya lingers here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wasn't persuaded. It might be, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it didn't sound like Strang a little bit. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more Strang's way to get out of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">with both hands filled and to a place where</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man might throw his money after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of things which are to be found in cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the white men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Also," Yahoya admitted, "it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word of Inaa that the Bahana should not</seg><seg type="columnLine">go forth to tell of the People of the Hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spring. He does not go out of sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiyo or one of Tiyo's men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is a prisoner then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is held in high respect; songs are</seg><seg type="columnLine">sung for him; my people learn many things</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him. But it is death for him if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tries to go away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then," he asked her, "how does it hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pen that you count on having him show</seg><seg type="columnLine">you the wonderful things of his world when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are married?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You ask many questions, Sax North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup." She hesitated over the name, casting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two words into one and making quite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mess of it. "But if you must know, Yahoya</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Eddie have many words in private."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Eddie!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He tells me to call him that. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">nicer than Strang, and oh, so much nicer</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Saxnorthrup!" She achieved the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a little shudder and another of her sly</seg><seg type="columnLine">glances at him. "If I decide to love you I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall call you Eddie!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup passed from corn-meal soup to</seg><seg type="columnLine">melon, from melon back to corn-meal soup</seg><seg type="columnLine">without ever realizing that his manner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating was fascinating Yahoya. If Strang</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been here all this time and had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">words in private with this unsophisticated</seg><seg type="columnLine">little thing, if in all that time he had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken the trouble to enlighten her upon her</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible past history, what was the answer?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man who would leave a partner to</seg><seg type="columnLine">die alone out in the desert, robbing him of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his last drop of water, was not the man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be overscrupulous in his dealings with a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">maid. Not with a maid like Yahoya.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup looked at her sharply, seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the measure of her beauty. She looked a</seg><seg type="columnLine">being created all of soft curves, with ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der dimples set just where they would do</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most good, or the most harm, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case might be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is Strang now? Tonight?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"There is sickness in the tribe down by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corn meadows. Eddie has gone there to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive out the sickness and make people well."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Whew! So he's turned doctor, has he?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He is the Man of Wisdom. He can do</seg><seg type="columnLine">all things. He knows everything."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's certainly got a strangle-hold on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation," thought Northrup.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of a spell of moody abstraction he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was recalled to himself by the tinkle of Ya-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoya's laughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You make faces, like this," she informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, wrinkling her forehead into a frown</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thrusting her lower jaw out at him. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be that you and Eddie are not good</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't think that we are. But look</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, Yahoya, have you made up your mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you are going to marry him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes! At the end of the Festival of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Silence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What does Inaa say of it? And Tiyo?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Inaa grows very cross. And Tiyo looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Eddie like he could eat him up. Tiyo is</seg><seg type="columnLine">very sad that I don't wish to be his wife."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You told me that before. Now the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">question is, when does the Festival of Si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence end?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With the moonset.

But she looked a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled when he said shortly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're going to do nothing of the sort.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not after I have a talk with your friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eddie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YAHOYA sat very still, half in</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlight, half in shadow, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily at Northrup. He, return-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her gaze, could see that in the depths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes there was a light as of an inner fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">25</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder," she said softly, "are you Si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kangwunuptu, God of the Yellow Dawn?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or are you a mere man, Saxnorthrup?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not a question asked of him but</seg><seg type="columnLine">of herself and he made no answer.

Suddenly, with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift gracefulness which was almost like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid flowing, she was upon her feet, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms thrown out toward him as he rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you?" she cried, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was passionate earnestness throbbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">through her erect body, thrilling through</seg><seg type="columnLine">her clear voice. "You come up like a god</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a White God of the underworld! Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair is like fine threads of gold; your eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">are like such turquoises as they do not find</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more in the world, such turquoises as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haruing Wuhti wears upon her throat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms when the Sun God conies to see how</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful she is. Your skin where the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">has not blackened it is white like goat's</seg><seg type="columnLine">milk, white and soft like Yahoya's own!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why do you come?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She broke off suddenly. He could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">her breathing. Then, before he could an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer, she had gone on impetuously, drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping her arms, moving a little closer to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you come seeking a maiden, Yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beard? Ishohil There is no mana here so</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful as I! Look! Do you come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make my heart leap out of my side for you?</seg><seg type="columnLine">It has leaped, quick, without waiting, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white antelope leaps up when he sees</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wolf. If you come seeking a maiden</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, Yellow Beard, here am I, Yahoya,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maiden and goddess, who will follow you</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the desert if you will, or down into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">underworld."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stood so close to him now that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost as if he had obeyed the wild im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulse upon him and was holding her in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms. For an instant he felt that one must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be more than man or less than man not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">yield to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But his arms, lifting a little, fell again to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sides. He had one code, had Sax North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup, and many hard years of seeking to live</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to it had made him the man he was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Accept the chances which the game of life</seg><seg type="columnLine">presents, but play the game square!" If</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever there was call upon him for fair play</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yahoya!" He sought to speak sternly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his voice was uncertain, catching a lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle in his throat. "There is moon-madness</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">upon you. You don't know what it is you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are saying."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked at him with a curious smile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which were oddly mingled wonder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Must Yahoya twist her lips into lies</seg><seg type="columnLine">when her lover comes?" she asked softly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Must she hide her heart because it loves</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Yellow Beard?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are talking nonsense," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">harshly. "You don't love me and there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">no reason why you should. Love doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">come this way, in a hurry. Just because</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are used to Indians about you and I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">am the first white man-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You forget Eddie," she dimpled at him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still confident and undisturbed by his words.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I did not love Eddie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank God for that! But that's no rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son you should think you love me. Nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">any reason that I should love you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed at his earnestness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your Ups lie well for you, Saxnorthrup.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But in your eyes I saw the truth before you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hid it. When you lifted your arms a little,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">like this-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Already did Northrup, thinking of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming dawn, foresee complication enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">without this. Feeling that he must settle</seg><seg type="columnLine">this matter while the strength of will was</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him, he said in well simulated anger:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yahoya, listen to me. I did not come</seg><seg type="columnLine">here seeking a maiden. I came looking for</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold and turquoises. I have need of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not of a mana. You do not love me and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not love you. Do you understand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He marveled at the lightning - swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">changes which seemed so natural to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl. In a flash the erect body had grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigid, the laughing mouth hardened cruelly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark eyes were flashing at him as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen them flash at old Inaa in a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of anger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So," she said, and her voice was steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">and low, but as hard as flint. "So you</seg><seg type="columnLine">come but to make mock of me? Is that it?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I offer you my love and you push it aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">to seize upon gold and cold stones! You</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare--you dare make light of Yahoya's</seg><seg type="columnLine">love?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup watched her, uncertain of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer to make.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you are a god," she said in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold voice, "I, too, am a goddess; then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time will come when I shall learn how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make you twist your great body in suffer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.

"You might</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill a lizard with it; nothing more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment she seemed to hesitate, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly earnest, filled with assurance that</seg><seg type="columnLine">her curse would annihilate him. Then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped the baho to the grass again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think," she said quietly, "that I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait until the dawn. That then I shall call</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tiyo and the others at my command</seg><seg type="columnLine">will hurl you out from the rocks. And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall laugh at you while you die horribly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yellow Beard!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll plug a dozen of them full of holes</seg><seg type="columnLine">first," grunted Northrup, a real anger be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning to grow within him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> God knew he was but seeking to befriend</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and that she needed a man to lift a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curse from her. And all that he was getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">by way of reward was a threat of death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yahoya," he said after the flash of an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger, forcing himself to a sane line of thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I want to tell you something. Will you</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen to me and try to understand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he was the one supplicating; now</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a note of eager pleading in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice and she was the one who could deny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yahoya has wasted enough time amus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing herself with a new plaything," she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her quaint little queenly air. "Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">she must go and prepare for the bridal cere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mony."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She took a step to pass him, but North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup set himself stubbornly in her path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand aside!" she commanded him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Or shall I call for Tiyo and his men?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What are you going to do?" he demand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed. "Are you going on with this mad wed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ding?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At the dawn," she informed him coolly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yahoya will become the bride of the Man</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Wisdom. After that she will do what</seg><seg type="columnLine">she likes. It may be that she will have Tiyo</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw Eddie down the cliffs; it may be that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she will become a bride again to Tiyo; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be that she will have Tiyo throw Yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low Beard down to join the other Bahana!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whatever the Goddess Yahoya wishes done,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that thing will be done. And now, will you</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand aside for me to pass?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" snapped Northrup. "You are go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to listen to me if I have to hold you</seg><seg type="columnLine">while you do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You would lay your hand on Yahoya?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The wonder at him stood high in her eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but back of it was a quick look of admira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Certainly this man dared much.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll take you across my knee and spank</seg><seg type="columnLine">you in a minute!" he told her in mystifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">English.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are those magic words, Yellow Beard?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she asked quite seriously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup grinned a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are very magic words, sometimes,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told her. "They have been known to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work wonders with little girls who didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind properly. I want to talk with you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">about you, Yahoya. Before it is too late."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps it was his earnestness which held</seg><seg type="columnLine">her; perhaps just the curiosity to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it was he had to say of her. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned back, again making herself comfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able upon her rug.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," and it was with a sigh of relief</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he began, "I want you to tell me again</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your coming here. Did Inaa, by any</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance, save any of the garments which</seg><seg type="columnLine">you wore?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I came down from the emptiness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">night," she told him. "My robe was built</seg><seg type="columnLine">of moonlight and mist."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a wonder you didn't catch cold,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he grinned at her, and he thought that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to fight back an answering smile. "So</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing that you wore has been saved?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This only," and her fingers at her throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed him a glimpse of the gold chain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This came with me from the moon and is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a magic thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He put out his hand eagerly for it. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be that after all she had carried with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her through the years a locket which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">establish her identity--if he could ever get</seg><seg type="columnLine">her out of this!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me look at it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shook her head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It has never left my throat but the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for a goldsmith to lengthen it. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">take it off would bring evil. But since you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are curious, Saxnorthrup, and since it may</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen that you will die in a few hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you may come close and look."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup bent over her, drawing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chain out from under her robe. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender chain hung a little locket, plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold. He found the spring, the locket flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">open. Within was the picture of a young</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman who, in this light, might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya herself. Opposite the picture were</seg><seg type="columnLine">some two or three words engraved, a full</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">27</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">name he hoped. But he could not make</seg><seg type="columnLine">them out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, this was something. If he ever got</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and got Yahoya away with him, he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">never rest until he could tell her who she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About the time that you came here,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked, "do you remember that the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a white man or woman was found any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where in the desert? Where they had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, starving, dying of thirst or a rattle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake bite? And quite near the spot where</seg><seg type="columnLine">you appeared before Inaa?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," she answered, obviously puzzled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why do you ask that, Yellow Beard?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is the thing which I wanted to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Yahoya."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There he stopped hesitantly, trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see just how to go about telling a goddess</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was just a girl in spite of her many</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of belief to the contrary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A good many years ago," he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, "some people, a man and a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a little girl, perhaps, sought to cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desert. God knows what drove them</seg><seg type="columnLine">or lured them. We may never know that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya, or it may be that we shall find</seg><seg type="columnLine">out sometime. At any rate, just before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came this far, they died. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">their water gave out. The man would try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to save his water for the woman; she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">let her little girl drink and go thirsty her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. So it might happen that both man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and woman would die and the little girl live."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He paused again, looking at her to see if</seg><seg type="columnLine">she began to understand. She was looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him intently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on," she commanded. "The little</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, what became of her?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They were white people, Yahoya. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">little girl was too little to understand all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had happened. Maybe her mother,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying, or her father, told her to go on to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the cliffs where they had thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw a man. The man they saw was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inaa, and the little white girl was--you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time she sat still and silent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring at him in sheer wonder. Yahoya</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a goddess! Yahoya a white girl, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter of a white man and woman who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had perished miserably on the desert!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup, seeing the rise and fall of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast in the moonlight, the look which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had crept into her wide eyes, wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">what tumult of thoughts had seethed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">her brain at his words. It did not enter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind that she would not believe him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he had not counted sufficiently upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">what a dozen years of training had done for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. She had been very, very little when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had come to the People of the Hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spring. Inaa had told her that she was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">goddess and had bade his people worship her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had heard over and over and over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tale of her coming down through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night from her distant home in the moon;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tale, oft repeated, had grown into fact.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She did not remember her father and moth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er dying of thirst; she thought that she did</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember her floating down to earth among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stars w'hich worshiped her as she went</seg><seg type="columnLine">by. She had been reared to a belief, a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligion, which never a doubt had assailed. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence like hers was not to be shaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the words of the first man who said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are no goddess, but a mortal Ba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hana!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you dare say to me, Yellow Beard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Yahoya is no true goddess but an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">postor? Is that it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What I have to say is that old Inaa is a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">- scoundrel who has used you for his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">own purposes," muttered Northrup. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are a girl, just a girl, and God knows there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is nothing more wonderful than that in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. A girl to whom the going back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world of her kind will be nothing short</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dipping into fairyland."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yahoya's sudden laughter surprised him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fool!" she called him. "Fool and liar!</seg><seg type="columnLine">To think that I would believe such wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">tales. It would be well if you remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you are but a Bahana, Saxnorthrup,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I am Yahoya."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he put out no hand now to stop her</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she went swiftly toward the stone edifice</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the overhanging cliffs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's a pretty game for a man to play</seg><seg type="columnLine">out," he grunted when she was gone. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">she were just plain girl things would be bad</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">enough. But being a goddess to boot-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here he broke off. Yahoya had left her</seg><seg type="columnLine">panther-skin behind her. Northrup rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in it and went to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN SPITE of the fatigue resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a dead weight upon him North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup dozed more than slept that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, waking often. His destiny had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought to him a responsibility which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted unqucstioningly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">28</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole future life and happiness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an extremely unsophisticated girl was upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulders and if he played the game fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had her hand as well as his own to play.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These thoughts alone were sufficient to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain him from yielding to heavy sleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, allied with them, was the feeling that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his new acquaintance, Tiyo, might not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">averse to creeping up upon him and driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">a knife into him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the night he gained the impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion that Yahoya had not gone to bed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now and then a light moved across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of her stone habitation; once or twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought that he heard her voice giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">commands to her attendant maidens. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was certain that it was her laugh, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefree as if she had never known a shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trouble or anxiety in her life, that woke</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moon had long passed the zenith</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from bright silver had turned to a milky</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiteness when he started up to a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound. Since coming to this strange place</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had heard no voice save his own and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya's; she herself had told him that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one would dare speak until she had stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">out upon the cliff's edge and sung the sa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cred song. But now from the stone house</seg><seg type="columnLine">came not only her voice but the low rum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble of a man's utterance. And the tone was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard, menacing, oddly unpleasant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup got to his feet, stretching his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body to get the stiffness out of it. He took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun out of its holster and examined it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be sure that the clip was full, that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be relied upon in case of need. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">first thought was that the voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strang's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will be dawn in an hour," he thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I wonder what the new day is bringing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went to the western edge of the cliffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked down. There was the head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters of the tribe. He could see ledges</seg><seg type="columnLine">and steps cut into the face of the precipice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make out countless orifices, rudely cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cular, which no doubt led into intricate</seg><seg type="columnLine">passageways and numerous small chambers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He noted swiftly that the stairways and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledges seemed alive with figures of men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">women and children, and that in long</seg><seg type="columnLine">streams they were moving downward into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canon below. Down there were many</seg><seg type="columnLine">other figures, clustering in groups where</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fires burned. Northrup saw with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">frown what they were doing. Everywhere</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were great jugs, and from jug to jug the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were passing, drinking. He saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of them walked with the unsteady</seg><seg type="columnLine">step of drunkenness. And all in silence--</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence, absolute, unbroken by so much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whisper; silence hovering over a drunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">carousal!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When they start things going," he mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, "where is it going to end?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yahoya's face, the clear-eyed, frank, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuous face of a girl who should be wear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her first party gown, flushed with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumph of her first season, rose before him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If she had only realized the horror of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">position in which she stood it seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup that the situation would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a shade less terrible. But her calm</seg><seg type="columnLine">serenity in the face of all that encompassed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, her dimpling assurance that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Goddess Yahoya, only to be adored and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to be harmed, made him feel toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">her as he might have felt toward a child</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooing its happiness over a new discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it crept toward a rattlesnake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shuddered at the thought and, turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing away from the silent orgy below, went</seg><seg type="columnLine">with guarded steps toward the stone build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The low rumble of the man's voice, rasp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing impatiently now, was not Strang's voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup realized that before he had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten steps. He moved on quietly, coming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked into the one large room which</seg><seg type="columnLine">constituted the greater part of the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing's interior; saw that upon each side a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller door led into what was apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely an anteroom of some sort; saw Ya-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoya, her two maidens and the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was speaking swiftly. The man was Inaa,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old priest. His attitude was plainly one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dominance and threat now; Yahoya's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were filled with amazement. North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup guessed quickly that never had a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken to her like this before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So intent were the four upon what Inaa</seg><seg type="columnLine">was saying that none of them noted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall form in the shadow outside. Yahoya</seg><seg type="columnLine">was seated upon some sort of chair over</seg><seg type="columnLine">which a robe of white skins had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long moment Northrup's eyes clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her, wonderingly. Until now he had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been struck with the full measure of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty. Now was there excuse enough for</seg><seg type="columnLine">superstitious minds to believe her what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed herself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Y ahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">29</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There were a score of little lamps in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, set in niches or upon squared stones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cotton wicks soaked in oil shedding a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright, soft light. Northrup saw that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's eyes were not black but a deep, fath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">omless gray; that her hair was not the night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">black hair of Nayangap and Tocha but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich, sun-kissed brown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hair was arranged as the native</seg><seg type="columnLine">brides wear it, in two great whorls, one at</seg><seg type="columnLine">each ear, held back from the forehead by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad band of gold above the brows. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">great turquoise, catching many lights from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lamps, shone from the middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden band.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cotton gown of the early evening to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether with the broad blue sash had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">discarded for the bridal gown. This was of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some stuff which could not be but which</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked the finest silk, snow-white, a cling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing garment which fitted the tender form</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly, which left the arms bare, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed a glimpse of the whiteness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The band about her slim waist was a gir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle of gold, beaten into little squares joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">cunningly, each adorned with a pendent</seg><seg type="columnLine">turquoise. Her feet, encased in snow-white</seg><seg type="columnLine">buckskin moccasins, were crossed before</seg><seg type="columnLine">her upon the loose folds of the white robe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nayangap and Tocha stood one at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of their mistress, their black eyes wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">and startled, their lips parted, a look of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear upon each face. Inaa's back was to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward Northrup. The old man's form was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense, his voice vibrant with the emotion</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is death to break silence during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Festival of Silence," Yahoya was saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">now quite calmly, a little curl of contempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching her mouth. "You will go down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Skeleton House, Inaa, before the day is</seg><seg type="columnLine">born and dies again!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Inaa's grunt was eloquent of his defiance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Will you not let the maidens go, oh, Ya-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoya?" he demanded in a tone which told</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the same demand before had met with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her refusal. "The thing which I have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, for which I have dared break silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the time, is not for them to hear."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I have told you," she answered him</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily, "that it is my will that my maid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ens stay with me. Surely with old age mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness has come upon you! You are great</seg><seg type="columnLine">among your people, Inaa, but do you for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">get that you are only an old man, soon to</seg><seg type="columnLine">die? The Skeleton Old Man has one hand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">upon your beard now! Be careful what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you say, how you speak to Yahoya!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again Inaa's grunt, making Northrup</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaguely uneasy. The old man was unmoved</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Yahoya's words, and his attitude was</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly untinged by respect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let the maids stay," he said gruffly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It matters not. If," and as he turned a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little Northrup could see the evil glance he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot at them, making them cringe back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it, "if they speak later of what hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pens here tonight they will go at once and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all time to a lover who has cold arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lies in darkness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused a moment, staring from under</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gathered brows at Yahoya. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke swiftly, his voice lowered, unspeak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably stern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There is little time, for what I have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say must be finished before the first dawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes. Yahoya, at dawn you will sing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacred song?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will the sun rise?" she mocked him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And afterward," he retorted, "you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">wed?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think," she answered, her tone</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with sarcasm, "that Yahoya can find</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man among all these men who will wed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with so ugly a mana?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You think that you will put out your</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and that the Man of Wisdom will</seg><seg type="columnLine">come? You will wed him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Oho!" she laughed, leaning a little for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, her mocking eyes upon the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest's. "And are you jealous, Inaa? With</seg><seg type="columnLine">madness has youth run back into your cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood, making it hot again? Do you covet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And again she flung her laughter at him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing with him, finding vent for the an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger which he had whipped up in her. Inaa</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted his hand as if to stop her. And Ya-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoya's laughter taunted him until she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It is my desire," he said angrily, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you wed one of my own people. It is my</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire, Yahoya, that you wed Tiyo, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. It is also his desire. And," the words</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming coldly, "it is my command!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SLOWLY Yahoya's face went</seg><seg type="columnLine">white. She did not move but seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed for a long moment a statue ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be wakened into life but as yet cold mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the blood sprang back into her</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks, racing hotly through her veins, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">30</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">red tide of anger. Northrup drew a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath and stared at her fascinated, forget-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful for the instant of Inaa. The girl stirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little where she sat, then grew still, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">her quick breathing and flashing eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the color in her cheeks hinting at the tu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mult in her breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The others are drinking in the canon,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said coolly. "Have you too drunk deep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, Inaa? Or are you eager to have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vengeance of Yahoya strike?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fool!" snarled Inaa. "Must I, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old man, be afraid of you, a soft-bodied</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl? For the thing I have to tell you, Ya-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoya, is that you are a girl and no goddess;</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a girl as Nayangap there and Tocha,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but with the white body of the Ba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hana."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup felt that he could have patted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old villain on the back for that. For, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything were to be done for her, the soon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er Yahoya got her ideas of her own divinity</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of her head, the better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A girl, a girl with white skin, but just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl," he gibed, mocking her as she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">mocked him. "A girl I put where she is; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl I can pull down and give to the village</seg><seg type="columnLine">to play with when I wish. Would you like,</seg><seg type="columnLine">oh, dainty Yahoya, to have the hard hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of many drunken men pull you this way</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that? Or would you like to obey the</seg><seg type="columnLine">command of Inaa and wed Tiyo--and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain to the people what Inaa made you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a goddess? You must decide swiftly, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dawn is coming and does not wait, Ya-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoya, because a white maid bids it to!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nayangap and Tocha gasped, turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bewildered eyes from their mistress to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old priest, back to where Yahoya sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly now Yahoya stirred, her gaze go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to Nayangap, then to Tocha.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have heard Inaa speak," she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">very quietly. "You have seen one high in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thoughts of the gods stricken with mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. In a little those gods will gather him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them, Nayangap and Tocha. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">will see; his death has left the underworld</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring him thither. And harken well--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">her voice rising a little--"you maidens who</seg><seg type="columnLine">have heard must forget that you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard! I have commanded, I, Yahoya!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even yet she did not believe. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men had told her, first Northrup, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed her one of his own blood, next Inaa,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who told her of his own trickery, Yahoya</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not believe. Too deeply had the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">training of a lifetime sunken into her mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be wiped out in an instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inaa's rage, curbed until now, burst its</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonds. With black, distorted face, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands thrown out like claws of a beast, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped at her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Goddess, are you, Yahoya?" he snarled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her. "Inaa will teach wisdom to a white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodied fool! If you are goddess and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">maid then may you fling an old man away</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no effort."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup, unprepared for the sudden at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack, saw Yahoya dragged from her seat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged down so that she was upon her</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees, the priest's hands at her throat. Ya-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoya struggled, but his strength in his rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ten times the strength of a girl, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not so much as cry out. Her two</seg><seg type="columnLine">maids stood transfixed with horror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was but an instant. Northrup, gather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his strength in a sudden flare of anger</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely less than the frenzy of Inaa, threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself upon the old man, gripped his wrists</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ripped them away, flinging Inaa far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him so that he staggered across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and struck the far wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You infernal cur!" cried the white man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned away from the blinking, evil</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes to where Yahoya, white-faced and</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting, was staring at them like one rudely</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaked from a nightmare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why won't you believe?" he asked her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply. "It is almost the dawn; your</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole life is in your hands now for a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes. Why spoil it with an insane idea?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Can't you see that you are just a girl, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">says? My God! Won't you see it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the girl's eyes were so many emotions</seg><seg type="columnLine">striving for mastery over her that North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup could not guess what passed in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. She opened her lips but did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak. He had felt a little spurt of anger</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her, too, that she let her stubbornness lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the way of her welfare. Now he felt only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deep pity for her. In a rude moment he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Inaa had tried to wrest from under her</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet the whole belief of her life. Small won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der that she stared at them like that!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yahoya," he went on gently, "can't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand it?

Northrup swung about, seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inaa. The old man had slipped away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">|||||j|| "GO TO your mistress!"

Yahoya must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to think before he tried further to talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her. And he himself wanted to think.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inaa, none too sweet-tempered an old ras-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal at the best, would be up to mischief now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His anger would include Northrup as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya. It would be just as well to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">for nearly anything now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he had not looked for what had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready begun. His eyes, seeking Inaa, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone naturally to the far edge of the cliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the steps of stone led down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canon where the tribe was drinking. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not see Inaa, but saw a head rising as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man climbed upward. At first he had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion who the man was, as Strang had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone from his mind, and this was not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strang he had known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strang's breast showed as he came up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, from the base of the cliff what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked a shadow there resolved itself in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a man's form, leaping out upon Strang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The moonlight fell upon the fellow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed Northrup Tiyo's dark face, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth showing, the eyes gleaming murder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously. The knife which already had threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened Northrup was flung up above Strang's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two white men must have seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian at the same moment. Simultane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously their quick cries shot through the still-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. Strang leaped up the last of the steps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing himself to the side as Tiyo came</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him. He had had but the instant to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cide and had decided upon taking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance here upon the level rather than seek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to descend a hazardous way, leaving his</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy over him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Tiyo had had time to plan for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. As Strang turned to the side the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian sprang upon him. Northrup saw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the moonlight gleam on the uplifted blade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the little grunt with which Tiyo</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought it down, heard the thud of the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pact and for the second thought that all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strang's accounts were squared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, gripping his automatic, having no</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to shoot from here, he ran to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two forms which were rolling close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">precipice. As he leaped forward, Yahoya,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having heard the cries, came running by</seg><seg type="columnLine">her maidens to stand in the doorway, watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tiyo's knife had drunk blood, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the body of the writhing man, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a sheath only in the outflung fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm. Now Strang, a tall man, made into</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron from his months on the desert, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting as a maddened animal fights for its</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. His hand had grown into a steel band</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Tiyo's wrist, was forcing the knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">back from him. And still, like two great</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting cats, the two men now were almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the edge of nothingness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Indian, seeing a chance, dropped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife so that it fell against the rock floor at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his left side. As quick as lightning he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept it up again in his left hand, had whip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped it up so that again it caught the moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. And then Northrup, throwing him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self forward, was in time. His great fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers shut about the Indian's left wrist, grip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping it as Strang gripped the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment of breathless struggle in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the muscles of the three men stood out</seg><seg type="columnLine">mightily. Then the three bodies relaxed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knife came away in Northrup's hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Strang and Tiyo, rolling over swiftly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to their feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well done, Yellow Beard!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yahoya's young voice came ringing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them; Yahoya herself had come quickly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup's side, looking up into his face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And again the man saw in the woman's face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unhidden, the admiration which looked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him frankly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond the emotion which he had arous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed in her she seemed unmoved by what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen. She was laughing softly when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is in Yahoya's heart to make you love</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, Saxnorthrup."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strang whirled about suddenly. Until</seg><seg type="columnLine">now his watchful eyes had been for Tiyo</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. The name, even as Yahoya pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced it, brought him peering into North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Northrup!" There was almost a gasp</seg><seg type="columnLine">32</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of fear in the voice. "You--you didn't die</seg><seg type="columnLine">then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think not," Northrup assured him</seg><seg type="columnLine">coolly. "Otherwise I should not have had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the privilege of saving you a throat-cut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "- him!" spat out Strang, his eyes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">again going to the Indian. "I'll get him for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tiyo's face, a moment ago a picture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hot rage and hatred within him, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed nothing. With an elaborate as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumption of nonchalance, he lifted his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders and turned to go down the steps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup, watching him go, noted that not</seg><seg type="columnLine">once had the man spoken, that now his lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">were sealed. The suspicion came to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Tiyo, like the rest of his simple people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been tricked by the old priest into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainty that Yahoya was a goddess and</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not dare speak until she, singing the sa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cred song, had given the signal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you are alive?" demanded Strang as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he could not be convinced. "And you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have got here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was frowning, his eyes deeply thought-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful. He seemed already to have forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiyo and that but for Northrup's coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiyo's knife would have drunk more deep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. There was no gratitude in his sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance; but there was displeasure and sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picion. As quick as a flash his eyes went</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Northrup to Yahoya's face where a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man must read what she did not seek to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Curse it!" cried Strang. "Haven't I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough on my hands already? What the</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil do you want here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup grunted his disgust of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the first place," he said coolly, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want a talk with you. And I want it right</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, before daybreak. If you've got a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shred of decency in you, if you've got a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop of sporting blood, which I don't be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve you have, I have a proposition to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STRANG, gripping his wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm as he followed, they went back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Yahoya's house. For North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup wanted what privacy there was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">had. And he wanted what light he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have upon Strang's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yahoya, unbidden but frankly interested,</seg><seg type="columnLine">went with them. As they began speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a language which was unknown to her,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">she frowned a little and watched them the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more closely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's a girl who's in a nasty mess,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup began abruptly. "She's white</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she's the plaything of a dirty old sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age. We've got to get her out of this. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sight more than a one - man job or I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't ask your help. The mere fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there is no love between you and me</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't cut any figure in a case like this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Will you tuck in and help me get her out?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strang's head was down as he sought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bind up his wound. When he looked up it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was first at Yahoya. He studied her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">intently, then turned to Northrup. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Northrup he demanded sharply:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you talked with her? Do you un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand their lingo?"	&gt;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What have you told her? Does she</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that the goddess stuff is all bunk?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have told her. But she doesn't believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Inaa told her and she thought that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lying."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a gleam in Strang's eye which</seg><seg type="columnLine">told Northrup what he might expect even</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Strang's voice demanded bluntly:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well? If she wants to believe it, what's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the difference?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What difference?" cried Northrup hot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. "We've got to get her out, I tell you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And it looks as if we'd have to go on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">run. Unless she gets that fool notion out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her head, I've got my doubts if she'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to go with us and leave what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks upon as her people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strang's brows contracted into a quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">frown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know your sort pretty well, Sax North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup," he said sharply. "You're the kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who likes to run things pretty much</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his own way and to - with the other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow. Here you butt in where I've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">six months and at the jump are telling me</seg><seg type="columnLine">what 'we' are going to do! Hasn't it en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered your head that perhaps I've decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">for myself what I am going to do? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">what this girl is going to do? And, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heaven! You can put it in your pipe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke it right now that she is going to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I tell her to do!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup bit back the words which came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his lips. Now was no time to quarrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Strang. And, since no human being is</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether vicious, he still hoped to find a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hint of decency somewhere in Strang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Would you mind telling me what your</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">33</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">plans are?" he asked quietly. "Things are</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to happen pretty fast now, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little color came into Strang's bronzed</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks, a quick bright light like a flame into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you'll listen to reason, will you?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded, making the mistake of thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself the bigger man at that moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You can just bet things are going to hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pen in a hurry. I'm going to get Tiyo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tag to begin with, the murderous young</seg><seg type="columnLine">hound! And I'm going to put a crimp into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inaa's game that will make him dizzy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, so that you won't make any mistakes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup, I'll tell you right now who's run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nin' the whole show here. It's Ed Strang!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What I've got I'm going to hold on to; what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I haven't got--I'm going to get. And I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to keep it--just as long as I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes went swiftly to the splendid</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of Yahoya, clung there a moment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, defiantly, came back to Northrup.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are just one man against a whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe," Northrup reminded him, keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">the anger out of his voice though for an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant his eyes were on fire with it. "Has it</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred to you that they will let you go</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as far as it pleases them? And that</seg><seg type="columnLine">then they will know how to bring you up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a rather ugly jerk?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strang's air while he was speaking had</seg><seg type="columnLine">subtly changed. Now, if in truth he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the master of the situation, he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was. From confidence he went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">insolence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've been here six months, you've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">here a few hours, and so you advise and</seg><seg type="columnLine">warn," he laughed impudently. "And, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you want to know, I am not one man against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tribe. The tribe is split square in two, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">by-! I'm the man that split it! Inaa is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">going down to make room for another man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who's hungering after his job. Tiyo is go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the same way to make place for a sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tribal captain who belongs to me. Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you begin to see, Sax Northrup?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup saw, knew that Strang was tell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him the truth, and understood that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sober truth Strang might have made him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self the power to reckon with here. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It won't work," he said quietly. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't get away with it, Strang, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to know it. You might put it over</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a while, but the bottom will drop out of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole thing sooner or later. And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think it will be sooner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will, will it? You wouldn't mind ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaining how and why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because where one white man has gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">another follows. Where two have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">many will come. If I don't take this girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with me I'll come back for her. And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't come alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again Strang's assurance rang in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Has the thought occurred to you that</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe you won't go out at all?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup stared at him incredulously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strang had risen, or fallen, to levels North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup had not thought open to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Frankly, it hadn't. I generally go where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want to go. While we are threshing things</seg><seg type="columnLine">out you might tell me what you are driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">at."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm driving at this: I've stumbled on</seg><seg type="columnLine">to something here which, if I work it the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one right way, will put me in a place where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can make the Astors and Morgans shine</seg><seg type="columnLine">my shoes. If I let you go your way out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to blab, I stand to lose the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. So you are not going to get out! Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that plain enough?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're taking over a pretty big con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tract, aren't you?" asked Northrup stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily. "I don't see how you're going to pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent me going out, unless you get some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your friends to stick a knife into me. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">you won't do that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you know I won't?" snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because you haven't got the nerve," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torted Northrup. "I know your kind, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You'd go off and leave a man to die alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the desert, because you're an infernal</seg><seg type="columnLine">coward! Too much of a coward to kill a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man or to make somebody else do it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're short on nerve, Strang."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strang's lips twitched a little, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes held hard to Northrup's, and the cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare in them. After a brief, hesitant mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment he whirled about and went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. Yahoya, who had guessed what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">might of the conversation, flashed a quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance at Northrup and smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost immediately Strang came back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He pointed outside. Northrup, looking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw six men, one after the other, come si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lently up from, the canon. He noted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, excepting one only, were tall, sinewy</seg><seg type="columnLine">young men of superb physiques, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were fully armed, each carrying two</seg><seg type="columnLine">34</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">great-bladed knives at his belt, and in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand a short thrusting-spear. The one man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had passed the prime of life looked a</seg><seg type="columnLine">patriarch. Hair and beard were snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">white; he was great-framed and erect; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes flashed as if with youth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Inaa's successor," said Strang, taking on</seg><seg type="columnLine">again his marked manner of one supreme in</seg><seg type="columnLine">power. "And the first of the young men is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muyingwa who is hungering after Tiyo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">job. They are friends of mine, as you call</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, Northrup. Don't forget that. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are more of them coming."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I can drop the whole gang in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks if need be before they can get within</seg><seg type="columnLine">knifing distance," answered Northrup, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstanding what lay back of Strang's air</seg><seg type="columnLine">of authority.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And in the end get a two-edged knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">through you," came the swift answer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You know that. You wouldn't have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance in the world. If you did getaway</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the minute, what would you do? Run</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the desert without taking time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a drink of water, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go ahead, Strang. You haven't entire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly outlined your plan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you're ready-to walk easy and talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">easier, are you?" sneered Strang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still standing at the door he flung out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand a trifle theatrically. The six men stop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped dead in their tracks. He turned a smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Northrup.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see? Now maybe you'll listen. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't got anything against you, North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup, and I'd let you go and be glad of it if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could. But I tell you I can't work this</seg><seg type="columnLine">game in a day. It's too big; the stakes--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you I can make the big men on Wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street look sick! If I took a chance on you</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you squealed when you got out, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">what? I can't do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's about enough sop to your con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">science," cut in Northrup. "What do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think you are going to do with me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to keep you here until I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">get out. I need a man like you. There are</seg><seg type="columnLine">mines here, gold-mines--it makes me dizzy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think about it--which these fool Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">have never worked beyond scratching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top like a flock of clucking hens! You are</seg><seg type="columnLine">going into the mines; you are going to drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men I give you and drive them hard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You are going to clean up more money for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me than you ever saw. And when I get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away and it goes with me, then you can do</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you-please!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Many thanks," said Northrup dryly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It doesn't sound good to me, Strang."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Strang could answer, the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian whom he had made known as Muy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingwa came on, leaving his fellows. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his hand in salute twice, first to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strang, second to Yahoya.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes ran by them all, flashed a greet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing which was filled with triumph at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl Nayangap, standing in the ante-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room door. Then, his eyes upon Strang, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted his hand and pointed toward the east.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the first light of the dawn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup swung about toward Yahoya.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yahoya," he said quickly, "you must</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I listen, Yellow Beard," she said, look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at him curiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you want to talk to her about?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded Strang in sharp suspicion. "Keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">your hands off, Sax Northrup. She's mine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you will do well to keep it in mind."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yours? You contemptible coward!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup flung at him, his anger at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapping its leash. "You would trade on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her superstition and ignorance and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw her away when you got tired, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">you? Now I am going to talk with her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are going outside while I do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Am I?" jeered Strang. "So you've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">a notion to the pretty innocent yourself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you? If you think I've kept my hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">off her this long just so you can have</seg><seg type="columnLine">her-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup shut Strang's mouth with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow which brought the blood and sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strang reeling out through the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come in and I'll kill you," he said, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice dropped low and grown husky. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean that, Strang."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strang hesitated, then went swiftly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muyingwa and the others who had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer. Northrup paid no further attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him save always to keep him in sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yahoya," he said as gently as he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the emotions riding him. "You must</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe me. You are a girl, a Bahana like</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Inaa has tricked you. Strang knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Strang is a bad man in a good many</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways, Yahoya. I'd rather see you marry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiyo than him. Tiyo at least loves you, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think. Strang plans on getting rid of Tiyo</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Inaa, on putting two other men in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">places--that old man out there and Muy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingwa. Then Strang will be chief man here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he will do what he pleases with you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do you understand, Yahoya?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I understand," she said curiously, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you say I am no true goddess but a mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, like Nayangap and Tocha there, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">white. Why do you lie to me, Yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beard?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lie to you?" he cried. "Can't you see</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's the truth. Cut your hand and it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleed; put it in the fire and the fire will</seg><seg type="columnLine">burn it; go without food and water and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will die like the rest of us! Can't you see?</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're just a God-blessed girl, Yahoya, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">no goddess."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shook her head, the odd smile still in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The dawn is coming, Yellow Beard," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said softly. "I must go. The people wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Yahoya."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," he cried after her, "you must not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">marry Strang-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Goddess Yahoya promised," she told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him steadily. "A goddess must not lie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOT the most patient of men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup was tempted to express</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in very strong words and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">inform Miss Yahoya that from now on she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do as she pleased for all of him, either</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to Strang or the devil and be done with</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Nor did the smile which she turned on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strang as she went by him soften North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup's mood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have broken the sacred silence, O Ya-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoya, goddess!" Strang was scarcely more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than whispering and yet Northrup's eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears caught the words clearly enough. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was because harm was threatened you</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I feared for you. Am I forgiven?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Am I true goddess, then, Eddie?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The white man in yonder says you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">not," he answered quickly, his eyes watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful of her slightest change of expression.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He is a liar. Inaa says you are not; he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a false priest, bewitched. They shall both</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffer for it, Yahoya. Tiyo denies your</seg><seg type="columnLine">godliness. He too shall suffer. Shall they</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, Yahoya?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take them when you will!" she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes flaming; and so she passed on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup shrugged his shoulders. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">told himself that he had done his best and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he were a mad fool to attempt any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing further in the face of what confront-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed him. But since madness had the way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">galloping down his blood when crises came,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he was by no means sure what the ending</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be. He knew that he would watch;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if Strang or his crowd sought to lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands on one Sax Northrup, there was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a fight worth a man's while.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Yahoya, walking erect and swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the level space, came to the cliff's</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge, Strang, followed by the old patriarch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">al figure, Muyingwa and the other young</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, went close behind her. Northrup</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted the glance which passed between</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muyingwa and the girl, Nayangap, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance easily understood since there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not much difference between it and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance which might pass between two young</seg><seg type="columnLine">people in a box at the opera. Then North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup strode out after the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If there was to be a fight it was well to</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan a bit while there was time. He forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind to this now and away from Ya-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoya.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw that the Indians, heavily armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they were, might be held off by a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an automatic and plenty of ammuni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. He saw that if Strang carried a gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was hidden about his clothes. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not believe that Strang had any sort of fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm upon him. It would have been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural thing for the man's hand to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone its way to his hip when Northrup had</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck him in the mouth; and he had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no such gesture. There were a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways in which a man, out on the desert for</seg><seg type="columnLine">months, might have lost his weapon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I'm the only man here with a gun,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">pondered Northrup, "they'll have their</seg><seg type="columnLine">work cut out for them if they start any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could withdraw toward the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps, up which he had come from the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">canon. In the narrow passageway he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold them back while he swept up the jug</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water. After that, what was to be would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dawn had come at last. Yahoya,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing upon the brink of the precipice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood very still, her head thrown back a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little, her eyes upon the pale moon, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms lifted. Northrup came closer to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge and looked down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dark forms there were quiet, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown as motionless as Yahoya's own. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole tribe gathered there stood with lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, with faces turned up. Now and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a form stirred Northrup could see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a stagger of drunkenness, could guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the stuff which they had been drinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">36</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was the terribly intoxicating juice of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">agave, which, fermented in rawhide bags,</seg><seg type="columnLine">puts frenzy into men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly through the silence floated Ya-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoya's voice, singing softly. She was chant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the sacred song, the song which people</seg><seg type="columnLine">said she was singing when she appeared be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore Inaa out of the night. She gave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">words strange little twists of mispronuncia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion--but the words were English! There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no doubting that they were English, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather that they had been English when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya's baby voice had sung them for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time into Inaa's ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It struck Northrup as an odd little thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this song alone should have remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the girl of the tongue which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mother's, this song which she could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand, but whose sounds had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept fresh through frequent repetition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, somehow, the whole thing struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as more pitiful than amusing, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">both elements mixed into it. Here was Ya-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoya, who had called him liar for saying she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no true goddess, singing in all serious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness her sacred song; down there, far below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a tribe of Indians listening to her sa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cred song with a sort of reverence. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">song itself was a nursery jingle!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        Buzzfuzz was a jolly fly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          Very blithe and gay!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        He began his lively dance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        With the break of day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       Up and down the window-pane</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         With a dainty tread,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        Sometimes on his tiptoes slides,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Sometimes on his head!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup caught a grin on Strang's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and could have kicked him for it. In his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own eyes he felt a sting of salt mist. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer had a desire to laugh at Yahoya</seg><seg type="columnLine">or at the face-lifted crowd below. He no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer felt resentment toward the girl. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did feel a quick impulse to sweep her up</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his arms, to hold her tightly, as one</seg><seg type="columnLine">might hold a very little, motherless child;</seg><seg type="columnLine">to carry her away from here and make life</seg><seg type="columnLine">over for her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      THE song died away and the still-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the Festival of Silence went</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it. A thunder of voices crash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed through the night. Wild yells, until now</seg><seg type="columnLine">pent up in riotous breasts, broke out every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where. And though the voices seemed cry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing all things in the world, from everywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose the shout:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yahoya! Yahoya! Yahoya!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down yonder the forms were circling</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunkenly now--men, women and children</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopping only that they might drink, reel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing more and more, shouting, lifting their</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices in shrill, finely drawn notes, like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yapping of a thousand coyotes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But from the seething mess came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">several forms, walking swiftly and straight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From here there was no need to look twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see that it was the old priest, Inaa, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">led them. Close behind him came Tiyo and</seg><seg type="columnLine">after him a score of young men, all armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as were the followers of Strang. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">now coming up the steps. Northrup looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly to see what Strang was doing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had gathered about him the half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen men who had come with him and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving sharp orders. Northrup marveled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little to see them, one after the other, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw until they had lost themselves in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows under the overhanging cliffs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If he means business," wondered North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup, "why doesn't he make the fight as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">come up the cliffs? The way Tiyo went for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him? Or has his nerve left him, after all?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, standing upon the cliff's edge where</seg><seg type="columnLine">all above and below might see them, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">three forms, that of a white-clad maiden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face radiant, a strange brightness in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, the form of Strang close to her at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, Northrup upon her right, a dozen steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Then there was old Inaa, standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">between Northrup and Yahoya, then Tiyo</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little back, his eyes like hard, cold stones</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Strang. The others who had followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">until now remained a score of steps from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the precipice where they were not to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen from below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now the show-down," grunted North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup to himself. "It's Strang against Tiyo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who wins?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inaa slowly lifted his hand. The shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ceased below; again the leaping forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew still save for a little swaying. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to Northrup, however, that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were vaguely restless, eager for the happen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of something at which he could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess. Was it merely the marriage cere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mony? Or were there many men down</seg><seg type="columnLine">there waiting a signal to take sides, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Strang, some with Inaa and Tiyo?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look, People of the Hidden Spring!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried Inaa suddenly, his voice floating out</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly, his two arms wide-flung. "See how</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inaa has kept you from under the heel of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world of Bahanas! How many have</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">37</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">come here in the memory of grown men?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two--no more. How many have gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">away again, to tell of what they have seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">here? None! Has not Inaa guarded you</seg><seg type="columnLine">well? Look before the light comes; see</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, across the desert, the eyes of Inaa</seg><seg type="columnLine">are watching!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Northrup, looking out the way the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man pointed across the wide sweep of</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert to the south, saw a great pillar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame standing red against the pale sky. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot upward from the distant mountain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaks, and he knew that at the least those</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaks were fifty miles away!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked to the eastward and saw again</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pillar of red fire lapping at the skies and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that it was little closer than the first.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked to the west and saw the third.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And suddenly, as he remembered the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian woman who had kept him alive, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that there was less madness than</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanity in the things she had told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was she one of the outposts of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange people, after all? Had her fires shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">their swift messages here that Inaa might</seg><seg type="columnLine">know if all were well? Had the blaze his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own hands had kindled before her dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes spoken to Inaa, too? Were there seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">citics of Chebo, as she had told; was this</seg><seg type="columnLine">people but the first of them? Had the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish adventurers but told the truth af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter all of the wonderful cities of Cibola; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had they remained all these years hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the white man? He felt his blood tin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling through him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked to the north. Here the cliffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood up so that one might not look far out</seg><seg type="columnLine">as in the other directions. But here, clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly outlined against the sky, was the form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man. And the man was shouting, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice coming down clearly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the north all is well, Father! The fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">burns red!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the people below shouted, crying:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The red fires burn! It is well!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And again they fell silent abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Inaa has guarded his children well,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on the priest solemnly. "For fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years has he not been Inguu and Inaa</seg><seg type="columnLine">(mother and father) to you? Because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gods were pleased did they not send one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their kind, the Goddess Yahoya, to live</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you? Did they not send the Bahana</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom you call the Man of Wisdom to cure</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sick and teach you how to make better</seg><seg type="columnLine">things from gold--beautiful things for you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wear, cups from which to drink? And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">has not Inaa kept the Bahana here so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might not go out to tell of what he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen and so bring the cursed white men</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, as they have gone everywhere else</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the world?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment he was silent. Then, his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered a little, he continued:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Inaa is old, his years weigh him down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya this night, her heart opened to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future, has said that already is the Skele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton House made ready for the coming of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inaa. But he does not go and leave his</seg><seg type="columnLine">people without a thought for their welfare.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He leaves behind him one to step into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, the biggest man among you, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mightiest with his hands, the swiftest run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner across the desert, the most tireless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiyo, the head captain of your young men!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">A great shout swept up from below:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tiyo! Tiyo! Tiyo!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, as silence was settling, a loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice boomed out:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tiyo for our Head Man; Yahoya for</seg><seg type="columnLine">our Goddess! Tiyo and Yahoya!" And</seg><seg type="columnLine">again many voices arose crying, "Tiyo and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tiyo himself, at a sharp glance from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man, came forward another step, swift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, standing very close to Yahoya, so close</seg><seg type="columnLine">that her gown brushed him. The cheering</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose more windily from below. Strang's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and Tiyo's met then. To Northrup it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a sheer wonder that the two men could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold themselves back from flying at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other's throats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While they shouted down there Inaa was</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking swiftly with Yahoya. Northrup</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not catch the words, but words were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not needed now to tell what Inaa was say-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. He was commanding, urging, threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening. And when Yahoya answered, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed that she had given him an answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">that pleased him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, my children," cried Inaa, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice ringing with the triumph in it. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Goddess is pleased with you this</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawning. Her heart is yours. It is not her</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish to journey back up through the skies</seg><seg type="columnLine">down which she came; it is not her wish to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move on down into the uncterworld where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the abode of the gods is. She will linger</seg><seg type="columnLine">here with you, she will wed Tiyo and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall be their children, blessed of the gods!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup could see that Yahoya was</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling. She leaned out over the abyss un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til he was afraid for her, thinking that mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness had come upon her and that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">38</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">going to fall. She lifted her hand and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell the great silence again, seeming now</seg><seg type="columnLine">more breathless than ever. And then, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything was still, when they waited and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered why she did not speak, suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">she broke the silence. And not with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken word, but with a clear burst of</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter leaping out over them from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">red lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inaa frowned and plucked at his beard;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiyo shifted his feet, looking uncertainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his father to Yahoya; Strang stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her much as Northrup was staring. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">still, until she had done, Yahoya gave free</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent to her tinkling laughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You have heard Inaa," she cried at last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her voice clear and steady, confident and</seg><seg type="columnLine">imperious. "Now hear Yahoya! Do I look</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you like one afraid? Do I tremble as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fear? Does my body shake as men's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies do when they look on death? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet have I been threatened tonight! Alik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sai. Listen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is the dawning and Yahoya, the God-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dess, has said that she would wed. Whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">would you have her take for husband, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">People of the Hidden Spring? Shall it be</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiyo here? He is hungry for me; he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking with the desire for me; Inaa bids</seg><seg type="columnLine">me marry him! Shall it be the Man of Wis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom? He is covetous of beautiful things</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he wants Yahoya! His eyes burn me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the greed in them. Shall I take him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for husband?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you not my people, O People of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hidden Spring? Shall not your wish enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart of the White Goddess? Cry out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a loud voice and say whom shall Yaho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ya wed?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup moved closer without knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he did so, thrilled with the girl's fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessness. He had heard her words to Strang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seen her seem to agree with Inaa.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What was she going to do?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She herself had given the sign for divi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. In the shouting which answered her</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were many voices clamoring for Tiyo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">many for Strang. And as by magic the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throng about the fires was shaken into its</seg><seg type="columnLine">two factions, women drawing back, men</seg><seg type="columnLine">grouping here and yonder about their lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait!" Yahoya's clear young voice cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the din like a bell through a roll of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder. "Wait and listen! The Man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wisdom has said to me: 'Will you wed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me?' And Yahoya, the Goddess, promised!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Inaa has said to me, 'Will you wed Tiyo</seg><seg type="columnLine">my son?' And Yahoya told him, 'I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised and a goddess may not break her</seg><seg type="columnLine">word!' What is the answer, my people?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only a murmur crept up to her in an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer. Men looked at her wonderingly, wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and listening as she had commanded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And again she laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yahoya will tell you," she cried lightly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her rising voice seeming to soar upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon wings of happiness. "Yahoya, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">goddess, may not lie. But what maiden</seg><seg type="columnLine">among you would not lie for her lover?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya, who is no goddess but a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">maid, will not wed with Tiyo. And she will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not wed with Strang, who is a coward. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">chooses her Own lover, and if it be death--</seg><seg type="columnLine">why then, she chooses death with him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Like a flash she had fled along the cliff-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge, sweeping by Tiyo, avoiding Inaa's</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutching fingers. She had sped to North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup's side and her arms flashed upward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Save me from them, Saxnorthrup!" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered. "I am only a maid--and I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Northrup stared down at the face at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his breast, he felt the wild flutter of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart against him and heard her whisper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of you only am I not afraid--because I</seg><seg type="columnLine">love you, Saxnorthrup!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONLY a little while ago Northrup</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself had said: "Love does not</seg><seg type="columnLine">come like this, in a hurry!" And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now he knew in a flash that then he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known nothing of it: that love comes as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wills, without man's bidding or consent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, madness though it might be, it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As his arms shut about her, hurting her</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that first embrace, his heart was beating</seg><seg type="columnLine">as wildly as hers. He wanted her; she be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed to him; and he was going to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">her!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wanted to get her away from here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make her happy; he wanted to show her</seg><seg type="columnLine">a world which would be like fairyland to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her; he wanted to teach her his language,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own forgotten tongue; he wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother her and father her and lover her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was at once to him both an incompar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able maiden and a little, frightened, hunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But while something deep within him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until now unawakened, talked to his soul of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these things, his eyes and brain were keenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive to what lay about him. The thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he read in Strang's eyes was little dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent from the thing he saw in the eyes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiyo and Inaa. Amazement first, then in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credulity which was still half stupefaction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then baffled rage and open threat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup's thought just then was that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to end with him and Yahoya go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over the cliff together. And yet, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that first wild moment, it was only elation</seg><seg type="columnLine">which beat through his heart. She lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head a little, looking straight up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes. And there before them all, not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be robbed of what life seemed to be bring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them at its close, he kissed her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You love me, Saxnorthrup?" the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I love you, Yahoya," he told her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Inaa wjio took the first step for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. Yahoya, seeing him coming, slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly from Northrup's arms. She alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been in a position to plan for all things</seg><seg type="columnLine">since she alone knew what Yahoya was go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to do. She cried out clearly, sending</seg><seg type="columnLine">her voice downward, calling:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will you hear Yahoya speak, my peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple? Will you bid Inaa stand back while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya speaks?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came quick answer to her, many</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices shouting:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yahoya! Listen to Yahoya!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down below, the two distinct factions</seg><seg type="columnLine">now stood fully separated, grouped upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite sides of the fires. Clearly they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were nearly equal in numbers; clearly then</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of the men down there hungered to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inaa and Tiyo fail in their wishes; while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other half clung to the old order and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to oppose Strang's party in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is our one chance," muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup, ready for whatever might hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pen; and he waited anxiously for Yahoya</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inaa, too, waited, and Tiyo and Strang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each for the moment uncertain.

Many of you, drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">off there against the cliffs, have your hearts</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with hatred of Inaa and Tiyo! Over</seg><seg type="columnLine">there stand you others, and your hearts are</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with hatred of the Man of Wisdom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Across the space between you your eyes run</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the eyes of wolves hungering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The People of the Hidden Spring love</seg><seg type="columnLine">their cornfields and their homes and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet lives of security.

Inaa began shouting; Tiyo's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined his angrily; Strang, stepping for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, called with them. And from below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of a little silence, came a great shout of</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us drink, brothers!" cried a loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. "We were bewitched. The maid is</seg><seg type="columnLine">right.

In the main the faction hating</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiyo was satisfied to see him thrust aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">for another; those hating Strang were sat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isfied in his discomfiture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Hopi are at heart peace-loving peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple; a dance and a feast appeal to them far</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than an orgy of blood. Here was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once a compromise and a huge joke on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">head men. And perhaps many lovers below</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt their rude sympathy for the lovers above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tiyo's twenty men, drawing closer now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at one another a trifle uncertainly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They began speaking in low tones and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup heard one of them laugh. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-dozen men Strang had left in the shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ows had been joined secretly by several</seg><seg type="columnLine">others; they too had drawn closer and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking among themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking to them Northrup saw a quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure flit out of Yahoya's stone building</seg><seg type="columnLine">and run toward them. It was the girl, Na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yangap. She went hastily to the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the young man, Muyingwa, and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking to him earnestly. And Muying-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wa, nodding, came on until he stood close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Yahoya's side. Strang stared at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aliksai. Listen!" he cried loudly, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the din below grew still. "It is I, Muying-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wa, who speak. Inaa has said that it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiyo who is the strongest of us, the swift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est runner. He lies! Even now will I run</seg><seg type="columnLine">out across the desert with Tiyo, as many</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles as he will and come back ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him! The men who are my men know this</seg><seg type="columnLine">and have no love for liars! So they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not see Yahoya wedded to one of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But with Yellow Beard it is different. Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inaa wed them and we shall throw down</seg><seg type="columnLine">our arms and feast. Then I will race with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiyo, and the man who is strongest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftest will be your head captain. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will vote for Inaa or the other as your</seg><seg type="columnLine">head priest. What say you? Is not Yaho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ya right? What man of us loves Tiyo or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man of Wisdom better than his own life?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While those bent upon strife murmured</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere, those who had gone into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">division half-heartedly or not at all, out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbered them many to one. When, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, Inaa sought to make himself heard, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one would listen; when Tiyo shouted, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">words were lost to the ears of those stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing close to him; when Strang shot out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp word and an evil glance at Muying-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wa, it was met with a hard stare. Muying-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wa had gone back to his mana, and the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them were standing like Northrup and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya, hand in hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was perhaps Muyingwa's offer to race</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Tiyo as much as anything which set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled the matter. There are no runners in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world like the runners of the southwest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern desert; they are men who can run an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbelievable number of miles out across</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing sands in the morning to dig in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields and run back the same evening. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">them running is at once a necessary thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a part of their religious training, and a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of settling just such debates as the one that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had arisen now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They began sweeping up along the steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps now, the men of the two factions min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling, jostling one another, each eager to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first to come to the top. Northrup</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed Yahoya's hand mightily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are a God-blessed wonder, Yaho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ya," he whispered. "We are going to pull</seg><seg type="columnLine">through."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You hurt my hand, Saxnorthrup!" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled up at him. "But--do it again!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SOON they were in the center of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great ring, they with Inaa, Strang</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tiyo.

And their eyes, when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had finished with Yahoya and Northrup,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already measured Tiyo and were seek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to measure Muyingwa that they might</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay their wagers upon the endurance run.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man is not head priest of such a peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple as this for fifty years without learning</seg><seg type="columnLine">something. There was not a cooler, craftier</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind among them than Inaa's. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">full well that in time of storm the reed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bends is better off than the stubborn tree.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He frowned warningly at Tiyo, then, mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his face over into its habitual mask,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to Yahoya.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yahoya has been pleased," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily, "to test her people.

But now that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife-blade caught the early light he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that none the less there were knives hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gering for him, perhaps for Yahoya. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that all about him was menace, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more terrible because it was glossed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">with smiles--a concealed, masked danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But these things he promptly forgot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inaa, fighting hard for the mastery of him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, and getting it wonderfully, gave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people what they demanded, a wedding.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup, looking down at Yahoya's up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned face, saw a great, unfeigned gladness</seg><seg type="columnLine">there.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no time for thought.

"I have displeased you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laughed at her, drew her even closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, kissing the alarmed look out of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was just thinking, my little wild girl,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told her gaily. "Thinking makes a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face look like that. I won't do it any more."</seg><seg type="columnLine">So much, loverwise. Then, man-like, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began thinking seriously again. Here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had come here, led by the lure of gold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he got out at all it seemed that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">go as empty-pocketed as he had come. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought disparagingly of the thousand dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars he had outside in a bank. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know much about the cost of women's gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, but he had the hazy idea that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of gown he wanted Yahoya to wear</seg><seg type="columnLine">would cost the greater part of his thousand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then, how was he going to take her</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere in the world, give her every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing she would be| sure to want? She'd be</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking for a hundred things every minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So much for the money end of it. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still left the greater question--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can we get out at all?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was almost as if she had read some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thoughts. She had slipped away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, running to the door of one of the ante-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms. Holding aside the curtain there, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said happily,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is Yahoya's sleeping-room. Will</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see how pretty it is, Saxnorthrup? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pretty things her people gave her as</seg><seg type="columnLine">gifts to the goddess?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hesitated at the door a moment, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain if he should profane it with his pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence. It drew from him a little gasp of ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miration and amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a couch made cozy with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skins thrown over it. A table, cunningly</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of wood so precious here, stood out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the center of the little room, a square of</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow-white buckskin thrown over it. Upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table was a vase with pale-blue flowers. ,</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the vase itself was of solid gold, skil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully hammered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon the floor, arranged about the walls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were countless cups and vases, tiny jugs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">belts, forehead bands, moccasin ornaments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jeweled bracelets--all of solid gold, many</seg><seg type="columnLine">set with flawless turquoises.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All presents to Yahoya," she smiled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "You see, Saxnorthrup, Yahoya was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a goddess and a great lady before she gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself away to you! And presently, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiyo and Muyingwa race, there will be more</seg><seg type="columnLine">presents. For me, the bride, and for you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bridegroom, Saxnorthrup."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She made herself comfortable upon one</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of her couch, drew up her feet under her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered her knees into her arms and dim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pled over them at Northrup.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No wonder Strang counts himself a mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lionaire," thought Northrup.

"What Seven Cities, Yahoya?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She lifted her brows at him in surprise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You do not know then? This is but one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Seven Cities of Chebo, the smallest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Yahoya has come but seldom for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Festival of Silence. The others have</seg><seg type="columnLine">many people and big houses in the cliffs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with wide stairways up and down, and hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of rooms. And in each is a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">house with five, six, nine rooms, all belong-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to Yahoya. Here I bring but two maids;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there I have many to dress my hair, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathe me, to do little things for me that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not wish to do. There I have many golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">things: a table all of gold, with many</seg><seg type="columnLine">turquoises; a little bed with golden feet;</seg><seg type="columnLine">white furs to walk on; a chair to ride in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy with gold, that strong men carry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You shall see, Saxnorthrup! And you shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that Yahoya does not come to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lover with empty hands!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nayangap and Tocha came in to serve</seg><seg type="columnLine">them a breakfast of milk and little corn-meal</seg><seg type="columnLine">cakes in Yahoya's room, and until they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, taking their trays away with them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup listened eagerly to what Ya-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoya had to tell him. And, in brief, this is</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he learned:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Seven Cities of Chebo controlled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">district, perhaps two hundred miles across.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were rich valleys, hidden in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains, where they grew their melons</seg><seg type="columnLine">and corn and cotton. There were mines</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which they took vast quantities of gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and silver, fashioning ornaments and table</seg><seg type="columnLine">sendee for the rich.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A young man was overlord of the Seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cities, having been elected to hold office</seg><seg type="columnLine">for life. He had turned his eyes upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya, but since he had already tw'o</seg><seg type="columnLine">wives, the priests, very powerful through-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the district, had forbidden him wed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ding her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In order that white men might not come</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a country which nature had so cun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ningly hidden from them, there were sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned out through the desert, upon any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water-trails, sentinels who signaled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire or smoke when a man came into sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Generally these were the older folk, men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and women, useless to the state for other</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposes, who believed that thus they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be pleasing their gods, and who con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered it a high honor to be chosen for so</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible a task.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So if a white man had turned toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seven Cities, he might not come within</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty miles of the nearest of them when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was met by runners sent out to intercept</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. A friendly greeting, a sharp knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the back, and one more name stricken</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the list of adventurers. Or, if men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were needed in the mines, a living death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Besides the outposts, there were lookouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the cliff-tops, alert, keen-eyed men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who did not miss the slinking form of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray coyote upon the gray sands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup thought swiftly of the sand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm, of his lying so long blotted out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight against the drifting sand; of how when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had at last come on, it was night, and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lookouts had perhaps come down to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">part in the Festival of Silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you did not know of the Seven Cit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ies," Yahoya asked him, "how is it that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you came journeying this way, Saxnorth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He began telling her of the Indian in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Santa Fe, only to be interrupted by Yahoya</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying quickly--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You were with Eddie then, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">runner died?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. Strang has told you about that?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No," she answered. "He always lied to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, not knowing that I knew he lied. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that in his heart he dreamed a dream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of me, and that that brought him across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands, hurrying!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup grunted. Then, moved to</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity he demanded--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If Strang didn't tell you of it, how do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tiyo told me," she answered, puzzling</seg><seg type="columnLine">him still more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tiyo? Who told Tiyo?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He was there. It was Tiyo who shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poisoned arrow in at the window."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tiyo went way down to Santa Fe, killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his man, and came back here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The other was Chiwakala, son of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man that Strang would make head</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest in the place of Inaa. Chiwakala was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a friend of Kish-taka, the Hawk Man, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">is overlord of the Seven Cities, and not with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out power himself. Between him and Tiyo</seg><seg type="columnLine">there has always been rivalry and hatred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kish-taka sought to make him head captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the youths of the Hidden Spring. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">even Kish-taka's power was less in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter than Inaa's, and so Tiyo was</seg><seg type="columnLine">elected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Chiwakala was bad in his heart, nuk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pana. People said he was a Powaka, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">casts evil and sickness into men. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiyo's doing that Chiwakala was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">demned to spend all his life down in a mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">where bad men and women are put, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">those that Kish-taka or the priests do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">like. Then Chiwakala, who was a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">runner like Tiyo and Muyingwa, fled, hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in his heart to go out among the Bahana</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, because he hated Tiyo and others, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">send certain of the Bahanas into our land,</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling them of riches to be had.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Chiwakala went swiftly, but Tiyo went</seg><seg type="columnLine">after him, also swiftly. Chiwakala, coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">first among the Bahanas, had told his story,</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and men laughed at him, calling him liar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, in Santa Fe, he was to tell a man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">is known among the Bahanas as a hardy</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventurer. There Tiyo came up with him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, shooting quickly through the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">window a little blue-winged arrow with</seg><seg type="columnLine">poison tip, killed him. Then Tiyo came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, and even Kish-taka, who had be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">friended Chiwakala, said that he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">nukpana, and that Tiyo had done well for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people of the Seven Cities."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From Santa Fe, Northrup estimated</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly that he had traversed some four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred miles in coming here. A round</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip of eight hundred miles! And yet Ya-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoya spoke of the matter lightly, as if Tiyo</seg><seg type="columnLine">had run but a little way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long was Tiyo gone?" he asked cu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "From the moonrise when he departed</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the dawning when he dropped down</seg><seg type="columnLine">before me," she answered, "twenty days had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Twenty days!" gasped Northrup.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh," she said quickly, misunderstanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thought, "it was because he lost time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking out Chiwakala among the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. Tiyo would have come back sooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">but for that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eight hundred miles in twenty days!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Yahoya was apologizing for Tiyo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowness! A clip of over forty miles a day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">day in and day out, over such country as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup knew stretched between these</seg><seg type="columnLine">people and Santa Fe! It was incredible--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet it was the sober truth. For here</seg><seg type="columnLine">are a people not like other men, a people</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a strange, seemingly tireless power and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftness, that is the result of desert train-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, inheritance, evolution, all aided by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">religious ceremonies calling for an abnor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mally developed physique. The desert had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made creatures like the coyote, the snake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jackrabbit that knew how to live a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time without water. The desert had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made its own plant life to exist and flourish</seg><seg type="columnLine">where water was not. The desert had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">its men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even now that a great issue held in bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, that issue was to be decided by such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a race as perhaps no white man had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. Tiyo and Muyingwa, down in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canon were ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shall we go out upon the cliff edge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch them?" said Northrup. "I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that very much depends on this race--for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and me, Yahoya!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       XIV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TIYO and Muyingwa showed an</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal eagerness to be off. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood side by side, stripped, the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">already beating hot upon their naked bod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ies. As he looked down, Northrup mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veled how the desert had made her children</seg><seg type="columnLine">into what they must be to wrest nourish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and draw life from her barren breasts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men were alike, as he looked upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from the back. Their shoulders were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not wide, though they were tall men, both</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. Their bodies were slender, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">reed-like in smooth symmetry and pliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">toughness. There was no hint of a useless</seg><seg type="columnLine">ounce of flesh, nothing but hard muscle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But while bigness of body was nowhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident in the torsos, which were none the</seg><seg type="columnLine">less magnificent, the hips were thicker than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hips of white men, the thighs bulged</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with endurance in every knotted sinew;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the calves were the swelling, powerful calves</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Marathon men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The desert Indian in his heart is a born</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambler, his love for hazard no whit less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the Mongolian's. Already were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">onlookers caught in a fever of excitement</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they cried out for their favorites and eag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erly sought takers for their wagers. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voices coming up to him Northrup knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one man was seeking to bet his whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">year's yield of corn that Tiyo would come</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the victor; that another staked many</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold cups on Muyingwa; that even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women were wagering personal ornaments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where will they run?" he asked of Ya-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoya.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yonder," she pointed, "to the foot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that peak, without water on the way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There grow red flowers that are found no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where else. The one who brings the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">flower back wins. It is the custom."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup judged that to the base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff it was at the least fifteen miles. A race</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thirty miles through the hot sun, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">without water!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who will win?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shook her head thoughtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It lies with the gods, Saxnorthrup.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There are in the world no two runners like</seg><seg type="columnLine">them since Chiwakala is dead. No man</seg><seg type="columnLine">could beat them--except you, Saxnorth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup!" she ended loyally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord!" grunted Northrup. "I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrivel up in about ten minutes!" But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke in English.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inaa made his way through the throng</seg><seg type="columnLine">which drew back for him. From a cup in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand he sprinkled water upon both men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The gods watch you, my sons," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">loudly. "Run!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They broke away from the throng which</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched them silently and went down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentle slope from the canon mouth at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trot, their elbows rubbing. Northrup</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted how Tiyo held his arms drawn up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little so that the relaxed hands were close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his stomach; how Muyingwa ran with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms at his sides, the hands dangling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in their action he saw no other differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence. There was the same free stride, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same way of bending the body slightly for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward with the head held up a little, the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy play of muscles and rhythmic swing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I had to bet on either of them," was</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thought, "I'd toss a coin for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, mindful of what the result of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the race might mean to Yahoya and to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he cried sharply:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go to it, Muyingwa! I'm backing you!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like two great, gaunt greyhounds, Tiyo</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Muyingwa were already slipping out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the desert, their bare feet seeming</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely to touch the loose sand. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">had hit his stride, and Northrup saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">now Muyingwa was setting the pace, forg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a step ahead, and that Tiyo seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite content to drop the step behind. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowned as he asked of Yahoya---</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Which man has won the most races in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his life?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And she answered--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tiyo."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steadily, each keeping to his stride, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two passed out into the gray expanse, Muy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingwa increasing the distance lying between</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and his rival, Tiyo never seeming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see Muyingwa. Now, more than ever be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, did the desert seem like a mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean, with these men, two bold swimmers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking straight out into it, and the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">must arise in the mind of a white man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched them: "Is their strength so mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing that it will not forsake them before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they can get back?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But they would be back soon enough, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then there would be a settling of scores.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup drew his eyes away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two forms growing smaller in the distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to blend into the monotone of</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert, and stared down at the throng below</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He found Strang in a center of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of silent, attentive men. Beyond</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him was Inaa, the priest, also with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">group around him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are like a crowd of schoolboys,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought Northrup. "Ready to break off</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the middle of a fight to watch a race;</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to get into mischief again the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yahoya," he said gently, "do you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it will mean for us if Tiyo wins this</seg><seg type="columnLine">race?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes." She spoke quite steadily, slip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping her hand into his, and smiling a little.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But we are not afraid to die, you and I,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saxnorthrup."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So it would be death then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For you," she told him, "it would be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">laborer's work down in the mines.

We would not wait,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saxnorthrup, you and I."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What would we do?" he asked curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously, wondering at the girl's calmness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When we saw Tiyo running home before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muyingwa we would leap out to meet him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saxnorthrup.

"But if they wished they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">come up with us out in the desert, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are no cliffs out there for us to leap</seg><seg type="columnLine">from, Saxnorthrup."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MEN were already coming up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canon, seeking the heights from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they might watch the race</seg><seg type="columnLine">until Tiyo and Muyingwa were lost to even</seg><seg type="columnLine">their piercing eyes. In a little the level</seg><seg type="columnLine">space would be crowded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us go back into the house, Yahoya,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested Northrup. "There we can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone for a little. And there we can have</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain men come presently whom we shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to talk with."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before they could gain the wide doorway</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup saw many hard, frowning eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">46</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">turned upon him, and knew that a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">while ago these same eyes had looked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughingly at his wedding with Yahoya.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Indians had enjoyed the moment, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found perhaps a pleasure in piquing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once Strang and Tiyo and Inaa, had yielded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the impulse of the moment and Yahoya's</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence over them. But now stood out</seg><seg type="columnLine">their eternal hatred of a white man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quickly the level space about the pool</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the spires of rock uplifted into the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">were covered with men seeking to find the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two little moving dots in the wide sweep of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand. Early among them came the girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nayangap. With no glance at Northrup</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, stooping swiftly, she caught up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hem of Yahoya's gown and lifted it to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yahoya," she said softly, her voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled, as were her eyes, "goddess or maid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is all the same to the heart of Nayangap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In her heart Nayangap loves you and wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are a good girl," said Yahoya, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little touch of her old air of a young queen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Look. I give you this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She caught up one of the many jeweled</seg><seg type="columnLine">cups from the floor. Nayangap shook her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, saying quickly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nayangap does not come for presents.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She brings you word from Muyingwa."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup looked at the girl eagerly. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time now, Nayangap looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. And it was to him rather than to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya that she spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Muyingwa will win the race, because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the better man, and because the gods love</seg><seg type="columnLine">him best! Then his followers--and they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">many--will name him head captain of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young men, in Tiyo's place. Then, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the good men who are fair in their hearts</seg><seg type="columnLine">will name him head captain because they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have said the man who wins will be their</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief. But there are others and they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">many, too, who are nukpana. They will</seg><seg type="columnLine">break their promises as if they were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shells of humming-birds' eggs. Then, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause Muyingwa is no coward, there may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great spilling of blood."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on," said Northrup impatiently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing that the girl was stopping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her eyes had been very hard. Now, sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, they grew soft, and into her dusky</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks a tide of red surged up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Muyingwa loves power and gold!" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried passionately. "Muyingwa loves to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strive with other men. But most of all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Muyingwa loves a mana, and that mana is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nayangap! His heart sings like a thrush</seg><seg type="columnLine">and makes music in Nayangap's heart when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he comes to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nayangap loves gold, too, and she loves</seg><seg type="columnLine">power for Muyingwa, and pretty gowns for</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself. But most of all she loves Muying-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wa's self. And after Muyingwa she loves</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya! This Muyingwa knows. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart is big; he would give to his mana all</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. So he has called me aside before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">race and told me what I must do for Yaho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ya's sake."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If Yahoya were in truth goddess," cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya, her eyes bright, "she would make</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muyingwa this day overlord of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seven Cities! Since she is but a maid like</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Nayangap, she prays to the gods for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the word of Muyingwa," went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nayangap swiftly. "There will be a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle and many men will go down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maski. But Muyingwa will win because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have the stronger party, and because</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gods are with him. He has no love for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Man of Wisdom, who has tricked him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying that Yahoya would be left free to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">what she wished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Muyingwa says that if the fight comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya is to stay in her kiva, where harm</seg><seg type="columnLine">can not come to her; and that her lover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yellow Beard, shall come out to stand at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muyingwa's right hand and fight the fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Askwali.

That is</seg><seg type="columnLine">best."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nayangap withdrew upon her errand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">going swiftly. Yahoya came to Northrup,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, putting up her arms, looking up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My man," she said softly.

And now sleep, Saxnorth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wonder is that Northrup did sleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He awoke from a dream of sitting in a box</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the theater with Yahoya, watching her</seg><seg type="columnLine">while she watched the actors. Yahoya was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">47</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bending over him, her hand laid lightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The lookout has called out that he can</seg><seg type="columnLine">see them returning, Muyingwa and Tiyo,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said gravely.

That is good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their eyes upon his were hard and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressionless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We are Muyingwa's men," said one</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluntly. "We obey our orders."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Again there were many men upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge, all looking out toward the desert</seg><seg type="columnLine">where their eyes had found the forms of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">racers. Before Northrup and Yahoya had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to where they too could see, Strang</seg><seg type="columnLine">had moved out of a knot of men and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come swiftly to meet them. A good deal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bluster of a few hours ago had oozed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of him; he was looking anxious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here, Northrup," he said hurriedly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"it strikes me that there's going to be an</seg><seg type="columnLine">almighty row in no time. You and I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">had our troubles and there's no denying it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But at a time like this I guess we've got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember we're white men stacked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a bunch of damned Indians. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">chip in on my side, and I'll see you through</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we come out of this alive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strang was armed like the Indians; now</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup was certain that the man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">either lost his gun out in the desert or had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it taken away from him here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll chip in on your side," returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup coldly, "not because I am fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to believe a man like you, Strang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but just because I see my one chance with</seg><seg type="columnLine">your crowd."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw in Strang's eyes a quick light of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerness. Then the light died down, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes grew anxious again. Plainly Strang</seg><seg type="columnLine">was afraid. He sought to speak further,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Northrup and Yahoya passed on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everywhere were black looks turned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them, many men sneering openly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya, who was no longer goddess, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere maid; many of them speaking of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ugly voices, which they did not seek to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep from his ears. Northrup looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya swiftly; it was if she had neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen nor heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But again men forgot them for the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Tiyo and Muyingwa from being</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere slow, drifting dots grew into two men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">striving mightily. From afar it was clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had fought their way, mile after</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile, with skill and cunning and muscle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were now two staggering, dust-cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered forms, and no mau yet could tell which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Muyingwa, which Tiyo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On they came, plunging across the loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand which caught at the feet that no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">might spurn it lightly, their lean bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouching, their arms dangling, their knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising and falling only because stubborn</seg><seg type="columnLine">wills drove them. On they staggered, nei-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther man looking up, their hearts near</seg><seg type="columnLine">bursting, their dry, dusty tongues lolling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bodies rocking as in agony. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a reeling world, with only a scant</seg><seg type="columnLine">two or three yards between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And only silence greeting them, as men</seg><seg type="columnLine">strove to see which of those dark, tortured</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms grasping a wilted flower in a dangling</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, was Tiyo, which Muyingwa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, at last, they had come so close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the base of the cliffs that they were recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nizable human beings, no longer merely ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted machines. A great crowd rumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to greet them then, many voices shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing together--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tiyo!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For it was Tiyo in the lead. Even North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup saw that now, and realized swiftly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiyo's winning would strengthen Tiyo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, so that there would be little hope for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muyingwa and those whom he stood ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to befriend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the shout the two men jerked up their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads. Their faces were twisted and hag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gard; their mouths dropped open; their</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were wild, telling mutely of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">anguish-racked bodies upon which so terri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble a tax had been levied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the heads dropped, the gaunt forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered on, feet sinking deep into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand, being caught there, dragged out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort more and more obvious. And still, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">great distance between them and the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the long run, Tiyo held his place in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ri</seg><seg type="columnLine">48</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now many voices called out, "Muying-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wa! Muyingwa!" but they called half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heartedly. Through the bedlam rose the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrill cry of a woman, a wail of grief; Nayan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gap, hurrying down the stairway to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">her defeated lover, carried to him a face</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely less tortured than his own. Ya-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoya slipped her hand into Northrup's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look," she whispered. "If to-day you</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall, my husband, Yahoya will fall with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun flashed a moment upon the keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">blade she had slipped from her gown.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, as quickly as it had come, the knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gone, and she was pressing his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On came Tiyo, staggering more drunk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enly than ever, fighting for every step. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">came Muyingwa just behind him, head</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and dogged. Cheer after cheer broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to greet the victor; cheer after cheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">drummed into the ears of the man who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">challenged and who was losing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inaa, his eyes seeming on fire, was draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with a sacred baho a small circle at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of the slope. Already were Tiyo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet upon the harder ground, already was he</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunging, reeling up the first of the hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards of incline. He swung up one arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a visible effort, showing the fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripping the stem of the red flower. Inaa's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, until now stilled, called out trium-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phantly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On, Tiyo, my son! The victor's circle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherein is room for one man only, awaits</seg><seg type="columnLine">you! On, Tiyo!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Tiyo turned a little for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time and saw Muyingwa's bowed, reeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">form behind him. Tiyo's staring eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting mouth grew into a twisted smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Tiyo did not turn again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they ran the two men stumbled now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their numb feet striking against the stones</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their path, each seeming ever upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">verge of falling. If Tiyo should indeed fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">--if Muyingwa fell--then before either man</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get upon his feet the race would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed to Northrup that Muyingwa</seg><seg type="columnLine">was driving some last ounce of reserve</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength into his lagging limbs. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">while a man could not be certain, that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shaved off a fraction of the half-dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet stretching between him and Tiyo. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he had cut off an inch, what of it? There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were but seventy-five yards now, and Tiyo</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a man's height in advance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup caught a glimpse of a face</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust close up to his own, Strang's face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The blood had drawn out of it, leaving a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange pallor over the sunburned skin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The - quitter!" groaned Strang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"He said he could beat Tiyo!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You talk about a quitter!" snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup. "Shut up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed now that nothing less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracle could save the day for Muyingwa,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless Tiyo should fall. And why should</seg><seg type="columnLine">one fall rather than the other?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a flutter of white close by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inaa's side. Nayangap stood there, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms thrown out toward the men racing so</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly up the broken slope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Muyingwa!" she called. "Muyingwa!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not lift his head as he struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on; he gave no sign that he had heard. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet, in the silence which had fallen, a silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of breathless, intense eagerness, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not but have heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tiyo!" thundered Inaa. "Tiyo! Ti-yo!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Muyingwa!" cried Nayangap. "Mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yingwa!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The eyes of those who watched, drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an instant to the forms of the old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the young mana, came back quickly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the runners. Was it in the seeming only,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or had Muyingwa crept a little closer?</seg><seg type="columnLine">With hard ground underfoot, with Nayan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gap's voice ringing in his ears, had he added</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little swiftness to his slow plodding? Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">he, in fact, held a little reserve force for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">final dash? Was Tiyo, already so close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the victor's circle, and with his rival in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear, already the victor?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was ending as a distance run so rarely</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends, with the end in doubt until the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">close of endeavor. Muyingwa was gaining.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiyo was driving his muscles harder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">harder at every lagging step to make them</seg><seg type="columnLine">bend to his will. But they were only</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-five yards from the goal, and Tiyo</seg><seg type="columnLine">still led the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tiyo!" shouted Inaa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Muyingwa!" cried the girl, her voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">throbbing in its appeal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then all were still, their bodies tense,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their breathing hushed, their hearts beating</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickly. Northrup's hand, gripping Yaho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ya's, grew into a vise, which at another</seg><seg type="columnLine">time would have hurt her cruelly. Yahoya</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not feel it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no sound now save the rattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stones set rolling, the thud, thud, thud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare bleeding feet dropping heavily, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gasping breathing of Tiyo and Muyingwa.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One might fancy that he heard the hammer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of their hearts, despair in one not un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinged with wild hope, victory in the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched with dread. For Tiyo could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muyingwa's whistling breath close upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right, a step behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So they came to the worst of the broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground not a dozen yards from the circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inaa had drawn. Here an exhausted man</seg><seg type="columnLine">might fall if he were not wary. In each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bursting hearts was the same thought:</seg><seg type="columnLine">if a man fall now he sees his rival win.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tiyo, having everything to lose, feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself already crowned with green leaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yellow flowers, swerved a step to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left. Muyingwa, feeling the game all but</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost already, kept straight ahead. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">thudding feet struck among the jagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones, which cut at them and tore them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with cruel knife-edges. Muyingwa felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing, but flung himself forward, stagger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, falling, catching himself, staggering on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tiyo saw him from the corner of his eye,</seg><seg type="columnLine">abreast now, and, gathering his last strength,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeled on, gaining a little. Muyingwa saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, fluttering gown just there in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him, saw Tiyo at his side, and made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">supreme call upon his quivering muscles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He struck a stone in his way, pitching over</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, close to falling for the hundredth time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Muyingwa!" Hardly more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">maid's whisper, but many men heard it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My man!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tiyo had run his race, and was tottering</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost at the rim of the circle his dizzy eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not see. Muyingwa was like a spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball, plowing on with its own momentum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiyo's foot struck a little mound of loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirt and he fell. As he went down he threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his hand, and Muyingwa, striking it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell with him. Both men down, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">goal just there, where it seemed either man</seg><seg type="columnLine">might reach it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then men shouted as they had not shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed until now, so that Inaa's voice and Na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yangap's were lost in the thunderous roar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The canon echoes went mad with the word,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tiyo, Tiyo, Tiyo!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The canon walls themselves seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have awakened, moved at last from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold slumber, and to be shouting, "Mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yingwa!" Northrup heard men yelling about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and did not know that his own voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lending its volume to theirs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Would the men never get to their feet?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Did they not know what hung upon them?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Were they loitering now at the very end?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But they were up now. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on, both of them. It seemed as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were seeking to drive men mad, lifting</seg><seg type="columnLine">their feet so slowly, holding them so long</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspended in air, taking such puny, baby</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps ahead. Even their faces were drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">into grotesque grins, as if they were mocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who clamored for them, jeering at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. Who was ahead now? Their elbows</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now men saw that at each slow step</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was Tiyo who held longest balanced upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his spreading toes; it was Tiyo's leg which</seg><seg type="columnLine">held longest suspended in air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Muyingwa threw high up above his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand gripping the broken flower. Sway-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing terribly, Muyingwa set his foot over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Muyingwa stood first in the narrow circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherein there is room for only one man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, staring stupidly at Nayangap he</seg><seg type="columnLine">half turned, seeing through a blur another</seg><seg type="columnLine">man coming on falteringly. Then Mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yingwa, not hearing the roar of voices,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped his arm, stooped a little, a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, sought to lift his hand and could not,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocked blindly back and forth, and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength and consciousness going out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, fell heavily. And as he fell, Tiyo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body pitched forward and fell across him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XVI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"QUICK!" cried Northrup sharply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Into your house, Yahoya. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be ready now for what comes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Drawing her after him he hurried through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clamoring throng. He realized that now</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment, men would not be thinking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and Yahoya. Now was the time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to get her where she would be safest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would not have been afraid for Yahoya</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it not been for the look he had seen in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inaa's eyes so few hours ago. The old man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">temper would have hardly been sweetened by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiyo's defeat, nor his anger at Yahoya</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two men Muyingwa had deputed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand guard at the kiva's entrance had quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally forsaken their posts, but were</seg><seg type="columnLine">back now as Yahoya and Northrup went in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That day Northrup and Yahoya sat long</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone together in her little room, waiting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nor did time drag for them, there was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much in each heart which must be told to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">50</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the man looked into the clear gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, fearless, and filled with the love she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given him so generously, he sought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">close his thoughts to what might lie in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future for them both. One of the rare mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of a man's life had come to him when</seg><seg type="columnLine">past and future are hazy and unimportant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he lives richly and to the full in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing present. He no longer marveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the love which had come to them. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed as natural a thing as the sunshine</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A third man joined the two at the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke with them in quick, sharp tones, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went away. The two remained, keeping their</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent watch, calm, seeming untouched by</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of a near crisis. Tocha came and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought food, saying that Nayangap was</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Muyingwa, and that both her lover</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tiyo were like men whose souls had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone down to Maski.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All forms had disappeared from the ledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the pool was. Yahoya's parrot</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed upon his branch, admired his gay</seg><seg type="columnLine">plumage in the water's clear mirror, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew to the kiva seeking his mistress. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canon where the men of the tribe were</seg><seg type="columnLine">assembled came a voice only now and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">at long intervals. Then, at last, came Na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yangap, her eyes bright, her face suffused</seg><seg type="columnLine">with happiness, a strange elation in her man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen!" she cried to Yahoya, running</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her mistress. "In a moment you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear the shouting. Down there they pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim Muyingwa head captain in Tiyo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">place!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And Tiyo?" demanded Northrup ea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerly. "What does he say about it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is not Muyingwa the greater man, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">better?" the girl flashed at him. "Did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muyingwa beat Tiyo so that all men might</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup had not noted that Tiyo's de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feat was so marked as that, but he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. Yahoya smiled a little at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">maid's loyal enthusiasm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Men who are wise and men who are</seg><seg type="columnLine">good," ran on Nayangap, "will draw to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muyingwa's side, calling him their chief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Men whose hearts are black and who listen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the words of Inaa will stand with Tiyo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then will Muyingwa lead his men out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike down the men of Tiyo!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before she had finished Strang came hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riedly into the kiva, brushing by her rudely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Both of them are on their feet again,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he said quickly. "They have eaten and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk, and though they have been already</seg><seg type="columnLine">through hell today, both of them are as fit</seg><seg type="columnLine">right now as an ordinary man! What are</seg><seg type="columnLine">the devils made of? And trouble is coming,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming quick!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why then are you not with your men?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried Yahoya swiftly. "It is you who have</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred them up to this madness, you with</seg><seg type="columnLine">your whisperings! And now you come here</seg><seg type="columnLine">--you coward!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Coward, am I?" he snarled at her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What about the man you keep here with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He broke off sharply. From the canon</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the mighty shout, "Muyingwa!" And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as had already so many times happened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an answering shout arose, "Tiyo!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had come. Until strength had crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into the two exhausted bodies of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">principals, the tribe had waited. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved everywhere by Muyingwa's ringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">words and Inaa's, fierce fire had flashed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smoldering restlessness. There came</seg><seg type="columnLine">other cries, sharper cries, the shriek of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with a knife driven into his body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup, gathering Yahoya passion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately into his arms, held her there a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. Then he pushed by Strang, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran out to the edge of the cliffs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BELOW, the men of the tribe had</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn into two compact masses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fronting each other ominously, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">short stabbing spears lifted. Between them</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay a man, writhing, slowly growing still.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup's first thought was that it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be Muyingwa or Tiyo. But another glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed both of them in front of their fac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, Muyingwa shouted out some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, and his men, following him, ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the long stairway. Tiyo saw, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstood, and shouting bore down upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Northrup, seeing that both factions</seg><seg type="columnLine">strove now for the higher ground, ran to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head of the stairway, his automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped, ready for use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fighting began at the foot of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairway. Already the two sides had mixed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, although Muyingwa's men came first</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the stair, its narrow steepness held them</seg><seg type="columnLine">back a little. Northrup saw Muyingwa's</seg><seg type="columnLine">form surrounded by his men, saw Tiyo and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inaa, and the great spare form of the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strang had selected for head priest to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">place Inaa. He saw the whole body of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">51</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bristling with short spears and great knives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun glittering upon them brightly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seething back and forth, struggling for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One by one Muyingwa's men in the fore</seg><seg type="columnLine">were passing up; in the rear they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking now, dealing death, and often</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough being dragged down to the death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in the strange silence which fell over</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, all the struggle down there looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">some weird play, scarcely real. It was hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him to convince himself that this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a mock battle, that the distorted faces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the writhing of fallen bodies, was not all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sham and skilful acting. About them the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains were so serene, above, the skies</seg><seg type="columnLine">so deep a blue, the whole atmosphere so</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged with quiet peacefulness. High in</seg><seg type="columnLine">air a vulture hung on motionless wings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching with sharp eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when men fell stricken by those great</seg><seg type="columnLine">knives and two-edged spears, they did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">move from where they had fallen; or at best</seg><seg type="columnLine">but dragged their wounded bodies a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to fall and lie still. Tiyo's men pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward; Muyingwa's men held back, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many were swiftly mounting the stairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that Northrup wondered. For cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly Muyingwa's force was larger than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one that attacked him, and as certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muyingwa was no coward. But now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew his men back, ever back, until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gained the stairway, while Tiyo's sinis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter crowd charged stubbornly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now men were contending everywhere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the floor of the canon, along the cliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, even at the top of the stairway, close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to where Northrup stood. He saw them go</seg><seg type="columnLine">down under vicious thrusts, saw two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, their arms locked about each other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their skins red with many wounds, reel out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and drop fifty feet. And as yet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun in his hand was cold, for there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">way for him to determine which man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muyingwa's man, which Tiyo's. And to</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance a shot at Tiyo or at Inaa in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">packed mass would be to waste lead, or per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps to kill a friend of Muyingwa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he saw something which he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not understand. He figured roughly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tribe numbered between two and three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred men. Muyingwa and the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him now pressing up the steep way</seg><seg type="columnLine">which led to the ledge were not over twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five in number; the party at Tiyo's heels</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have numbered only about that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And down in the canon the rest of the men,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a great mass of them, had drawn aside, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were merely watching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last Muyingwa had come to the top.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stood there, shouting out his short com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mands, then stepped back, his men follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him, leaving the way open for such men</seg><seg type="columnLine">as might wish to come up after them. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">again seemed madness to Northrup, who,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grumbling, gave way with the others. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Muyingwa's voice in his ear that ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let them come, Yellow Beard! We</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall fight them here in the open, man to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">man!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the others, down there?" demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is my fight and Tiyo's. Each of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">has chosen twenty-five of his young men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rest watch. And I have chosen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man of Wisdom and you to be of my num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then," cried Northrup hotly, "why do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you wait for them to come up with you?</seg><seg type="columnLine">You have the advantage now; strike as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they climb up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An odd smile touched Muyingwa's stern</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is in my heart to fight fair, Yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beard. It is not Muyingwa's wish to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">named the 'Fox.' Men already speak of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as the Eagle Chief! Let them come!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Then," demanded Northrup, "why</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't you fight your fight down there?</seg><seg type="columnLine">You had the chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Muyingwa shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will tell you, Yellow Beard, but time</seg><seg type="columnLine">has passed for long words. I am the better</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and Tiyo knew that when he raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me. But for trickery on his part I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have come into the circle an hour be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore him. Look!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He threw up his arm, and for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time Northrup saw a long gash in the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When we were far out, where men could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not see us," he said, his face black with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger, "Tiyo, who was behind, ran like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">madman that he might come up with me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saved my strength, thinking he had lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">his senses. Then, when he was upon me, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that he had carried a knife with him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealing it cunningly under his arm. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have killed me then had I not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greater man! Even so--you saw it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I won over him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All of Muyingwa's men were upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge now. At their head man's command</seg><seg type="columnLine">52</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they had drawn back and were watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">those with Tiyo come up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have sworn an oath to the great gods,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muyingwa ended briefly. "I have prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ised them that if they let me triumph over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiyo in the race, I should kill Tiyo with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own hands in a way that all men might see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up the stairway, after the last of Tiyo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, came surging many others who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager to stand back and see. Northrup,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glancing about, saw that many others were</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing swiftly to the cliffs upon the oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">site side of the canon. After that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">little enough time or opportunity to see any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing but the steely menace before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tiyo's men, mistaken in the reason for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muyingwa's retreat, thinking that they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do with men whose hearts were already</seg><seg type="columnLine">failing them, bore on at a run, lifting their</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices in a hideous charging shout. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">man carried his stabbing spear drawn a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little back at his hip, so that when the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment came a quick thrust outward would</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive the keen edges through a man's body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It came to Northrup, even at the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the running line struck, that Tiyo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the better generalship, that Muying-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wa's men, waiting, must go down before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the force of the wild attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The spit of Northrup's gun was lost in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm of shouting. But a man had thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide his arms and had gone down in a heap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were twenty feet away, every running</seg><seg type="columnLine">leap cutting the distance down so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup must fire as fast as he could to</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty the first clip. And he realized, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips tightened grimly, that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no chance for a second. And still</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muyingwa's men were standing erect, wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But they were men trained under Mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yingwa's own eye, cool to the last, mindful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders. Suddenly came Muyingwa's shout,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and suddenly the spears in his men's hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">were lifted. Lifted, balanced high over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, and, when the eyes of the men charg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them glared redly not three-spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengths away, the short spears were hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">outward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then many of Tiyo's men went down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">both sides of Tiyo himself, who came on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">untouched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two lines met, Tiyo's men that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">left wielding their spears mightily, Muying-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wa's men driving home their broad-bladed</seg><seg type="columnLine">knives with little coughing grunts. North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rup did not know that his gun was empty,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had cast it down, that somewhere his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands had closed about a fallen spear. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">only knew that about him surged a mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">carnage, that men were shouting, cursing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieking; that a man drove at him with up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted spear, only to graze his shoulder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stop dead in his tracks with Northrup's</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear driven fairly through his body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tiyo and Muyingwa had met at last.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup saw that dimly, as if through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fog, saw and forgot as again he was breast</seg><seg type="columnLine">to breast with a great-bodied man, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">red with blood, and who held high above</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head a dripping knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The knife swept downward, and Northrup</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt it like a burning iron in his neck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. A wild rage came upon him, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning hatred, and from then on nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clear to him, no emotion rode him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one unleased primitive desire to kill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill, kill! He struck out savagely, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who had cut at him went down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tiyo and Muyingwa were still struggling;</seg><seg type="columnLine">yonder two of Tiyo's men drove their spears</seg><seg type="columnLine">through one man so that the steel heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck together; yonder Strang, his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashen, hurled his spear at a man who rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon him and, missing, shrieked</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly; close to the edge of the precipice</seg><seg type="columnLine">three men drove two back, fighting for every</seg><seg type="columnLine">step of the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then bigness of body and strength of</seg><seg type="columnLine">limb stood Sax Northrup in such stead as</seg><seg type="columnLine">never until now. Where the fray was thick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est there was his great form, his clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">splotched red, his eyes spitting blue fire, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair and beard wet with blood. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck, a man must give back; when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust, a man must go down; when a thirst-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blade drank of his own blood, his roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like the cry of a wounded lion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now it seemed that the struggle had</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept like great whirlpools about two cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters. Tiyo and Muyingwa had been swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart, both wounded, both standing grimly</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to their bloody work. A surging knot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men contended near the edge of the cliffs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Close to Yahoya's kiva, Muyingwa was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of a ring of glittering blades seek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through this ring of men came Northrup,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a mad bull breaking through a flimsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence. Two men went down before him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and but one rose again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stumbled over a prone man, and did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know that it was Strang's body his foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">53</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had struck. Muyingwa was here, one man</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a half dozen, and it was unfair fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. That was the one thing perfectly plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now no longer was Muyingwa one</seg><seg type="columnLine">against six. Back to back stood Northrup</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Muyingwa, the two biggest men upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ledge. Muyingwa, striking swiftly, sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shouting laugh out by way of greeting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well done, Yellow Beard!" he shouted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shouting, thrust. "Well done, broth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man went reeling back from his thrust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">another stepped into his place. Northrup</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck out, and a man went down. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he could jerk back his spear another</seg><seg type="columnLine">menacing figure had leaped upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup saw and swung his body to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, seeking to avoid the glittering death</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaping out at him. Again he felt a pain like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the searing of white-hot iron, this time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder, and he went down upon one</seg><seg type="columnLine">knee, his teeth set hard, the thought upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that soon or late a man must die, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was well to die like a man. He had lived to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the uttermost, his lips had touched the lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Yahoya; he would not cry out at taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bitter with the sweet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Muyingwa, hard pressed as he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen, and the knife he was wielding now</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove between Northrup and instant death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried to the hilt in the body of the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him. Northrup jerked himself to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, his groping hand sweeping up his fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear, blacker rage than ever before in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart that he had seemed a lesser man than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muyingwa. And before his berserk rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">men fell back, muttering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a great shout from the men at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliff's edge. Northrup, pursuing a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who fled nimbly before him, saw a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms racing to meet him and braced himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">against them. But he saw that they di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided and swept about him, that they must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be Muyingwa's men come at last to the aid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then Northrup felt suddenly weary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crouched down close to the precipice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed that it was all over. Men stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">about and did nothing. Northrup was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive, so he supposed that his side had won</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bloody game of brutes. It had all</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun so suddenly, seeming merely a hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eous dream. It was ending so absurdly</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, still like some frenzied night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mare, with the broken men lying about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes passed by the little knot of idle</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, and he saw that it had not yet ended.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muyingwa still lived, Tiyo lived, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone fought on. Northrup watched them</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They moved back and forth, spear oppos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing spear, the bright points leaping forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerking back, thrusting skilfully, guarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">jealously where death might pay forfeit for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wink of an eyelid. But it seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup that always they drew a litde</seg><seg type="columnLine">near to him, that it was Muyingwa who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forcing the fight, that steadily, but oh, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, he was driving Tiyo back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northrup ran his hand across his dimming</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and the hand came away wet. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a cut across his forehead which puzzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; he had felt no wound there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some one came running to him. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was Yahoya. He marveled at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">look in her eyes. She dropped down beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, her arms about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch them, Yahoya," he said thickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is Muyingwa against Tiyo now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, they were drawing closer. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">there could be no doubt of that. Both men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were wounded, one could not guess how</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly. But both fought savagely, desper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately, knowing that only in death for one if</seg><seg type="columnLine">not for both, could the blood feud end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's Muyingwa's fight!" said Northrup</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. "Can't you see it, Yahoya?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya saw nothing in all the world but</seg><seg type="columnLine">her lover, crouching at her feet, her lover</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded in a dozen places. She sought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer, but he^ voice broke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look at their eyes," Northrup insisted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You can guess the end in a man's eyes at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time like this, Yahoya. Tiyo is just des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate, seeking to postpone the end. Mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yingwa is filled with elation. He has made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise to his gods! Can't you see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yahoya sobbed and knelt, drawing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms tighter about him. On they came,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiyo lunging heavily, but always on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard; Muyingwa, lighter of foot, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright with hard laughter and steely with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatred. On, until they were so close that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahoya and Northrup must move a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the side; on until Tiyo dared take no fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther step backward for fear of a plunge to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death on the rocks below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Muyingwa, calling out loudly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck such a blow as he had not yet struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">The haft of his spear broke against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiyo's right wrist, and his shattered weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">54</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tiyo's fallen one struck the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While men looked on, their mouths agape,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muyingwa sprang forward, only his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted against the knife which Tiyo had</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped from his belt with his left hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As Tiyo's hand went up, Muyingwa's rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it. As Tiyo's sought to drive down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, Muyingwa's fingers shut hard about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wrist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now they struggled man to man, body</seg><seg type="columnLine">to body, their muscles cracking, the sweat</seg><seg type="columnLine">running from them like water, red sweat</seg><seg type="columnLine">across deep cuts. Slowly Tiyo's hand came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, the pointed blade finding its sheath</seg><seg type="columnLine">only in the empty air. Down and down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though Tiyo strove wildly to wrest it away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the fingers which shut like iron talons</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his wrist. And slowly Muyingwa</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced Tiyo back toward the cliff's edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have sworn, Tiyo," panted Muyingwa,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"with my two hands, to cast you straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into Maski! See how I keep my</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men gasped out at what they saw. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin upon Muyingwa's bowed back seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">splitting asunder with the bunching of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles under it; the veins in his arms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead threatened to burst. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce flames in his eyes were undimmed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of failing power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an instant the two struggling forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew still, only the slow swelling of a muscle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hard breathing, telling that they lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strove. But it seemed that strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">was flowing out of Tiyo, fresh strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowing into Muyingwa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly one man bent under the other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron hands. Slowly Tiyo's body twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Muyingwa's fingers commanded; slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muyingwa forced him down to his knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then--there was no slowness now, Mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yingwa's movement being like a flash of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">--Tiyo was swept upward in the other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp as he had before been swung aloft in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northrup's.

But they</seg><seg type="columnLine">took care always that a few old weapons</seg><seg type="columnLine">were found or that a personal enemy of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guide was captured to color the deception.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And when the troops toiled back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dun, palm-shaded village, red-eyed, mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dened with heat, desperate with blacken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing thirst and the hopelessness of the chase,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rabble of anxiously solicitous natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">flanked them and welcomed them with</seg><seg type="columnLine">voluble commiseration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How sad," they exclaimed, "that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brave soldados have labored so long in vain!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet, they thought, is the loot of my broth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er or my uncle or my cousin or my father,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who is supposed to be dead, or my wife's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweetheart still where I can find it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How unutterable that the unspeakables</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the mountains have again escaped!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet, they argued, how fortunate it is for</seg><seg type="columnLine">us that these stupid pigs do not know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the colonels or the generals are even now</seg><seg type="columnLine">at cards with the padre and perhaps will</seg><seg type="columnLine">dine today with the Americanos themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also the old men hobbled along, wagging</seg><seg type="columnLine">their apish heads in seeming pity. Women</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in the door-holes of the thatches, si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent, indifferent, or glided slipperless across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bamboo floors to peer, like cows, above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sills of the window spaces. And every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, in the arms of the people or pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into gaps among them, were star-eyed, smil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing children, suns of hope in a sullen uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse of malice, still pure as the fruit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees. They laughed with the careless joy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of babyhood. Their elders leered inanely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since they knew the value of a mask.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men can not stand this sort of existence</seg><seg type="columnLine">indefinitely. At the end of a year the lack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of amusement, the frightful monotony, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unrelenting climate and the extreme dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">couragement that depressed the garrison</seg><seg type="columnLine">had driven many of them close to madness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some bore on grimly, waiting for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague day when they should be delivered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Others sought refuge in vice, and a few died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain, the lieutenant and the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geon lived in a roomy shack across the plaza.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Life for them was even harder; for anxiety,</seg><seg type="columnLine">official responsibility and the burdens of</seg><seg type="columnLine">administration were added to their other</seg><seg type="columnLine">cares. Paddy was not the least of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubles. But they were as lenient with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as the necessities of discipline allowed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">considering the circumstances under which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they lived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came a time, however, when Lieu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenant Bryant appeared for breakfast one</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning in a mood that said, as plainly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, that his patience was exhausted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Had to put Private Ruff in confinement</seg><seg type="columnLine">last night," he explained. "Howling drunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">again in spite of his promises."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ruff?" queried the captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's that red-headed, big-eared, fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">specked little devil with the innocent, baby-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue eyes. The men call him 'Paddy.' "</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, yes! That's four times in a year.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm afraid we shall have to put him before</seg><seg type="columnLine">a general court pretty soon, unless the med-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ico can cure him. How about it, Scotty?</seg><seg type="columnLine">What's the psychology of it?" With a wink</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Bryant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor, a middle-aged contract</seg><seg type="columnLine">The One Sheep That Was Lost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">surgeon, was, in many respects, an odd mix-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of the Old World and the New. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">real name was Maclaren.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," he drawled as he slowly stirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">his coffee, "I'm no Keeley-cure man and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to me I've had the beggar on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands before. From what I recollect, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think I don't want him again. But as for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the analysis of his case, I'm thinking it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">very simple. He spends his leisure in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">native shacks, a-wandering from one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">t'other, according to fancy. And when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">finds congenial surroundings--and he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">good taste in judging the looks of a brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">lass--he thrones himself on a rice-mat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets bacchantic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mind ye, I'm not condoning the offense,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it might be he's lonesome. And he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deal of thirst and curiosity, which he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimented with for a year till both are</seg><seg type="columnLine">torrid in intensitee. Incidentally he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned to talk Visayan in all its classic</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty, howbeit he did acquire a degraded</seg><seg type="columnLine">dialect of his own language in the stews of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his native land. Consequently-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on, Scotty! Hold on!" laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain. "That's enough. What you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving at is that he's nothing but a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon drunk, but that he may be useful on</seg><seg type="columnLine">account of his knowledge of the local cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toms and this cog-and-ratchet language.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hence, mercy. All right. We'll let it go</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that. But there are some other things</seg><seg type="columnLine">he will have to learn, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was all until the next day. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">about noon, a sentry tapped on the sala</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Prisoner Ruff, sir, wants to talk to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it about?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't know, sir; says it's private."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "H'm!

It's bad</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to have you in garrison where other</seg><seg type="columnLine">men have to do your work for you while</seg><seg type="columnLine">you lie drunk in the guard-house.

I can't do it, Ruff, you'd give out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're no good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's just it, sir," replied the prisoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a pause.

How long will he last?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Bout two weeks, mebbe. It's hard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a deceesion. But the lee tie rascal</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes a strong appeal to the paternal in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinct."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE bay was red and purple with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glow of the setting sun, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny islands far off on the horizon</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose above the sea line, green and blue and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pink, curling their edges up toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">painted clouds, when "D" Company once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more marched quietly into the jungle. Pad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dy was with them, vowing to make good;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the moon sneered at him through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattling canes, the huge palms whetted</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fronds derisively against one another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the breezes laughed in the leaves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everything mocked him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he plodded cheerfully and optimistic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally on in his proper place, and all went</seg><seg type="columnLine">well for three days. Then, in the evening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was tortured with a frightful thirst. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not vino he wanted, though, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were bivouacked upon the summit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a ridge; their haversacks for pillows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">70</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">banana-leaves for beds,^ the moonlight for</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover, and rustling fans to whisper dreams.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The brain-fevering day had yielded to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool night; and as the voices in the shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">timidly ventured forth they slept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only Paddy and the guard were still</seg><seg type="columnLine">awake; the one because none knew in what</seg><seg type="columnLine">form death might be crawling upon them</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the valley, the other because his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned and his tongue was stiff from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torment he suffered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He scooped a hole to accommodate his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hip and so made his earthy bed more com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable. Then he stuffed his hat beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the small of his back and thus eased and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifted his aching body. But no device he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could invent brought either rest or forget-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later he prowled about among his fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows and examined their canteens. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were empty. By the embers of the cook's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire was a huge can of boiled water, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still scalding hot. It would not be cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">for many hours. Yet he filled his tin cup</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it and lay down again to wait, until it</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be cold enough to drink. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere in the darkness below, a dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">howled, though the tom-toms that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned the country of their approach were</seg><seg type="columnLine">long since hushed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wot's that?" he wondered. "Some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">cornin'?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sentry paused in his monotonous</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, listening; and Paddy remained mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionless, gazing steadily into the black void</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath. Suddenly even that seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fade as he looked into it. He lost all sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of everything. Thirst, the dog, danger and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hardness of the ground became of no</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. He was asleep and dreamed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was immersed in a great lake, clear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">comforting. He drank until he could hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more, but yet he was unsatisfied. Pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently a monstrous beast came down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore and wallowed, then changed to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spreading sheet of flame so that the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface boiled. He strangled, for he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">drank the fire and it seethed in his throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat up choking and reached for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cup. Either he or the man on post had</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked it over while he slept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've simply got to have ut," he groaned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"or something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The barking had stopped, but a point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light flickered far down the hillside. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not noticed it before. Then it disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm goin' after 't. S'help me, I got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do ut! I can't stand ut no more!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He slid noiselessly into the underbrush.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alert, and with the utmost caution, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">groped his way toward where the gleam had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been. Soon he came into a clearing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there he discovered a well - made hut.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the raised flap that marked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front he saw a young woman within, seat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed upon her heels, sorting metal buttons by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aid of a feeble flame that danced in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass of coconut-oil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without the least sign of surprise or any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other emotion, she paused in her work and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at him appraisingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On watch," concluded Paddy, "an' sort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in' out buttons fer makin' the ends o' tin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can cartridges."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Sus Marie!" she exclaimed at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tubig!" he whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman arose softly and brought him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a drink in a dripping coconut-shell from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jar that stood near the window-gap. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">called for more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Vino? Anisette?'' she suggested cun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ningly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paddy was not insensible of a warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">that welled up within him, but he was op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">timistic. Besides, one glass wouldn't hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he argued, and he needed it, or thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did, which is the same thing to those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who wish it to be. So he sinned again, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was late the next afternoon when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">awoke. The woman was smoking a cigar</seg><seg type="columnLine">contentedly, apparently unaware even of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his presence. She was huddled upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor fussing with a little fire in a box of</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, beside which was a pot of rice ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the cooking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there were now other visitors; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">two barefooted, slippered men crouched in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a corner, whose enormous, straw hats were</seg><seg type="columnLine">inscribed "Zona 16," in big, red characters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the shoulders of their loose, white coats</seg><seg type="columnLine">were red straps burdened with tin insignia;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and along the seams of their baggy trousers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">red, flannel stripes. Their buttons were</seg><seg type="columnLine">small and brassy, each crudely embossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a single star.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two gu - gu generals," noted Paddy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken immovable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Little by little the memory of the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">before came out of the dark fog in the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his mind. The details of the present be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came vivid and real, and he wondered what</seg><seg type="columnLine">time it was. Then he realized that if his</seg><seg type="columnLine">The One Sheep That Was Lost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">71</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">company were near, these two rascals in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner would not be sitting there. Evident-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly the captain had given up searching for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him or had gone in the wrong direction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was more probable. A shudder trick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">led down his spine like a drop of cold water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I sure am up against it this time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair!" he sighed to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman set the pot of rice upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, and brought cigarettes for the gener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">als. It was plain that they had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">there long, for as they smoked she de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribed the manner of Paddy's coming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Said one, a surly, ill-natured brute not</seg><seg type="columnLine">good to look upon--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is, no doubt, a Mason and a heretic."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other raised his palms, shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and was grave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What shall we do with him?" asked this</seg><seg type="columnLine">one with a deprecatory little smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first shrugged indifferently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can not be bothered with prisoners,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he declared tonelessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second bowed submissively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True," he agreed. "But who knows?</seg><seg type="columnLine">We may use him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then, at least, since he has awakened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will secure him. Woman, fetch me a cord!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Paddy had no wish to be bound.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's only wan way out," thought he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll have t' join 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He arose leisurely, feigning unconcern.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, leaning back against the wall, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands in his pockets and his sodden blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes looking from one to the other, he spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them in their own tongue, "in all its</seg><seg type="columnLine">classic beauty," augmented as it is with</seg><seg type="columnLine">borrowed Spanish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen!" he bade them.

Do I not know you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes in every bamboo, that I could not go</seg><seg type="columnLine">along a dozen barras or cry for help, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">live? I could not leave if I would. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not bind me. And there is more. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have something to say to Pachico."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Exactly what he had to communicate was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not at all clear, however, even to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ill-tempered one seemed about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak, but the mild one checked him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sign.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is this you have to say to Pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chico?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There will be great honor for you both</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he knows. Surely it would be unfortun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate if one with a secret should be hindered</seg><seg type="columnLine">or fail to arrive. Pachico would hear of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would be offended. I can not tell, now. "</seg><seg type="columnLine">Over the face of the surly one spread a</seg><seg type="columnLine">look that none who knows the native can</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistake. As the woman glided soundlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, he sprang to his feet, cat-like, his naked</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolo quivering in his grasp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shall I let this spotted-faced white man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hair like hemp and eyes like water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">defy me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The merciful one said gently--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait, my friend, till tomorrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly," he said. "But why are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">unwilling that he should speak only with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pachico? Is it because you would know his</seg><seg type="columnLine">business for yourself?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rabid one settled upon his heels like</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who is felled, his face inscrutable. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he of the deprecatory little smile seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to notice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paddy sat down, cross-legged, upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Phew!" he breathed softly to himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Pretty close! I wasn't lookin' fer that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither. I see how ut is. Not extry good</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends. Got him that time; Softy did, too."</seg><seg type="columnLine">His brow was damp but he dared not</seg><seg type="columnLine">wipe it. This was no time to show weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. But he said no more; for to take ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage of a point secured, even to signify</seg><seg type="columnLine">perception of the fact, might pique the pride</seg><seg type="columnLine">of even the mild one. Then he would sure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly die. But his wits were busy, exceeding-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly busy, and he wrenched them free from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grip of the liquor to evolve some plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">for escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Night was descending, and soon the wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man returned, puffing her vile weed. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast but a glance at Paddy, and though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have surprised her to see him living,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she did not show it. She brought the sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per from the fire, and the placid one invited</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to eat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tomorrow," he said, "you shall report</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Pachico."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is better tonight," replied Paddy, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">too insistently, "since it might occur that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be bitten by a snake or die of air in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart while I sleep. Can you not, ami-</seg><seg type="columnLine">go," he addressed the sullen one, "despatch</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to Pachico?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">72</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the brute refused to be conciliated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good!

Paddy had guessed a situ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation between these two, a possibility,, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was striving for the facts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have no soldiers!" blurted the blood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirsty one, a general caught unawares be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause he despised his enemy. Then he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trap and grew turgid with rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gentle one laughed a very little, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most with contempt, and shrugged his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders. But he eyed his companion like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lynx, not once relaxing his watchfulness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he spoke to Paddy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have great intelligence, amigo," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I will tell you something. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend, here, is a famous general. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">does nothing for Pachico and much for him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. For that the chief will give him no</seg><seg type="columnLine">men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Diablo!" exclaimed the other, appalled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What importance if I tell this man," de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded the calm one softly, but tense, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard, as he pretended to misunderstand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"since you kill him tomorrow?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke again to Paddy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Indeed, a few of my friends desire that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he should soon succeed Pachico."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over the pot of rice the hand of the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovered, trembling. The woman was light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the wick in the glass of oil; and as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakly came to life, Paddy shivered. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was chilled, like one who waits a promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">specter or dreads momentarily its cold touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the darkness. But he understood, now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or at least appreciated the certainty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what impended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As if an intuition forced his speech, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">pledging allegiance he asked--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you have many other friends?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Very many, amigo," the cool one an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered, "you are quick to understand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sullen one ate of the food in his palm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then stood. He did not even reach for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon, for the tranquil one was clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready. He looked at the woman, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">back was toward him as she tinkered at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire; at Paddy, oppressed like a watcher who</seg><seg type="columnLine">does not look up in the dark hour of an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other; and then at his wily, tigerish foe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who, Judas-like, had dipped with him into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the pot of rice and now attentively enjoyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the agony of his prey. At last he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutely to the door; stared long into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness, and left them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He at the rice arose and stepped to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window. Upon the sill he set the feeble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickering flame the woman had provided,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and remained there a moment. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned with it, a smile on his face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">something in his eyes that turned the heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For this I brought him here," was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paddy turned away that the creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">might not read his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Holal Americano! There was mastery</seg><seg type="columnLine">now in the voice, not craft, and Paddy rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ognized it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me your business. I, myself, am</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pachico! Will you have proof?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is enough." Then, desperately but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with head erect, he uttered whatever his</seg><seg type="columnLine">misery prompted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I came here, as I and the woman have</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, of my own desire.

Seven months have I</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The listener's accursed features reflected</seg><seg type="columnLine">no thought, no emotion. But his cunning</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding would clutch the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaw, and miss not a single word, though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">spelt life or death for Paddy Ruff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must speak truth," hummed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleader's thoughts, so he lied with the facts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have no love for their cells nor they</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me. When I go back it must be with</seg><seg type="columnLine">your people or I shall not return. I have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme for effecting this, and I will destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">my enemies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other looked evilly upon him, suspi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciously, treacherously, as was to be expected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen! I know what has passed here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He who has gone out will not come back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lamp in the window showed no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a candle among the trees, but it shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a long journey. You have many friends.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They saw, and read it for a signal, since it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was for that you brought him here. So will'</seg><seg type="columnLine">it be with me, too, if I displease you. Is it</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so? Therefore I shall obey your com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have spoken of a way to go back</seg><seg type="columnLine">as one of us, to the camp of the Americanos.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wot'll I say? Wot'll I say?" implored</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paddy of himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The One Sheep That Was Lost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lurched to his feet and walked slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the water-jar. As he drank he imagined</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could feel the other's gaze upon him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Up from his mud-stiffened canvas leggings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">over khaki breeches and dark, blue-flannel</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt it burned, till it scorched his pallid</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Then an idea came; not quite formed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, yet outlined clearly enough for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned back quickly to Pachico and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled at him confidingly. Whenever he</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled, his red head seemed like a sun of</seg><seg type="columnLine">goodwill and his eyes like wells of trust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will show you how to take the rifles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Americanos and all their stores; the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">chests of salmon, of meats, of cartridges, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes, of clothing and of money that are</seg><seg type="columnLine">piled high in their cuartel; and you can not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fail."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cupidity, the lust of power and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood that burned in the monster's breast</seg><seg type="columnLine">flamed into his cheeks. He let himself an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticipate, for a moment, what all this meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. As for the white stranger, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much intelligence, he should certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">make no trouble when he ceased to be use-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful. No chances must be taken with such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he. The little smile played significantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you, my friend," he insinuated al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most effectionately, "how shall I then hon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">or you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Paddy had not sat upon the mats of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sogod so many times in vain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is true, of course," he said, "that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a motive and something to gain. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want neither riches nor authority. I ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even that you give me back my rifle, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you promise me pay. I shall be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent if I am never more imprisoned. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing this for what they have done to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is for hate, nothing more. Let us dismiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman so that I may show you how it</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be done."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was reclining upon the floor, dozing</seg><seg type="columnLine">contentedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go you to Dolores!" commanded Pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chico. "Tell my generals that I return to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow. Say nothing of this man.

You</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprehend?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Senorl" she mumbled, and slipped away</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the gloom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is thus," continued Paddy. "We will</seg><seg type="columnLine">send a letter to their thick-headed captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and proffer our surrender and that of all our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">army. We will write that upon a stated</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, let us say the fourth from the letter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we shall be upon the plaza of Malavista.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There we will lay down our arms. He will</seg><seg type="columnLine">come with his whole army, surely all but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few, for he knows we are many, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there may be a splendid ceremony. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we shall not be there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He will march with a loud noise of can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen and bayonet by the easy trail, for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the way they do. We will go by the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">route to Sogod, and we must be there when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enemy leave. When we can no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear the dogs bark at their coming, then we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will run to the storehouse. The guard must</seg><seg type="columnLine">flee or die. There I will indicate what is</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled and what is empty, where are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases of arms and where the money, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can quickly retreat to the mountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On the way we will destroy them from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the summits above the road, in a place from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which there is no escape, with their own ri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fles. I shall secure my vengeance, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">may give me what else you will. I shall be</seg><seg type="columnLine">content and you shall be master."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But our troops have tried such strategy</seg><seg type="columnLine">before," objected Pachico, "and the Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">canos have always eluded us or done some</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer thing that none but pigs would think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It is for this reason," explained Paddy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You do not know their ways nor their</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of fighting. For example, has it</seg><seg type="columnLine">not happened, when you have rushed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with the bolo so quickly they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not use their guns, that they have thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">these down and beaten your men with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fists? If you had known, you could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevented this and killed them all when</seg><seg type="columnLine">often you destroyed but a few. Yet your</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers are brave as any in all the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Let us take a short time and first teach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the army how those people fight and what</seg><seg type="columnLine">their tactics are. Also, when we strike, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can tell you from the signs about the bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">racks what is their design when they de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">part. Thus there will be no error, since we</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall know as much as they, and we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">not lose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will think of this," Pachico said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"To-morrow I will hold a council. Let us</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "A cigarette, I beg of you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You have it," the general answered, pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducing a package hastily and graciously, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">might an Oriental prince for an honored</seg><seg type="columnLine">guest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">74</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UPON the following morning they</seg><seg type="columnLine">set out to join the army. This con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted of seven generals subordinate</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Pachico, many colonels, and a progress-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ively increasing number of lieutenant-colo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nels, majors, captains and lieutenants. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">all there were about two hundred; but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">predominance of officers was of slight con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sideration, since there was little semblance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of organization. Rank merely determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">the share of pillage each received.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day was well advanced when Paddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">was led before the owners of this opera</seg><seg type="columnLine">boujje, and they glared at him exultingly, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">real American captive, as they lolled be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the coco-palms and idled the steam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hours away with monte and cigarettes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not proper that officers such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they should sit with those of lower grade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for those were only fighters, and generals</seg><seg type="columnLine">have greater things to do. So, farther back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shady grove, the majors, the captains</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the subalterns loafed and gambled like</seg><seg type="columnLine">their betters, except that the stakes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller; while here and there was only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldado, a link in the chain that signaled</seg><seg type="columnLine">news across the island by tom-tom, fire and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sturdy runner, or watched the trails from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">perch in the miry rice-fields or the top of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The generals scowled at Paddy; and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since their lord was silent, they turned again</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bet on the ace of baslos. But when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tired of the game or the bankers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">won their all, Pachico called them to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the siesta hour had come and gone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and told them, in flowery words, the his-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory and the offer of the intelligent Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is the name of this foreigner?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">croaked an ancient whose lineaments were</seg><seg type="columnLine">seamed like a monkey's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is one not hard to pronounce," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief. "It is Paddy R-ruff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you that Paddy," another asked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"who visits so much with our people of So-</seg><seg type="columnLine">god?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am," admitted he, seating himself on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grass among them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is as I thought. He is that one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom the priest has spoken. I, myself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have often seen him in the Iiendas, drink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I also," said the old man. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">know of him favorably. We have even</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked with him in Sogod."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But another spoke more cautiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is well planned," conceded he, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">how are we to know that the infidels will</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the doors unlocked?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is thus," submitted Paddy. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">think the guard sufficient. They have never</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the locks, for the doors are heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hard to close. Yet, if they do, I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the keys are hung."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But they may not go out," another ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That we can see from the heights. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">they will, for the captain will desire the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great glory of this surrender."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And our friend the Americano, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">does he desire?" one other asked. "Shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">he have a command?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As the council wish," replied Paddy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising his palms and shrugging. "But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am content to be simply a drill-master; or,</seg><seg type="columnLine">better still, our leader's minister of war.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Otherwise, some captain might be jealous</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one so newly come should be so soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">promoted, and an accident to me might</seg><seg type="columnLine">then deprive you of your victory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had no mind to follow a certain Miguel</seg><seg type="columnLine">recently suspected of ambition, yet he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sired to hold some sort of dignified position</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he might not be slain in mere contempt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To have a minister of war was pleasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them, for they had heard of such an offi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cer who, in Spain, was a grand man. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">to none had it ever been related that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">held a post in battle, nor was there any</seg><seg type="columnLine">precedent by which to establish his share</seg><seg type="columnLine">of spoils.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Therefore, until now, no one had wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">a place among them so void of either glory</seg><seg type="columnLine">or remuneration, even though it doubtless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly commanded high respect. Consequently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the white man, who craved no fame and</seg><seg type="columnLine">coveted no profit, since the Americanos are</seg><seg type="columnLine">all rich, would be satisfied with a portfolio,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was excellent, they agreed, that the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mander should have him upon his staff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Pachico, who had said no word</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout the council, approved, since it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in his thoughts to do this very thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then let us begin at once. And if, to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow, you will give me pens, ink and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper, I will write a manual of drill for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captains, whom I, myself, will instruct</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A trifle dubiously they acquiesced, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that time on, the order of their days</seg><seg type="columnLine">was drill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They raided helpless villages no more, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned nor looted. Only they still exacted</seg><seg type="columnLine">The One Sheep That Was Lost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tribute of money, provisions and cloth, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">these were necessary. They made their</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters, for greater comfort, in a barrio of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolores, where Paddy was given a shack to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, as became a minister of war, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were a bamboo bed, a chair, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, rectangular table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They posted guards on the paths and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hilltops, and lookouts watched by day</seg><seg type="columnLine">and by night to see that nothing disturbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the generals, and, especially, the minister</seg><seg type="columnLine">of war. He was assigned, also, a captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">for aide, to fetch and to carry; for it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">better, they said, that he, a white man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">should not be exposed too much to the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">by day or the jungle mists at night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thanked them very heartily, pretend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing not to understand; and hour after hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread out a kind of "school of the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany" on many sheets of paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he trained them and wrote for them</seg><seg type="columnLine">during all those wearying sittings not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make soldiers of the ruffians, but to gain</seg><seg type="columnLine">time and to win their confidence. The suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess of the plan that had suggested itself so</seg><seg type="columnLine">hazily at first, required not only the faith of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his captors but also the cooperation of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">countrymen. For that reason he had pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed the letter of surrender, which, he in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended, should be solely a device to carry a</seg><seg type="columnLine">message of his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great difficulty was to write one</seg><seg type="columnLine">communication within another in such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way as to be detected by his captain but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not by the insurrectos.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he labored at his little table over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessons for his masters, this problem formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his principle study. He considered and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected various schemes. Eventually he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered that "Big Bill" Schindel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Teaser" Ritter had plotted most reprehen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible things under the very noses of the po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lice, with the help of an invisible ink com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounded of onion-juice mixed with milk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. The knowledge had nearly cost him</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear, for he had carried some of the mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sives before the double nature of the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">respondence had been discovered. He de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided that it would be easy to apprise the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain of the two-fold structure of the let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, and concerned himself with securing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ingredients.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To this end he shivered one day as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood on the parade with Pachico, watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the drill. The fellow expressed an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">xiety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is nothing," Paddy explained, casting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a woful look at the skies as he hunched his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shoulders and chattered his teeth. "The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">night-dews give me rigors at times, which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stay in my bones till the sun brings them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out. If only I had onions and the milk that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is sold in cans, I should never be troubled;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or so, at least, it was when I lay in the jail</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Sogod."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " 'Sus!" exclaimed Pachico. "If that is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all, you shall have them. I will ask the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">padre in Sogod for onions, which he can pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cure from the heretics there; for they are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on excellent terms, as you know. And, as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for the milk in cans, the Spaniard here in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dolores shall furnish all you require."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Indeed, these remarkable essentials to a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cure were not long in arriving; and though</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there is no explanation of the fact, either</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">empiric or rational, yet it is undeniable that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when they had been received Paddy quaked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">no more. He also took pains to write, each</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">day, only as much as could be learned upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the next; for he knew they would soon lose</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">patience, and he felt that a manuscript re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pudiated would confess the looseness of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hold upon them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   As a matter of fact, in about three weeks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the steps began to lag, the hands to slouch</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and their enthusiasm to cool perceptibly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Paddy went at once to Pachico, whose zeal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was waning like his men's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "I come to you," he said, "as your minis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ter of war, to announce that the army is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">prepared."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "It is well," approved the general, more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cordial than he had been for some time be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fore. "Also I am sensible of much improve-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment in their art. Tonight I will consult</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the council."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Paddy returned to his shack and stretch-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ed himself upon the bamboo bed. His aide</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sprawled upon a rice-mat under the win-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dow-hole, asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But the unhappy prisoner took no heed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of him. The moment had come when he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">must make the last move between himself</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and his own kind. It was only a little way,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but if he fell there would be none to raise</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   He was afraid. So cunningly had he plot-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ted, so skilfully had he dissembled, so severe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had been the strain, that the very prospect</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of fulfilment conjured up doubts and called</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">forth terrors from his imagination. Reac-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion like this was inevitable. In an uncer-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•	tain way he knew it and that the mood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would pass. Yet he had baited a trap with</seg><seg type="columnLine">76</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a massacre, to lure devils, and wagered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life on an untried gin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But they'll kill me anyhow," he rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soned in his own poor dialect, "an' I got t'</seg><seg type="columnLine">do ut. It's a chanst."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Four-flushin' I am," he continued in si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent deliberation, "an' if any one calls me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm gone. Cut off me hands an' me feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mebbe, an' bury me t' the neck in a hill of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE siesta hour was over. His as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistant stirred, then awoke, and seat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed himself in the doorway, smoking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking out at nothing. But Paddy re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained where he was, his hands behind his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruddy, unkempt head, his ankles crossed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an attitude of ease, his blue eyes dim with</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry, trying to predict and to provide</seg><seg type="columnLine">against such difficulties as he had not yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreseen. In the meantime, one by one, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes fluttered by and night slowly ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced upon them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rice-pots were steaming and the army</seg><seg type="columnLine">clustered round them, while the yellows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greens and the pinks of sunset dulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a copper glow. He heard the evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">babble; sometimes a deep-chested grunt, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shrill, falsetto argument that invariably</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended in a high-pitched, even-toned, long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathed "ah-h-h" that meant contempt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">derision or a challenge, as one chose. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were laughter and muttering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The native went out for the eight-o'clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal. Paddy forsook his couch, with sweat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing palms and chill brow, to explore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaps in the nipa walls for spying eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, with trembling fingers, he lighted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">primitive lamp, tiptoed softly with it to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, and cast the die.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First, he opened a can of milk and drank</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly all of it. Then he crushed an onion</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the residue. He added a dash of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strained the mixture, as best he could,</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a sea-shell which he used for a paper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With this unusual fluid he indited a note</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his captain. It was not very long, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered less than one side of a sheet of pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per. He made several copies, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were dry, laid them all, blank sides up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on top of the pile from which he had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The words could not be seen, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least in the faint, wavering light of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afterward he washed the shell, but left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the empty tin and the refuse to testify that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he had eaten, in case the observant warden</seg><seg type="columnLine">should manifest solicitous curiosity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now, with good India ink of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, he wrote an offer of capitulation on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clean surface of the uppermost page, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">very fair Visayan, free from hidden mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing or doubt-inspiring mark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He worked swiftly, and when his inmate</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned, appeared to be dozing again. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">master had finished his sena, the latter re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported, and had summoned the seven to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. The ministro was expected, also.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paddy arose and obeyed, with a primal</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayer to an unknown God welling up in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saluted the seven gravely, and sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned himself beside Pachico's chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I return to you, my General," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a profound bow, "what is left of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">writing materials; for since the drill is fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished, I need them no more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So naturally as to make it seem quite ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cidental, he laid his papers upon a pile in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of Pachico. He retained only the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted despatch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gracias!" murmured the chief. "While</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were coming we discussed the campaign</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more. Have you, perhaps, something</seg><seg type="columnLine">further to recommend?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing. We are ready. I have also</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared the letter, to save your excellency</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble, as a ministro should. If it is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">good there are the means before you to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you will."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Read it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paddy, who had remained standing, shift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed his weight to one foot and raised the</seg><seg type="columnLine">document in both hands while he read:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">To the Commandante Militar residing in Sogod.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Very Respected Senor:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Believing that the welfare of our beloved country</seg><seg type="columnLine">so demands, and that peace under the powerful Uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted States is better than a hopeless warfare for our</seg><seg type="columnLine">independence, we hereby propose freely, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">with painful sorrow, to surrender upon the plaza of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Malavista on the afternoon of the fourth day that</seg><seg type="columnLine">follows the present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Most obediently we kiss your hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He passed it to Pachico, who scrutinized</seg><seg type="columnLine">it closely, his eyes illumined as if to burn a</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret from the very pulp. So, too, each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seven scanned it and a few glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">casually at the other side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it sufficient?" inquired Paddy. "Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall another be written?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will serve.

"We know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely, that the Americanos do not kill if</seg><seg type="columnLine">that can be avoided. Yet, if we all sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the enterprise fails, it may not after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward be convenient for us to visit Sogod,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and our families may be incommoded."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is true," agreed Paddy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, it was not open to argument that</seg><seg type="columnLine">any instructions he wished to give his cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain would have to be in English; and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be accomplished only in his signature.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had reviewed all possible obstacles to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this during his meditations. He had con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trived a method to meet every emergency</seg><seg type="columnLine">pertaining to it. Not until he was sure he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could warn his own officers had he conceded</seg><seg type="columnLine">his readiness for the undertaking. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped for this particular protest, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared to make it himself. But it pleased</seg><seg type="columnLine">him more to have another interpose. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stooped to adjust a lacing upon his tattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes to hide his satisfaction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let Pachico," he resumed, "whose name</seg><seg type="columnLine">they already know, alone ratify it for him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self and his forces; and that the act may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">official, let it be attested by the minister of</seg><seg type="columnLine">war. Such is the mode of authorities."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You, Americano! Carrambal No! Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">name will provoke distrust. Do you tell us</seg><seg type="columnLine">they will believe that you, a deserter in time</seg><seg type="columnLine">of war, would involuntarily give yourself up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to death?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man who hurled this bomb con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered a moment, and then, as the minister,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had expected this, was about to speak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a light seemed suddenly to break upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pig!" he grunted. "There is'more in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this than we suspect. Either you and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have planned this thing in a way we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">not perceived, or you blunder. It is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, for you have great intelligence. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">eso! It is a hoax! Americano, is it not so?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">For an instant Paddy nearly staggered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The little smile hovered upon Pachico's lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you not understand," he replied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that the Americanos have stupid ideas</seg><seg type="columnLine">about such things? For example, among</seg><seg type="columnLine">your soldiers are a few who have been taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">by them and then released. Nor have I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard that they have executed a deserter in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this war. Will they not suppose that I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of their beliefs since I was once as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are? They will say, 'He has induced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">them to come in, for he prefers our prison</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the high places of the Philippines, pun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishment in his own land to banishment for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. And he hopes, by this, to atone for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his crime.' So will they think and thus will</seg><seg type="columnLine">they say. You are wrong, as you will see if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you reflect upon it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Indeed," said Pachico, "he speaks in</seg><seg type="columnLine">good sense. If our scouts at any point de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tect a danger, we can still retire even at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very town. 1 will yet try this.

All he craved of Heaven, now, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked questioningly from one to the other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that the end might be sudden and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of it merciful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he had unconsciously appealed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their greed when argument would not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved them.

The bitter resentment they</seg><seg type="columnLine">nursed against Bassett who had ejected</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from Happy Camp and against all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest who had consented to that ejection</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazed into a sort of savagery, a hatred of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own breed which mocked and tantal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized and ostracized them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every man of that breed bound inward</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a vision before his eyes and a hope in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his heart.

Without</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifting eyes to their companions of the trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">who passed, met, repassed and oftentimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">jostled them, they plodded, pariahs of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">race, down the frozen surface of Long Lake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Near Long Lake's foot a string of seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleds drawn by swift dog-teams, and going</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, overtook them.

On the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main trail just at the dip to the ice</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulked the Linderman Restaurant run by</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Hunt-Pack</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Flambald.

In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctively Cantine and Blera increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">their pace as they made for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a crowd about the door. Can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tine went to push through and suddenly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coiled.

He seemed astounded that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got across untouched. He looked back</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his shoulder uncertainly, half paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went on again toward the tables. Bas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sett had never moved a muscle. Only Can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tine could see the derisive profile of his nose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheek and mouth as he leaned against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside wall, and the sight awoke in Jose</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer premonitions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nevertheless he boldly handed Blera into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chair and waited for some one to take his</seg><seg type="columnLine">order. No one came. Jose beckoned mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, but the waiters were always busy. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded, but they never came. In the fury</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his hunger Jose leaped up and rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to the plank desk where Flambald took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the money for the waiters' checks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here!" he flared. "We're famished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and your waiters are a lot of dummies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Send some one round with grub."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flambald, a man of colossal and un -</seg><seg type="columnLine">healthy girth, looked at him over the plank</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You go to condemnation!" he bellowed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You aren't eating here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why?

Jose si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lently beckoned Blera and slunk out again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the door-step lounged Bassett, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jose turned in the trail to curse him futile-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. He knew better than to try any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">restaurant. Bassett had passed the word.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His receptions would be all the same. Also</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew better than to try force. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had his lesson from that up by timberline.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Besides, Blera's hand was on his arm, fear-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fully dragging him on down Linderman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">frozen bosom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus began a grim game in which Bas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sett was persecution personified, a Nemesis</seg><seg type="columnLine">unshakable. He passed them on Lake Lin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derman, welcomed them at Bennett Post,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and once more showed them the tail of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sled halfway down to West Arm on Ben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nett Lake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night they spent much like the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceding one, feeding a gigantic fire, drinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">inconceivable quantities of hot water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gnawing mangy dried salmon purchased at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Stick Indian teepee on Lake Bennett's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thenceforward Bassett's hand as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand of every other man was against</seg><seg type="columnLine">them up the chain of lakes.

In the lonely</seg><seg type="columnLine">expanse he knew the spot where was life and</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm teepees and food.

Cantine had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">there and he knew, and up the Takhini's</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth ice he pressed at a furious pace, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast instinct of him yearning for food and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the human side of him yearning for a place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he might without dread of contume-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly take on again the status of the white.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jose's sentiments were in a degree re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flected in his companion.

All</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon they held on-for it and at night</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung suddenly to the right into its spruce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fringed mouth. Yonder by the fringe of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spruce on the low bench-land was the site</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Tutchi's Village, but to Cantine's aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished eyes there glowed no teepee fires be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the black trunks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Blazes!" he exclaimed in alarm as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">surveyed the bare bench-land.

In that moment of non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery of the village the inimical wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept close to her.

Also</seg><seg type="columnLine">he held in his hand a generous slab of pilot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bread, and this it was which, cramming his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth, rendered his speech so inarticulate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wildly leading the race, the bread in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hand and Blera's frozen gantlet in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, he hurtled them over the snows be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the spruce trees and banged them</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his cabin doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At their advent five wolf-dogs leaped up</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarling from their rest beside the stove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lie down!" gurgled Cantine's and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blera's rescuer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He kicked the dogs soundly in the ribs</seg><seg type="columnLine">till they retreated into the huge empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood-box that stood behind the stove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't like the brutes inside," he mum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled, still wrestling convulsively to get rid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gagging pilot-bread, "but it's a case</seg><seg type="columnLine">of have to keep them inside or get them</seg><seg type="columnLine">eaten whole.

The yellow light flooding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main room showed it to be built of the cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomary spruce logs chinked with moss and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plastered with mud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The floor was of rough-hewn slabs. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">slabs, too, but a little better smoothed, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rude table upon which supper was</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread. The table stood under the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">which instead of glass for a light boasted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">square of golden-brown moose-skin rubbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">so smooth as to be almost transparent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon the opposite wall was a bunk also</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed of slabs. The Yukon stove stood at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end, and it, with the wood-box behind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed the furnishings of the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of the empty wood-box the huskies</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised their heads and growled so ominously</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Blera's and Jose's movements that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two ran the last few steps across the floor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut the door of the back room with a bang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The back room was but a logged-in an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nex to the main room and without window</seg><seg type="columnLine">or door. A bunk constituted its only fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nishing, and it appeared to be used as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">store-room, for grub-bags and odds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends were piled neatly in its corners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blera set the candle on a pile of sacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ferreted out the dunnage-bag from un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the bunk. Its lashings were loose, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she tumbled the contents out on the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">where each could pick what was needed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rapid run from the river to the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the genial atmosphere of the cabin it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self had somewhat warmed their blood as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as partly thawed their mail-like gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments. Hastily they ripped off the clammy</seg><seg type="columnLine">parkas, mackinaws and woolens and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">the process of replacing them with dry ones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the most part Blera dressed like Jose</seg><seg type="columnLine">in arctic underwear, flannel shirt, German</seg><seg type="columnLine">socks and moccasins, but when it came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer garments she searched in the heart of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disorderly pile on the floor for the wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's things the owner of the cabin had</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally she fished them out, a buckskin</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist and a mackinaw skirt with a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced plaid pattern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The waist went on like any waist, but at</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of the skirt Blera's breath whistled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her throat. Her face convulsed in an ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">palling discovery.

"Lousy?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Jose, it's the same! Here's the band</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather sewn on to keep the sheath-knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">from wearing it and the hooks and eyes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">copper wire on the vent.

"We're trapped, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bassett's done it.

He stopped short in his furious</seg><seg type="columnLine">passion. "We got to do something. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to do it mighty sudden.

Your king</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be greater than all other earthly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rulers, for surely the home of the gods must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be like this city."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kamas smiled, but made no answer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After his own first involuntary exclamation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valgard strove mightily to appear unim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed. He was older than Ragnarr's</seg><seg type="columnLine">father and had not traveled for nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now they came to a stone quay and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kamas bade them disembark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your goods will be safe enough here," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "for none but the king's household</seg><seg type="columnLine">use this landing and it is well guarded."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke truly. No sooner had the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailors set foot on the stone steps than a file</seg><seg type="columnLine">of spearmen appeared and ordered them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand. But, at a sign from Kamas, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer bowed and led off his men as quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was now dark, and as they took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paved road leading up from the water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights flashed out in all parts of the city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Outlined against the glow, a huge wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">loomed like a cliff before them. No cressets</seg><seg type="columnLine">flared on the parapet, no lighted loopholes</seg><seg type="columnLine">starred the black bulk of tower and curtain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bastion. Nor was there the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of gate or gateway when the Northmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, unchallenged, to the end of the paved</seg><seg type="columnLine">way; only the solid wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Kamas turned to the left and led</seg><seg type="columnLine">them along the foot of the wall, which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a score of paces, came to an end. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to the right, four paces inward, a turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the right again, and the Northmen found</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves following their guide down an</seg><seg type="columnLine">alley barely wide enough for two armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">men or a loaded pack-horse, with the wall on</seg><seg type="columnLine">either hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the darkness before them</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed to a yellow glare of torchlight, out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lining blackly the stout bars of a metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">grating barring the way. At the same time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stir and rustle above and to the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew Ragnarr's dazzled eyes upward to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform of the outer wall. There the glint</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the Grip of the Minotaur</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">99</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of helmets and arrow-heads told how ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the Trojan archery to riddle the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shielded sides of the Northmen, packed</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless in the brightly lit alley below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well trapped!" growled Valgard appre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciatively, as he tried to shift his broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">shield to his right arm without letting go</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his long spear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Kamas spoke a word in the Trojan</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue, the grating was swung wide by</seg><seg type="columnLine">unseen hands, and they passed round the</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle of the inner wall and entered the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the left a broad street opened out</seg><seg type="columnLine">before them; to the right rose a tall, white</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here you must leave your weapons,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Kamas, "for this is the Temple of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mother. I myself shall see to it that your</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms are safe, Prince Ragnarr, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular that mighty sword, which must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the gift of some god."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Ragnarr answered:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look more closely, friend Kamas, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will see that my scabbard is empty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I do not doubt your good faith, but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword is indeed the gift of a god, who im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed on my race, his descendants, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">command that the blade should never</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave our kindred, even for a moment;</seg><seg type="columnLine">otherwise our house and people should</seg><seg type="columnLine">perish. I left it behind, therefore, with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">foster-brother, whom I ordered to quit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last boat when you told us of your custom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As we pulled up-stream, I saw my men row</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from the ship and take him back to it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying the sword with him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is wise to obey the commands of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gods," said Kamas, "but you could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusted me, my prince."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So saying, he led on through a narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughfare past the face of the temple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">till they came to its entrance. A broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairway led up to a brilliantly lighted en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance, flanked by pikemen, drawn up on</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side of the stairs, and archers at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through this doorway they passed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a broad court, flagged with great close-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitting slabs of polished stone. Iron rings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">set into some of these, hinted at trap-doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading to vaults below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The temple, lighted so well without, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark within. A solitary torch gleamed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very back of the single court which</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed the interior and shone full on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of a great statue of bronze, repre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">senting a tall and majestic woman, clad in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeping robes but bare-bosomed. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitered crown adorned her head, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were two great amethysts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kamas prostrated himself and the North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men followed his example, Valgard mutter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that it was well to placate the gods of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">country where one hoped to tarry safely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that he called his own gods to witness</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was no derogation of their majesty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arising, Kamas pointed to the low and</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad stone altar before the goddess, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlines barely visible in the gloom, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which lay many faintly glimmering objects.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These are the arms of the common mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chants," he said. "But yours shall be</seg><seg type="columnLine">better cared for."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stooping, he pressed one of the stones in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side of the altar. It turned on its cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, revealing a cavernous opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I pray you, let your men lay their</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons here," he said, and Ragnarr spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few words of command in his native tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Readily the sailors complied, after which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kamas led them out through the great en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance and down the road back of the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, to the broad street which led to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">citadel from the western gate. This street</seg><seg type="columnLine">was full of Trojans, taking the air and wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing till their houses, heated like ovens by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long day's sun, became cool enough' to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep in. Here, in the lower wards, fish were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being roasted over street-corner fires and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sold by the skewerful, while circles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirsty ones squatted round the tubs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crude beer, which they were sucking through</seg><seg type="columnLine">straws to avoid the loose barley floating on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Longingly looked the seamen at the food</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drink, and exchanged appreciative</seg><seg type="columnLine">glances with the dark-eyed women who</seg><seg type="columnLine">mingled freely with the crowd. But not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of Ragnarr's crew lingered behind, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">they knew their captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here," said Kamas, stopping before a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large dwelling that seemed dark and empty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"is a guest-house where your men must</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain till morning, for at night no stran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers are permitted nearer the citadel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The place was a low, one-story stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">building, with a deeply recessed doorway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kamas took a torch from a niche in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">recess, lit it at the flare of the nearest door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, unlocked the wooden door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guest-house with a bronze key, and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered. Here was a single large room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a door in the rear leading to an ante-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IOO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kindling the torches stuck in brackets</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the walls, Kamas pointed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous stools and mats ranged about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor and then stepped to a sunken closet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wall. Holding his torch before it, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed fruit, bread, and wine-jars to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring sailors, then turned toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If it please you, my prince," he said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ragnarr, "it is time to wait on the king."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here Valgard interrupted:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have traveled far and wide, O Kamas,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said in angry tones, "but never yet have</seg><seg type="columnLine">I, the spokesman and kinsman of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">prince, been forbidden to go where he goes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor will I begin, at my age, to learn new</seg><seg type="columnLine">customs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Ragnarr interposed:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Strong men can break customs, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the weak break discipline. If you go</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me, who will keep these?" and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed at his men who were wrenching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plugs from the wine-jars, "from drowning</seg><seg type="columnLine">their sea-thirst with half the ale in Troy?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You speak wisdom where Kamas spake</seg><seg type="columnLine">folly," answered Valgard, turning on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take no notice of his bear's manners,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Ragnarr to the captain, as they left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house. "He growls at all times and is</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent only when he bites. He loves me</seg><seg type="columnLine">well and would keep by me at all times."</seg><seg type="columnLine">They continued their way in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction, following the street up a steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope, cut at intervals by broad concentric</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenues, dug out of the hill itself and faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">with polished stones. The spaces between</seg><seg type="columnLine">these avenues formed terraces covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings, the richer of stone, the poorer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun-baked brick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At every street corner the two encoun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the same dense crowd of people come</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to enjoy the cool night-air after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stifling day. All who met the pair stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">open-mouthed at Ragnarr's tall, barbaric</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All at once, as they were elbowing their</seg><seg type="columnLine">way through the thronged intersection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street with one of the avenues, an ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching voice cried out in a high-pitched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nasal chant. The crowds divided to right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left, squeezing as close as they could to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls of the buildings on either side, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all tongues were silent even in the midst of</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then was heard the sound of pattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and round the curve of the avenue</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">came two half-naked runners, carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">wands of office. They were followed by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">open litter, borne by four brawny blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad in leopard-skin kirtles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like sheaves bending in the wind, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, dense lines of the multitude sank to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their knees in one motion, the rustle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their garments drowning out the foot-beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the runners. Kamas knelt with the rest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Ragnarr, gazing at the litter in frank</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity, suddenly saw a vision that caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to stand as still as the heart in his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The light from the torch on the house-</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner behind him fell full on the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the occupant of the passing litter, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was outlined against the dark like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cameo. It was the face of a young girl, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">profile clear, well-shaped and of exquisite</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment Ragnarr stood immovable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes fastened on that face, till it grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim and faded out from the rays of light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he became aware that all the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">had risen, and Kamas was plucking him by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sleeve. He turned to follow, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped again and asked his guide:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who is she who passed but now, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty made all the people bow before her?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Is she a goddess?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kamas looked up at him curiously and</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered with a shade of amusement in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is Ilia, daughter of Dardanus our</seg><seg type="columnLine">king, and the people bowed before her</seg><seg type="columnLine">royalty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ragnarr moved slowly forward, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapt, his lips murmuring softly: "Ilia!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ilia!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ILIA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SOFT-FOOTED attendants bore away</seg><seg type="columnLine">the empty dishes, and, returning, filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slender cups with the amber wine of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sidon. Then the white-haired king, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrew'd old face alight with interest, turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the grave-featured youth at his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is indeed a wondrous tale, Prince</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ragnarr.

Let us</seg><seg type="columnLine">go, if you please, to my apartments."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At once he rose and all at the table stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, bowed their heads, and remained stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing till the king and the stranger he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">honored had passed from the columned</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall. At the door the two sentries drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside and raised their shields in salute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The king preceded Ragnarr down a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor to a curtained entrance, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they passed together. Ragnarr then</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself in a stately chamber, paneled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and roofed with cedar, the ceiling being</seg><seg type="columnLine">supported by graceful shafts of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood. Seating himself on a richly carved</seg><seg type="columnLine">armchair of Egyptian workmanship, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">king waved his guest to a divan opposite,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the light of a perfumed torch fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">full on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have dangerous neighbors," King</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dardanus began, picking his words slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Certain matters make it inadvisable for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to tell their names, but they have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">troublesome ever since it seemed good to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that our power should expand.

At last an articulate voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">rang out above the general tumult, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire multitude took up the cry in eager,</seg><seg type="columnLine">insistent unison:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rala!

Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wild, prolonged cheer went up, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lissom figure of a girl bounded to the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the platform and stood there, bow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and throwing kisses. She was small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost to tininess, and her supple, pliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">form was perfectly revealed by her pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessional costume--a narrow cloth about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loins and a tight cap enclosing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the tumult had died down an</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistant came out, carrying a long sword.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From his sleeve he drew a feather, tossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it into the air, and held the blade beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. The plume floated down across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge, and without a perceptible check con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued its fluttering course in two pieces.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he raised the sword, swung it round</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head twice and made a lightning-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroke at Rala. The crowd shuddered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Rala, poised on tiptoe, lightly turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">a complete back-somersault, landing up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right at the extreme back of the stage. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">sigh of relief escaped from the audience,</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed by a crash of applause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now a second man emerged from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent, his well-muscled body rippling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">every movement. He advanced to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front and stood still, feet together and arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">out horizontally from his sides. Rala,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a single bound, landed on his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders, stood there balancing a moment, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stooped till her hands rested in front of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. Then, slowly and carefully, her head</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting on his, she swung her feet backward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and upward till they pointed skyward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her arms moved down and out at her sides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralleling those of her partner; and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs bowed out from her jointed feet till</seg><seg type="columnLine">they formed an ellipse. Man and woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">together formed a complete and nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect crux ansata.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On her feet once more, Rala began an</seg><seg type="columnLine">intricate and dangerous sword-dance, tread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the measures with her hands, her body</seg><seg type="columnLine">poised in the air above the dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">blades. Suddenly there was a craning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">necks, cries of alarm were heard, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd began to melt. In a few minutes it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite dispersed, men, women and chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren fleeing in a dozen directions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her two assistants scrambled down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigate, then ran away swiftly, think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing only of themselves. Still Rala danced</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. Absorbed in the joy of the skilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">artist, she had not once looked at the au-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dience, had interpreted their cries of alarm</seg><seg type="columnLine">as expressions of fear for the dangers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her performance, and was quite unaware</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was alone. One, two more mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of the deft hands, and she hurled her</seg><seg type="columnLine">body over the blades, lighting squarely on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her feet in front of--emptiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There she stood, arms wide for her bow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and noticed for the first time that her au-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dience had disappeared. A cry of bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappointment burst from her; she stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking out over the desolate place with</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes in which tears of anger and mortifica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion burned. Then, and not till then, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears caught the sound of many feet and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough, threatening voices.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fear came into her eyes. She leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the street and fell, rose, staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fell again with a sob of agony, as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">intolerable pain shot through her ankle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vainly she strove to rise, the shouts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching mob ringing in her ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they burst upon her, a surging line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sheepskin-clad giants armed with long</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent - pins. The foremost lumberman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whooping with triumph, stooped, passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">an arm round her struggling body and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted her to his breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her lithe limbs writhed and the muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood out on her well-trained arms like</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashing cords. In vain. The mighty clasp</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the savage that held her did not weaken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In desperation she sank her teeth into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the Grip of the Minotaur</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">105</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bare neck. With a harsh oath he dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and clapped his hand to the wound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As she fell, another lunged at her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung her to him. She struck him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face with her clinched fists; then blackness</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed in upon her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RAGNARR stood in front of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">booth, the covering of which was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolf-painted sail of his galley. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">either hand, the wrappings of the now-</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened bales were stretched over oars to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make two more tents, in one of which his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men displayed pieces of red, white, or golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">amber, in the other, ingots of pure tin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Trojan officer of police beside him</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just said something highly amusing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at which the young Northman threw back</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head with a shout of laughter. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly he started and listened with straining</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears, his hand clutching the officer's arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is trouble of some sort," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There are many of them, by the voices.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You will need men at your back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The officer, whose city-bred ears were</seg><seg type="columnLine">less keen, stood listening for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then exclaimed--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are right! I go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And go he did, at a swift pace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of the tent came the grim figure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valgard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, master!" he exclaimed. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind brings the sound of battle, and where</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is fighting the wolves must follow."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Here come sheep," answered Ragnarr</seg><seg type="columnLine">contemptuously, as a knot of traders and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountebanks came rushing round the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, their faces sallow with fright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Run for your lives!" gasped a fat Tyrian</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he panted past. "Ten shipfuls of Euxine</seg><seg type="columnLine">pirates are harrying the fair!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hear no clatter of sword on shield,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Ragnarr calmly. "It is no battle, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fair-time brawl. Still, do you, Tyrleif,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep the men together and guard the booths</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Valgard and I go to look at these</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace-breakers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swiftly the two Northmen strode to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street-corner, round which poured an ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickening stream of fugitives who swerved</seg><seg type="columnLine">to right and left to let them pass. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the corner and saw dust rising and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tents going down some fifty paces up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main street before the onrush of a mob of</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin-clad men, waving long clubs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait, master," said Valgard. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">can not meet those lads unarmed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See what that tall fellow is carrying,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered Ragnarr. "Hasten!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up the street he dashed, and Valgard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">willy-nilly, after him. The advancing mob</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw two unarmed men speeding toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, hesitated and stopped in surprise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ragnarr strode straight to the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried Rala, seized him by the arm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly commanded him to put her down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lumberman stared at him stupidly for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment, then, realizing the import of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, cursed him violently and tried to pass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With one upward swing of his fist, Rag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">narr sent the giant spinning, and wrenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rala from his relaxing grasp. Swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to his shoulder, he started to give back;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but with shouts of rage the mob pressed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him, shouting: "Kill! Kill!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ragnarr had but one arm free to defend</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself and his burden, and it would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone hard with him but for Valgard. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">right and left shot the veteran's great knot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted fists, and two men fell as if poleaxed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seizing a stake from the hand of one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, Valgard placed himself beside his</seg><seg type="columnLine">master and struck out with fury. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific blows never missed, and those in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front began to give way. But the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northmen were outflanked, and a club</seg><seg type="columnLine">came down from the left, striking for Rag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">narr's head. He threw up his free hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ward off the blow, which fell on his heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiral armlet, shattering it to pieces. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had checked the force of the blow, or his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm had been broken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hitting his man under the chin with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strength of his arm, Ragnarr gave back</seg><seg type="columnLine">as fast as he could. He stumbled, turned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and felt his back fetch up against some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing solid. It was the scaffolding of Rala's</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform. Now he was safe on one side</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Valgard pressed close to him, striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly and coolly. Some one in the rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw a stake, which thudded against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood beside Ragnarr's head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They have us now," said Valgard</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his clinched teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above the tumult sang a strident sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half hum and half hiss, and one of the lum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bermen pitched forward, arms outstretched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an arrow between his shoulder-blades.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sound came again, more loudly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">three others fell. Then, with a shout, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">detachment of the soldiery who policed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair charged in with drawn swords. Cries</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pain mingled with yells of fury.</seg><seg type="columnLine">io6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mob made a short stand, then turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fled in panic, but many were overtaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mid-flight by the swift arrows. In five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes the place was clear, save for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead and dying who were picked up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried off by the soldiers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you unhurt, my lord?" asked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer--the same with whom Ragnarr had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been talking when he first heard the uproar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am well, but this maid seems some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what injured," answered Ragnarr, bending</seg><seg type="columnLine">solicitously over Rala.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is nothing but a contortionist," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the officer, "who makes sport for the rabble</seg><seg type="columnLine">on street-corners. It is not possible that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my lord risked his life for such as she?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sir," replied Ragnarr, his cheeks flushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with anger, "in my land a woman is a wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and men are willing to die for her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether she be a peasant's girl or a king's</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter.

The sun was not yet high</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to drive them to seek shelter from</seg><seg type="columnLine">its heat, and it was pleasant to look out</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the lovely valley and the low hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond to where the Straits broadened out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the blue .^gean.

She was thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stately Northman, whose stern, fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">young face had mingled itself with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">waking thoughts and thrust itself into her</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams from that first moment when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had pushed aside the curtains of her fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther's chamber and seen him standing be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Why did she think of him so much?

But that was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. When her waiting-maid told her of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wild street-fight in which Ragnarr had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in peril of Ms life, her heart had beat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">en tumultuously, as if something deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">within her had been intimately bound up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what was he to her? Why should</seg><seg type="columnLine">she care whether he lived or died? One</seg><seg type="columnLine">life more or less mattered little in the cruel</seg><seg type="columnLine">world in which she moved. In spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself, however, she had been deeply dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbed. And when she heard how Ragnarr</seg><seg type="columnLine">had carried that woman of the corner shows</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his arms, her head on his shoulder, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the Grip of the Minotaur</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">107</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">borne her to his own lodging, a sharp pang</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot through her, and the beautiful day lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of its brightness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was maddening merely to think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she, a princess of the blood of Teucer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">should resent a kindness shown by a wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering stranger to a wretched little acrobat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was she bewitched?

"If you love danger so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can make her your constant companion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">your bride. But this is the whole matter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you may take it or leave it. As you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, Troy depends for its very life on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade which is floated hither from all di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rections. From the northeast, timber is</seg><seg type="columnLine">rafted down from the Euxine; slaves are</seg><seg type="columnLine">borne to us from the south, amber from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">your own land, and tin from the Isle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mines in the northern seas, while copper</seg><seg type="columnLine">is carried--when it comes at all--from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island of Crete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now follow me closely.

I can not make</seg><seg type="columnLine">swords and spears without bronze; I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">not make bronze without copper and tin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minos, King of Crete, levies a crushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribute on me, and if I withhold it he keeps</seg><seg type="columnLine">copper from me and forbids the Myceneeans</seg><seg type="columnLine">to send me the tin which enters their waters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have no ships of my own, and Minos's</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless sails dot the wide waters of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mediterranean. If after a time I am still</seg><seg type="columnLine">defiant, he blockades my ports, and shuts</seg><seg type="columnLine">out all things which come by sea.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bravest heart can not fight an empty stom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ach. And as long as Minos held the sea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could wage only a defensive war, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gold would attract great hordes of mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cenaries from Egypt, Mycenas, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">East.

First you set</seg><seg type="columnLine">our craftsmen to work, till they have built</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small trading fleet. Then you bring in</seg><seg type="columnLine">many shiploads of arms from Egypt, till</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have enough. Then you shall go back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to your own people and induce them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">send great merchant-fleets, to cripple this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cretan devil's commerce. Then he will</seg><seg type="columnLine">swell with anger and think of war. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">by that time, what with the ships of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">people and those you shall teach us to build,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we shall have a fleet which can break his</seg><seg type="columnLine">navies and scatter his people to the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">winds!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dardanus rubbed his withered old hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chuckled in gleeful anticipation.

If</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sell you my sword, you must give me this."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Anything, noble Northman, anything,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saving only my crown itself," protested</seg><seg type="columnLine">the king, with an understanding gleam in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eye. "Ask and you shall receive."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then this shall be my reward, if I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">win it," said Ragnarr; "if I can not, I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask for nothing.

Having called</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to the rare beauty of the amber,</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding now a red piece, now a golden one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the light to catch the fading beams</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sun, he began to descant on t eir</seg><seg type="columnLine">virtues as amulets, swearing that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would keep off the fever, sunstroke, palsy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the falling sickness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One figure stood on the very edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaping crowd that packed the street out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the shallow front of the booth, a figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that never moved, but kept its eyes fixed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadowy interior of the tent. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman, her features wrapped in a volu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minous veil which swathed her to the knees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">effectively disguising face and figure. To</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her the gesticulating bard addressed him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in particular, declaring that the amber</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodule which he held in his hand was a sov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ereign remedy for jealousy and barrenness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly a shadow fell across the coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, and a hand struck the bit of amber</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his fingers. Immediately the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a rush for it, trampling and jostling</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other in their eagerness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Liar!" thundered Ragnarr at the trem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling Hjalti. "How often have I told you</seg><seg type="columnLine">that honest wares need no lying tales to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheapen them? Go to your tent, and bide</seg><seg type="columnLine">till I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A muffled cry rang out, and Ragnarr</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke off, looking up swiftly. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scramble for the amber, a tall Phoenician</seg><seg type="columnLine">had trodden heavily on the foot of the veiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady, who had fallen against the rude rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that protected the counter. The veil</seg><seg type="columnLine">half fell from her face, revealing the features</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Princess Ilia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ragnarr started violently. Then, as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">righted her veil, he sprang over the counter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drew her round the angle of the booth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in through the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you here, lady?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Follow me," she answered softly. "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no place to talk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Calling to Valgard to keep the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, he opened the door-flap again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they passed out swiftly. One or two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the more curious started to follow them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Valgard's shout brought a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sturdy Northmen who shoved these back</seg><seg type="columnLine">none too gently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swiftly Ilia led Ragnarr through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main thoroughfare and toward the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">grove on the bank of the Scamander.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There, close by the water and shaded by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clump of plane-trees, stood a stone bench</seg><seg type="columnLine">on which they seated themselves. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">westering sun dyed the river in crimson</seg><seg type="columnLine">stain, and the clouds were fringed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimson and opal. In the gathering dusk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slender figure crept up behind them un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They sat in silence for a while, then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke in slightly faltering tones:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My father has told me that you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to Egypt," she began. "I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of his purpose now, for he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">jubilant in his new hopes, and must un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bosom himself to one whom he trusts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alas, I feared he planned some dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">task for you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">112</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why did you fear it, lady?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsteadily. "Why should the peril of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger give you concern?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She hesitated, then spoke:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose, because you are unlike other</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. You seem above the evil and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intrigue in which we are forced to live, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">your heart is too clean and gallant for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">king to sacrifice to his bloody purposes."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She sighed very softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are they not necessary purposes?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They must be, or you would have naught</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do with them," she answered.

Why do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust me so?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because my heart tells me that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are good, better than our men are, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">truer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You do not come to dissuade me, then?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No. I come to bid you farewell, to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I could not say tomorrow, in the sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all men. I came to tell you that I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">never known so kind and brave a spirit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We may never see each other again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I may say freely that you have brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">new faith, new gladness, into a heart op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed with the sordid, petty ambitions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a selfish court. My spirit is the better</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you, Ragnarr."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could no longer restrain himself; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">love for her burst the bonds of control.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He rose to his feet before her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As you say," he began, "we may never</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet again. The sea is full of evil men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and evil forces, and it may be that I go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the land beyond this life. Or the gods</seg><seg type="columnLine">may perhaps be kind and bring me back</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. I, too, can say now what I dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">not say before: I love you, Ilia, love you</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all that is within me. If I return,</seg><seg type="columnLine">can you give your heart to me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She rose and put both hands on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is no concealment between you</seg><seg type="columnLine">and me," she answered. "I have loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">you these many days. I think I began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">love you when first I saw you. Do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember? You had just landed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kamas led you through our streets. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">litter was passing through the crowd; all</seg><seg type="columnLine">others fell to their knees, but you alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained standing. I saw you towering</seg><seg type="columnLine">above them, and your face was so good,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so free from the servile littleness of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, that I felt my heart warm to you even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">then. You saw me, too, and I knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were not unmoved."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gave a cry of joy and caught her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. They clung together, lip to lip and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart to heart, while the dark closed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them. And now the golden moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up and flooded the river with radiance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gently, Ilia drew his arms from around her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pointed to the sky pulsing with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty of the stars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must say farewell," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us go, my heart's beloved," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighed.

"What is that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was only the river plashing on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand," he answered, his arm stealing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">her waist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he was wrong. It was the sobbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THE MASTERS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TT WAS all-important for the success</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the old king's plans that Ragnarr</seg><seg type="columnLine">should not seem to be more than a wealthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">merchant. He had been graciously received</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the palace upon his arrival, but that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an honor accorded to all merchants of noble</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood. Now that he was about to depart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, any unwonted attention paid him</seg><seg type="columnLine">would attract the eyes of the multitude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">traders, foreign representatives, and spies</seg><seg type="columnLine">who crowded the fair, and perhaps start a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumor which Crete might seize upon. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">must go quietly, and from the fair-grounds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like any ordinary merchant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His men were to enter Troy by the South-</seg><seg type="columnLine">west Gate, collect their weapons from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Temple of the Mother and march out under</seg><seg type="columnLine">convoy to the street bordering the fair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grounds and thence west to the Scamander</seg><seg type="columnLine">where their boats would be waiting. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">conformity with this scheme, therefore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">King Dardanus had caused Ragnarr to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">summoned secretly to him that very night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only_a few hours after he had parted from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ilia. Ragnarr took advantage of this sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mons to take Rala to the palace with him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found occasion to see her safely into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ilia's hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the Grip of the Minotaur</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">113</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a tender farewell to Ilia, he sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presence of the king. Having received</seg><seg type="columnLine">the letters for the Pharaoh and a few final</seg><seg type="columnLine">instructions from Dardanus, Ragnarr took</seg><seg type="columnLine">his leave, reminding the king of his prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ise with his parting words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next morning he began his preparations</seg><seg type="columnLine">for departure. The sail-cloth covering was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripped from the booth and loaded into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger of the two boats. With Valgard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">six oarsmen he rowed down to the ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the sailors, as soon as the unloading</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been completed, had pulled up, stern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">foremost, on the sandy shore of the bay for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scraping and overhauling. Those left</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the ship, about fifty men, had camped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out on the beach and had been hospitably</seg><seg type="columnLine">cared for as guests of the coast-guard, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">special order of the king.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as they set eyes upon their</seg><seg type="columnLine">prince, the sailors raised a mighty shout of</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome, rushed to meet him, and crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">round to shake his hand with that free</seg><seg type="columnLine">good-fellowship that characterized the rela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the Northman to his lord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After greetings were said, Ragnarr and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his men launched the ship. They swarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">first round the bow, then the stern, took</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold, lifted mightily and thrust the wooden</seg><seg type="columnLine">rollers under. All gathered round the stern,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half on each side, their thick shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust against the planks, and shoved with</seg><seg type="columnLine">main force. The vessel heaved, settled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then rushed down into the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now some waded out, their hands on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">new-pitched sides, and held her; others</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed a chain from the shore and passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">along from man to man the sides of salt</seg><seg type="columnLine">meat, bags of grain, and crates of dried</seg><seg type="columnLine">fruit whch lay piled up on the beach, hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing been ferried down the river by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">king's orders, for their voyage. These were</seg><seg type="columnLine">stowed carefully in the shallow open hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">amidships, between the inboard ends of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowers' benches, and on them, cushioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and held in place with reed mats which pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected the provisions from rain and spray,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were placed the clay jars of water and wine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their mouths sealed with clay paste, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamped with the royal seal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, by Ragnarr's command, all but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valgard, himself, and the crew of their boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarmed over the galley's sides, half to</seg><seg type="columnLine">port and half to starboard, to maintain her</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance. The oars were brought out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust into the rowlocks, and the ship rowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to a safe depth and there anchored.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bidding the fifty bend on the sail and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main on board till he returned in mid-after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon, when he proposed to sail, Ragnarr</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the others re-embarked in their boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rowed back to the fair-ground, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended through the long, narrow plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">south of the city, westward to the Scaman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KING DARDANUS sat in a gild-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed chair on the northern wall of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">citadel, whence he could look out</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the plain of Troy and the rolling hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond, to the azure waters of the Helles-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pont. A gorgeously embroidered awning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarlet sheltered him from the almost verti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal rays of the noonday sun. Ilia sat beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, while behind stood Rala, fanning her</seg><seg type="columnLine">new mistress with a long-handled fan of</seg><seg type="columnLine">peacocks' feathers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old king basked happily in the warm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">soothing air. He was aglow with mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bodily comfort. The day was glorious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the view before his satisfied eyes was ra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diant with beauty. This was his city, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its gigantic walls, its temples and palaces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its bursting granaries, and coffers full to</seg><seg type="columnLine">overflowing. Its men were his, their hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick to seize sword or shield at his bid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ding. Best of all, he had found a mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend and ally in this valiant Northman</seg><seg type="columnLine">who would bring to him the trade of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">far-off land, reopen to him the commerce</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wide Mediterranean, and overwhelm</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cruel enemy and oppressor, Minos of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crete. His cup was full, and he felt a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of satisfaction in his fair daughter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose white arms bound this brave deliverer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him with the chains of love.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A white dot rose over the far edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hellespont. Dardanus chuckled softly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, seeing in the tiny, far-off sail a</seg><seg type="columnLine">symbol of the numberless fleets which</seg><seg type="columnLine">should come so soon to Troy, bearing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">riches of all the world. He watched it grow</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger and larger, till, as the ship that bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">it tacked, a puzzled frown began to drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smile from his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The one white spot had suddenly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come three! Rala, out of his sight behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chair, quietly laid down the fan, shield-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed her eyes with her hands, and watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">intently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Daughter," the king asked in a tone of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fretful bewilderment, "can you make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sails on yonder ship?

To</seg><seg type="columnLine">come now, when the prince's galley is still</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound in the port! Have they eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears in the very walls of my chamber, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn my purposes as they leave my lips?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He strode up and down, gnawing his fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers. Suddenly the light of resolution came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his eyes. He clapped his hands and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldier sprang round the corner of the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stood before him, raising his shielded</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go to Prince Ragnarr's tent!" cried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">king imperiously.

Every now and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one more forward than the rest would drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a bloody crown under the blow of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long tent-stake.

Narrow was her beam and</seg><seg type="columnLine">high her sides, even in the waist, from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lines of her hull soared upward to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forked stem - post and pennoned stern.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black was her paint from stern to shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the prow was a bright vermilion. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">many were the oars, and smooth their</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhythm, but the greatest marvel of all was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three tall masts--yes, three--that tow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered above her deck. Each was crossed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single yard, carrying what looked like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern topgallant-sail, for unlike the ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Northmen, this craft had her canvas</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoisted so high that a tall man could pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">under it with shouldered lance, even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stood on the raised fore-and-aft bridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Greatly did Ragnarr marvel to see men</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarm up the ladder-like shrouds of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing rigging, lay out on the yards, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly furl the three sails as the ship drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">nigh to the landing place. The oars gradu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally diminished their beat till the dripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the Grip of the Minotaur</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">blades were tossed and held, while the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad steering-oars guided her in to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing. By the dazzling glint of the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her gilded masts and carven, inlaid rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, she was clearly the galley of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealthy prince, some affluent sea-king of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the South.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ship was made fast to the stone rings</seg><seg type="columnLine">in two of the granite posts of the fair-grounds'</seg><seg type="columnLine">quay, a cleated gangway was lowered, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">two by two, some thirty marines disem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barked at the double and drew up on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank. They were men of uncommonly</seg><seg type="columnLine">short stature, broad - shouldered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarthy, almost copper-colored, with pinch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed-in waists confined in broad leathern belts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From these hung short broadswords in em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bossed scabbards. The hilts were of ivory</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the pommels of silver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each man wore a conical helmet of pol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished bronze, a gorgeously embroidered</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist-cloth above which shone the naked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coppery breast, and leathern boots reach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing half-way up the leg. Some carried un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent bows in their hands and full quivers</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspended over their shoulders; the rest bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">long spears with leaf-shaped heads of bronze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down the gangway now strode two im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressive figures, a young man and an old.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The youth wore about his shoulders a rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">mantle of scarlet caught up with a golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">clasp; the hilt of his short sword was of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pure gold, with a gleaming jewel set in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pommel. His shapely head was uncovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his jet-black hair dangled about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks in three long curls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His face was handsome and his eyes in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solent; a thin nose and two daintily curved</seg><seg type="columnLine">red lips proclaimed the aristocrat. His com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion, gray-haired and lantern-jawed, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently a naval officer of high rank. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet bore three red plumes, and an onyx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hilted dagger was fixed diagonally across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front of his girdle. At a curt command</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him, the marines wheeled and marched</seg><seg type="columnLine">up into the fair-ground, the two officers at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up the street swung the warlike band,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder to shoulder, chests thrust out, left</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms swinging slightly as the booted feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">came down in the crisp cadence of perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">drill. Neither to right nor left they looked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but straight ahead, with the eyes of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who know themselves for masters, in what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever company. The crowd made way for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as they came, giving the Cretans the</seg><seg type="columnLine">full width of the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ragnarr seethed with indignation.

An officer ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward and rudely tried to thrust the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northman out of the way. Valgard's great</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist lashed out like the hoof of an angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">stallion, and the Cretan dropped, stunned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bleeding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young commander gave a sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">order in his native tongue. The column</seg><seg type="columnLine">jarred to a halt, except for the first four</seg><seg type="columnLine">marines who sprang round their two leaders</seg><seg type="columnLine">and closed in on Valgard with lowered pikes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With one bound, Ragnarr confronted them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spreading his arms between them and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glaring old warrior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the hand of Tyr!" he thundered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We are few and unarmed, and ye be many</seg><seg type="columnLine">and well able to slay us with those weapons</seg><seg type="columnLine">which ye bear here unlawfully.

Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the half-company of Trojan archers that</seg><seg type="columnLine">policed the fair and now stood close behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Northmen, hesitated to defend the sanc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tity of the place and the sovereign rights of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Troy against the insolence of the masters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Remove those fellows!" cried the Cretan</seg><seg type="columnLine">commander, and the four marines, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated at the intrusion of the blue-eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant, again rushed at Valgard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Ragnarr seized the foremost by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat, swung him off his feet, and snatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the short sword from the Cretan's scabbard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swinging the broad blade between Valgard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his foes, the prince kept the three at</seg><seg type="columnLine">bay, while his voice rang in the ears of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitude like a trumpet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fellow-merchants!" he cried.

But before he could utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words, his lantern-jawed companion laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bony hand on the youth's smooth shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der and whispered in the Cretan tongue:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My lord, these must be the men whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">we seek.

The rest closed up, the old admiral</seg><seg type="columnLine">barked out a sharp word of command, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marines swung smartly to the left, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took up their march toward the Sczean Gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mongrel crowd burst into hoots and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jeers, with derisive signs and obscene ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures of defiance.

But the size of the bullet will cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">her arrest--that and the fact that she hated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe so much; and when her trial comes off</seg><seg type="columnLine">she won't stand for the grilling of the pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ecuting attorney, and her very nerve will</seg><seg type="columnLine">give her away!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through Harman's brain there flashed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">something Bess had said to him less than an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour before: "I'm keepin' a secret now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's a big secret, too." So the killing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who she believed had killed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother she had loved more than life, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was her big secret! That poor little hot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed, fiery-souled child! He regretted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had given her the rifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blair continued in tones that were low</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tense:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even if the Larrimores prove that Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falls killed the son of Old Henry, it won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear the girl. And it's up to you and me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save her, Tpm, my friend. One of us must</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a sacrifice for this girl we both love.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Either of us is big enough to do it. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have a chance of escape, but Bess</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't. Don't you see, Tom? Well, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you game?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Am I game!" muttered the mountaineer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclined toward feeling insulted at being</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. "Marvin, my middle name is game.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How'll we decide which one of us is to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sacrifice?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blair took a coin from his pocket. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a copper cent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tails it's you," he whispered, "and heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's me. Is that all right?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pitch it!" said Tom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blair flipped the coin to the rafters; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">spun in the air, over and over, and fell with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slight tinkle. The two men bent forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's up to me," said Harman, straighten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; and he said it without regret, like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They shook hands silently, and then they</seg><seg type="columnLine">went downstairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIFTEEN minutes later Harman</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked into the room where all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was left of Joe Falls lay under an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old quilted coverlet.

The lean, bearded man was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deputy sheriff, and he had only that minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Does anybody here know who killed this</seg><seg type="columnLine">man?" he asked quietly, his shaggy brows</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn above his alert gray eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I done it," said Tom Harman, putting</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his wrists for the irons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now Bill Hines knew Harman, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Woman Keeps a Secret</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">129</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that Harman had a reputation as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good, fair fighter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It seems to me you was hasty, Tom,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. "You could ha' broke Joe Falls</seg><seg type="columnLine">over your knee and saved gunpowder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What made you do it, Tom?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I reckon I'll carry my little bit o' talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the trile jedge, Bill," drawled Harman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ef you're ready to go, I am."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The deputy ironed the mountaineer, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew his revolver, not that he thought he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might need it for Harman, but because there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was danger of the dead man's relatives</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a violent demonstration. Hines took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prisoner out to where his horse stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitched to a little cedar, and mounted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, with Harman walking briskly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road ahead of him he started for a town in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lowlands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not for one second had the mountaineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant to face a trial in the courthouse at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnsboro; nor did he mean to allow himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be even locked up in the Johnsboro jail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was fully determined that he would es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape from Hines before they reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowlands. But he had a little talking to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he made his escape, and he proceed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bill," he said over his shoulder, "ef</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've threatened to kill me on sight, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot you down the fust time we meet, can</seg><seg type="columnLine">I be sent up for that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hines answered--"Not if you can prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I threatened to kill you on sight."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harman stopped as suddenly as if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been struck. He acted well, indeed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The devil!" he cried as if greatly cha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grined. "Bill Hines, I hain't got no wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesses to prove it by!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looks bad. Let's go on, Tom," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seemed more watchful than before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He kept his hand close to the butt of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver now. Bill Hines had an oath to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep, and he meant to keep it. Had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner been his own mother's son it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made no difference.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Harman had to escape. He was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rabbit that climbed a tree. Over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over in his mind he turned this plan and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. He thought of leaping from a cliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road ran on and hiding himself, all but</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nose, in a pool of the creek below; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of frightening Hines's horse and</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a quick dive into the thick laurels--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and half a dozen other things--but none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these methods promised enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hines was accustomed to tricks. Hines</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself was a fox. Harman did not fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon an idea that thoroughly pleased him</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they had covered several miles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How small the things that sometimes de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cide human destinies! Twice that day al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready the tide of Tom Harman's life had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been turned by the mere tossing of a coin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And still another turn was at hand. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">time it was so little a thing as the sight of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray squirrel that ran along on the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisking its bushy tail and making a noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">something like the quacking of a young</seg><seg type="columnLine">duck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was in the squirrel-shooting season.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had it not been the Seventh Day, the woods</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have rung with the echoes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunter's rifle. As it was, Harman had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard only one shot; generally speaking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hillfolk remember the Sabbath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Harman stopped and faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A word with ye, Bill," he said, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed badly frightened. "Them Fallses</seg><seg type="columnLine">will take a shot at me as shore as the devil's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad as soon as we git in them thick hick'ry</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods ahead thar. I want to ax ye, Bill, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep both o' yore eyes wide open for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falls with a rifle. I hain't in a fix to defend</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hines seemed impressed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've been thinking of that," he growled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another mile they made. They had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most passed through a long stretch of gold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">en-yellow hickories when from the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainside above and to the right there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the keen thunder of a rifle, and Tom Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man wheeled and crumpled and fell on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face in the dust of the road. He moaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned on his back, and Bill Hines saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a red splotch on his blue chambray shirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">squarely over his heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told you--to watch for a Falls--you</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin-can officer," he muttered disconnectedly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasping, writhing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When a man is shot straight through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart there is no chance for him to live.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill Hines swore a loud oath, spurred his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse and rode, his revolver ready in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, into the hickories. A moment later</seg><seg type="columnLine">he surprised a bare-headed and freckled</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth in the act of ramming a round bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the barrel of an old muzzle-loader.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll shoot a man I've got arrested,</seg><seg type="columnLine">will you!" cried Hines. "Hands up, you--</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy smiled good-naturedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">130</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've treed the wrong 'coon, mister,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he drawled.

Light broke to Bill Hines, the fox.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He rode at a breakneck pace back to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had left Tom Harman for dead. Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knowed," said Harman to the friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">who, with a hammer and an ax, broke the</seg><seg type="columnLine">irons from his wrists late that night, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the'd shorely be a hunter in them hick'ries,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sunday or no Sunday. So I gethered me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">handful o' pokeberries from the side o' the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road to make blood, and took the resk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And so now it's me for Kaintucky. So long.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Much obliged, and good luck!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night and the laurels swallowed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE were no logging-camps in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that section of the Blue Grass State</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which Tom Harman went. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der a high-sounding name he hired himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a wealthy horse-breeder; and the horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeder liked him, paid him good money for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his work and asked no questions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For nearly three years he tried to be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tented with the idea that he had sacrificed</seg><seg type="columnLine">home and friends and his heart's desire in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthy cause. Then he began to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward frequently, of Bess and his moth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er, and the blooming laurels on Black Pine</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mountain, and the call came; the longing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too great to be thrown down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wore a nicely pointed young black</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard now, and he was of the opinion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">even his own brother would have difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">in recognizing him. So he decided that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would just slip back home and see Bess again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his people, and his good friend, Marvin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blair, then slip back to . Kentucky without</seg><seg type="columnLine">the law's being any the wiser. And perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">--perhaps he would bring Bess back with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as his wife. He believed she loved him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And if she did love him, could she refuse to</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry him after what he had done for her?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back to Tennessee's dim blue hills went</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom Harman, and he walked the last hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred miles of the journey because he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to run the risk of meeting the fox, Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At noon of a day toward the last of July</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reached the crest of long, low Black Pine</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mountain and sat himself down on a stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rest. Spread out before him, beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the waxen white of the laurel bloom, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">his beloved home country. The old logging-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">camp was still there, but a great deal of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">timber, of course, was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From where he sat he could see neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">his father's nor old Henry Larrimore's cab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in; so he gave his attention wholly to his old</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends, the sputtering locomotive, the thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering skidders, and the long-armed log-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loader.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For half an hour he sat there and watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">it; then he rose and went rapidly down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountainside to shake the right hand of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marvin Blair, if he was still there; and Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man hoped he was. Blair, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't tell; and when he had seen his old</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend he would go over to see Bess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found Blair easily. Blair was giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders to a pair of cutters--he now held a</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreman's place--and that was good. Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was very glad of that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harman stepped out of the blooming</seg><seg type="columnLine">laurels and confronted his old partner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Marvin, do you know me?" he cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">happily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not from a side of sole-leather," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blair, halting abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tom!" smiled the mountaineer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Harman!" exclaimed Blair. "How're</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Tom?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keen as a mink!" They shook hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How's Bess Larrimore, Marvin?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," said Blair. He went on nerv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously: "Say, Bill Hines has haunted this</seg><seg type="columnLine">place almost daily since you got away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He feels that his honor will never be</seg><seg type="columnLine">made whole until he gets you--you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how he is, Tom. And he'd know you</seg><seg type="columnLine">through your beard. He'd know you if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you had a bear's face on you! Better sneak</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to your father's and hide there, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it quick. I'll be over tonight to see you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'll tell Bess you're here. Be careful!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hines holds out that you will be caught if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes the rest of his life."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," said Harman, and he dove</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the thick laurels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost on a line between him and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">father's cabin was the cabin of old Henry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larrimore, and the temptation to stop and</seg><seg type="columnLine">see Bess for one little minute became strong.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He yielded to it and went creeping up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring under the giant hemlock. Bess was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nowhere in sight, and he went on to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. A gray-nosed old hound came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather-beaten gate to meet him, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave it a friendly pat on the head. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hallooed softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bess came to the door. He saw that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Woman Keeps a Secret	131</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was a full-grown woman now, mature and</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundish. She wore her hair up, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore shoes and stockings, and skirts of blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">percale reached to her ankles. It was evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent that she did not know him. Forgetting</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about Bill Hines, he acted upon a mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chievous impulse and said to her:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm a travelin' fortune-teller, kind lady,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all I charge for a full life readin' is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitiful sum of ten cents. Your money back</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you're not satisfied."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came smoothly enough. Nearly three</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of association with Kentucky horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had taken away much of his native</seg><seg type="columnLine">dialect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come in and have a chair on the porch,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Bess with a vague unhappiness in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. "I'll bring out the money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harman went to the porch and sat down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He drew the rim of his broad black hat low</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his eyes to prevent her from recogniz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him. She came out, gave him a nickel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and five pennies and sat down in a chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing him. He put the money into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket and reached for her hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A man who loves you is not far away,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he began in a monotone, staring intently at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her palm. "He has come back here to ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to marry him. He couldn't think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything but you in the daytime, nor dream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of anything but you at night, up in Ken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tucky. He loves you more than life; and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you love him the devil hisself cain't keep</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you two apart. If you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young woman tore her hand from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went to her feet. She knew him now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even through his beard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tom!" she cried broken-heartedly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was all the grim tragedy and suffering</seg><seg type="columnLine">of death in her brown eyes. "Tom! You've</seg><seg type="columnLine">come back for me, and I--I've done went</seg><seg type="columnLine">and married myself to a man I hate!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Married!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harman, too, went to his feet. His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was chalky white, and he looked at her with</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern and bitter reproach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two months ago," she said.

Still-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"What made you marry him?" he asked,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and his voice was pinched down so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the woman thought he was speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't think I'd ever see you any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more," she answered weakly and hopelessly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My father and mother died after you left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wanted a home of my own.

"How come it that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you run away to save me? Are you crazy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom, or am I? I don't know what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean, Tom! Oh, I wisht you hadn't ha'</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed Joe Falls.

"Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you--you was the one that killed Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falls. You done it with the little rifle I</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought for you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Tom," almost hysterically, "you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know I couldn't kill a man, don't you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Light broke to Harman. Suddenly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood: Marvin Blair himself had</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed Joe Falls, in a card game, of course;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and afterward Blair had cleverly covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his crime and cleared the way to the pretti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est girl in the Black Pine section at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">cunning stroke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It threw Harman into a boiling rage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he was disappointed, too. Truly, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">real friends of a man's lifetime may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">counted on one's fingers, for friendship is</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarce, and finer, less selfish than any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of love. But, after all, Blair had wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingly taken his chance on the tossing of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coin. There Tom Harman found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a dilemma.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He told Bess all about it. Bess went</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the cabin and returned a moment later</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a fully loaded automatic pistol of</seg><seg type="columnLine">132</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">small caliber, which explained much to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harman. That pistol had been used in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">killing of Joe Falls, he was sure. He un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaded it and gave it back to Bess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put it where you found it," he said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. "I'll be back tonight to have a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk with Marvin," he went on, turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the gate, "and you'd better not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You ain't a-goin' to kill him, Tom!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I guess not.

She blushed hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pily-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom's people told him they had not seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill Hines for months.

Then Tom and his father laid a plan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mark Harman took his long rifle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to see that Blair did not try to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">an escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT SUNDOWN, while Tom sat at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the supper-table, Bill Hines walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in with a revolver in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got you, Tom," he said quietly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, I guess you have, Bill," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom; and he ate on as if it were a very com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monplace thing to be arrested on a charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder. "Have some supper, old hoss?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thanks, not if I know it," Hines winked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'll play no more tricks on me, Tom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You won't get away this time!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I won't?" laughed Harman, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad wedge of huckleberry pie in hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How do you know I won't?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait and see if you do," smilingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When you got away from me three years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago you done something to brag about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know it. Marvin Blair sent for you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't he?

When Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hines had taken his prisoner toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnsboro jail, Marvin Blair drew a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath of relief and started rapidly home-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. And behind him, stalking him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently as ever he had stalked a bear or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deer, went old Mark Harman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was pitchy dark when Blair reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin that he called home. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">light in the log-house, at which he wondered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He entered, lighted a lamp that was on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small home-made table and called for Bess;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no answer. Frowning, he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the automatic pistol from its place on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high smoked mantel and dropped it into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket; and then he sat down at the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">table and began to turn certain matters over</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the front door opened suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in stepped Tom Harman, and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no officer with him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hi, Marvin," said Harman with a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">good imitation of the camaraderie of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old days, as he dropped into a chair across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table from Bess's husband.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello," muttered Blair worriedly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right hand went to the butt of the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue pistol in his coat-pocket. "Seen Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hines?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes.

Just above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the table he thrust the round nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a big revolver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm actin' deputy-sheriff now," he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, his voice growing harder, "and I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to arrest you for killin' Joe Falls in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">card game!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All in the space of a second Marvin Blair</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted downward, aimed the little blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol and pulled the trigger.

He picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the penny and tossed it. It fell tails up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three more times in succession it fell tails</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. It was like a coin enchanted. Blair</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined it closely in the yellow light of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oil lamp; then he swore bitterly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw it disgustedly to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What's the matter?" asked Harman</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly. "Is anything wrong with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">penny, Marvin? Why, man, it's the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">same penny we pitched nearly three years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago to see which one of us went up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place o' the girl we both loved!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went on, in another tone:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You scoundrel, you cheat, you low-down</seg><seg type="columnLine">piker! That penny was made out o' two</seg><seg type="columnLine">pennies--it's got tails on both sides! No</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder you was willin' to take your chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">on tails! How did I come by it?

When Blair had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been ironed the young mountaineer gave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty revolver and the badge back to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">owner. Hines, a little distrustful, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept Tom covered while he was working out</seg><seg type="columnLine">his part of that which had just taken place</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Bess had her separation, Harman</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to see her.

Doc Saunders</seg><seg type="columnLine">had barred the door to the curious, and only</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and Denny and the rubbers remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Gene Williamson, the challenger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The latter lay naked on a sheet-covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">board, a herculean man, as tall and thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rugged as an oak. His body was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely white. In the dim light it glowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpse-like. The rubbers hunched over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, their hands making soft, patting</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denny did not look at Gene, but at Saun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders, who faced the window and the light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which fell upon his face and revealed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruel distinctness the ravages of a dread</seg><seg type="columnLine">disease. His eyes were very bright, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with a strange glassy film. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were blue eyes, so dark a blue they often</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed black, and their gaze was discon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certingly level.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one endured that gaze for very long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps for fear of revealing to him their</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding and their pity. One felt in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctively that his was too proud a spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bear pity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Where he had come from no one knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no one cared to ask, least of all Denny</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boone, for all that Saunders was so kind to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He had drifted into the training camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">one day and become a fixture, quite natur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, without meeting with protest or offer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing explanation. It had come out somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">or other that he was a doctor who had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his practise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Skipper Burns welcomed his medical</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge and his worldly knowledge as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well. He seemed to have as extensive an</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquaintance with ring history as did Skip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per, and his ideas on diet and training were</seg><seg type="columnLine">authoritative.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He it had been who advised retaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denny Boone as a sparring partner for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">challenger. The boy had ridden in from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mines back in the mountains and tim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly offered his services. Skipper Burns</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">told him kindly but firmly to go to -.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Burns was a kiridly man, but he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">pestered almost out of his existence by as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piring amateurs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the doctor had taken the boy by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm, and, staring all the while into his eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had run his fingers up and down the other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeve from the wrist to the shoulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denny had stiffened under his touch. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something potentially galvanic in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin fingers. And he had met the doctor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutiny without winking. His conscience</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like his blue eyes, unclouded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Strip!" Saunders had commanded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thin, husky voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burns raised impatient yet respectful</seg><seg type="columnLine">protest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aw, Doc, whatta you ringin' in a kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that for at this stage of the game?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Besides he ain't more than a middle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again those fingers swept up and down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy's arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A shade under two hundred, Skipper."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they stripped Denny and put him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the scales the beam balanced at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and ninety-eight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had only been in the ring with Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liamson the fraction of a moment when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burns dashed in between them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The White Hope's Understudy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">139</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say!" he accused Denny. "I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">you said you hadn't fought before?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've not really fought, sir," blushed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy; "just with the men around the mine."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"G'wan! What do you take me for?</seg><seg type="columnLine">You never learned no guard like that around</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mine. Who's been teachin' you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jeff Moloney, sir. He's foreman of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">shift."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Moloney? Old Jeff Moloney, the wel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter? Why in the blue-blazes didn't you say</seg><seg type="columnLine">so?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burns turned to the doctor in great ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Didja see how he covers up and fights</seg><seg type="columnLine">from under, Doc? It's the nigger's style</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the ground. He's just what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to practise this wild-hittin' Irishman</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mine on. Go in, boy, and let him try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hit you. Take it easy. Under, Gene,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under, I tell you! Cut out that swingin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a gate and come from under. You can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt the top of his head. Under!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pudgy manager was all perspiration</seg><seg type="columnLine">and delight when he sent the men to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">showers. His charge was encountering just</seg><seg type="columnLine">that defense he would meet with in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great battle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The kid's a jewel," he crowed. "Didja</seg><seg type="columnLine">see him, Doc? He covers up like an angel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he's got a kick in each paw."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He has more than that, Skipper," smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saunders enigmatically. "He has the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest asset of all--a clean heart!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burns looked depressed. The Doc was</seg><seg type="columnLine">always shooting something over that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't wise to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As far as Denny was concerned Saunders</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all enigma. He felt drawn to him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet repelled. He respected him and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared him, frail and wasted as he was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was something uncanny in that frail</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, teetering on the grave's edge, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing awe-inspiring in those too bright eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seemed to pierce through the mortal</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtains to the Great Hinterland. And yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">his presence was a tonic to the boy; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch, somehow, made him feel strong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The importance of conditioning William-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son had dwarfed all other considerations in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the camp, and Denny's needs, scant as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, would have been neglected had it not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been for Saunders. He rubbed the boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">down with his own hands after the sparring</seg><seg type="columnLine">matches. He seemed to experience a holy</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy in handling that splendid young body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a bitterness showed through the joy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which made Denny very uncomfortable. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was impossible to pity him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was deserving of pity, the boy de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided, as he watched him now. His skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">was waxy-pale, and his scanty sorrel beard</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not hide the blue hollows in his cheeks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One did not have to hear the hacking cough</seg><seg type="columnLine">issue from his flat chest to know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he turned his head and met the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy's eyes. Denny looked down quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not quickly enough, he feared, to pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent the other reading his thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Denny," came from Saunders as sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly as that glance had come, "do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember your mother?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denny looked up, wide-eyed and startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by this question, so irrelevant to the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir," he managed to say. "She died</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I was a baby."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She was a Norwegian," the man went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, his eyes strangely dreamy; "a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendid figure of a woman, true daughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the North and the Vikings. Your father</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Scotch-Irish. You see I have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking you up! He stood six feet two in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stocking feet. Ah, Denny, Denny, lad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what a wonderful heritage!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My father and mother were cousins,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went on after a pause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy stirred uncomfortably. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saunders had looked at him his excitement</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been wiped out as completely as a wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponge wipes out the figures on a slate; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rather preferred that excitement, pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful as it had been, to this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're twenty years old," the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">mused aloud. "You've never smoked?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never touched liquor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never--but I can see that. Ah, Denny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lad!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The silence that ensued was really de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressing. Denny stared out at his moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains, and wished fervently that he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them, wished that he were anywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">but here, wrapped about by the embarrass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND then that silence was snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a thin cord is.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doc!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Williamson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doc!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no mistaking significance in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that throaty cry. Saunders glided over like</seg><seg type="columnLine">140</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a cat and brushed the rubbers aside and</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. The order came casually enough, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a crisp undertone that had a disturb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly electric quality:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bring me the ice-bucket, Denny."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy obeyed, and the little action left</seg><seg type="columnLine">him breathless. He was vaguely aware that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rubbers stood beside him, tense as</seg><seg type="columnLine">statues. He was tense himself, with horror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In spite of the dim light he saw that Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liamson's lips were blue and the rest of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face dead-white, like the belly of a fish.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes were rolled far back, so that only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small arc of the iris showed beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper lids. Even as the boy looked, a gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">froth bubbled from one corner of the challen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger's mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With movements surprisingly deliberate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saunders lifted -the bucket with its tinkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">contents and dashed a portion over Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liamson's face, then his hairy chest, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stomach. The outer wall of the latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">winced inward from the icy contact, his dia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phragm jerked up into his chest, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew in a long, sibilant breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doc!" he moaned, exhaling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denny's tenseness melted. Every muscle</seg><seg type="columnLine">collapsed into fiaccidity, every nerve began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tingle until he was shivering wretchedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">from head to foot. He was stark afraid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A towel!" commanded Saunders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither Denny nor the rubbers stirred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were not able. Saunders whirled im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patiently, flashed a look at the boy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled. Under the lash of that look Denny</seg><seg type="columnLine">had hurried for the towel. The doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">dipped it in what was left of the ice-water</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bound it about Williamson's head, cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had not heard the door open, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cry, shrill with premonition, made them</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn. There stood Burns, his face blotchy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his paunch quivering, his big studs winking</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blinking malevolently in the light from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little window. Behind him stood other</seg><seg type="columnLine">men: the governor of a neighboring state,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was to make the presentation speeches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the promoter of the fight, pink and perspir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, Ike Richards, manager for Jake Jen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kins, the negro champion. The door was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with curious faces, all strained with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same unreasoning dismay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His heart," explained Saunders briefly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I was afraid of it. Overstrain. He can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "O Gawd!" moaned Burns and went limp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made no move toward Williamson. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was curious that neither he nor any of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him thought to question Saunders's</seg><seg type="columnLine">decision. For a moment there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunned silence and then, like a far-off wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever growing nearer, a whisper spread and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew. It was stilled abruptly by a rasping</seg><seg type="columnLine">command from the doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't let any one get upstairs with this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We mustn't let them know--yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What can be done? What can be done?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">palpitated the governor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "O Gawd!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There must be a fight!" This from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">promoter, with tears in his eyes. "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are fifteen thousand out there. And all</seg><seg type="columnLine">those Mex soldiers. There'll be a riot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"-!" cut in Richards roughly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"There'll be war."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Find a substitute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They all looked at Saunders with quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cal Motter is out there-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And Dreadnought Green!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hog-fat the both of them," groaned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">promoter. "It would be a joke."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a bum joke, any way you look at it,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Richards. "Who is around that is in</seg><seg type="columnLine">training?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following the question they were silent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring at Saunders. Without effort on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">part he had taken command. All instinc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively looked to him for the answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a little ghost of a smile on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips that was reassuring. Slowly he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked at Denny Boone; and all eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed his. Then he looked back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's go outside, gentlemen, and talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">this over," he said quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They filed slowly out with little curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">glances over their shoulders. The rubbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">went with them. They seemed eager to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from that white, hoarsely breathing</seg><seg type="columnLine">man on the sheet-covered board. The doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor went last of all, closing the door behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Denny was left alone with the broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">challenger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His first act was to move over into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">far corner from Gene Williamson, and slump</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakly on a bench. Reason told him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter could be in no danger. The doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not have left him'so callously, had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">been. Nevertheless, Denny could not con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quer an inward shrinking. The whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">ironic situation was too truly horrible. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could scarce believe Fate able to play such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a prank upon that huge, massive frame</seg><seg type="columnLine">The White Hope's Understudy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">141</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">glooming almost ghastly in the half-light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It looked too competent, too self-sufficient,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too perfect a creation of flesh to harbor a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaw. The thing was incredible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was glad when two Red Cross assist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants came in and bore Williamson away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He hoped the big fellow was unconscious.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was such a wholesome, good-natured</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow, and he had worked so hard and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopefully, for this!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denny sucked in his breath sharply and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried to the window where he could look</seg><seg type="columnLine">out at the mountains, his mountains. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he ever left them? He did not like this</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruel game. He had only come because</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moloney had insisted. There was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing he could teach the challenger, the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">welter had said. But of what avail was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">teaching now? Williamson was out of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somebody had to take his place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shivered. He remembered how Saun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders had turned and looked at him--how</seg><seg type="columnLine">they all had looked at him. He remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered those curious backward glances.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had looked first at him and then at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gene Williamson. There was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">movingly significant in their fastening upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the priority of interest. Of a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">the feet and the warring voices overhead</seg><seg type="columnLine">took on a new sound, one that concerned</seg><seg type="columnLine">him intimately. His eyes clung to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains in a desperate effort to absorb</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them a portion of their serenity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hand fell upon his shoulder. He stiffen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, as he always did when Saunders touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Slowly he turned and met those</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue eyes, a blue so deep it was almost black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Saunders was smiling faintly. Both the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile and his eyes conveyed a meaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denny strove desperately to avoid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How--how is Gene?" he faltered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Gene? He'll be all right with a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest. But the fight must come off, Denny.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We've found a substitute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who?" The boy's lips hardly formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Saunders's answer was even more inaudi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble. It was not even spoken. His fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightened on Denny's shoulder; and Denny</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a comforting touch, that Denny's</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts, emotions, even muscles, which a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment before had been asserting them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves independently, suddenly became cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tralized and obedient to his will. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of but one objection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But Gene's trunks won't fit me, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Saunders's face became radiant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew it! Not a blemish!

The gallery cheered</seg><seg type="columnLine">blithely, ignorant for the most part that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not the advertised challenger. A group</seg><seg type="columnLine">of native soldiery on one of the topmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows, overcome by enthusiasm, or perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">mescal, capped the climax with a fusillade of</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver shots directed skyward. Feminine</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieks were drowned in a wave of mascu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line laughter. Handkerchiefs and broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brimmed sombreros were flaunted; good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">humor reigned again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Little Doc Saunders, in his seat in Den-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ny's corner, smiled and rubbed his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The demonstration had scarcely begun to</seg><seg type="columnLine">abate when it spurted into new and greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">activity.

The management, with much wisdom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had decided to dispense with the usual ora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory and introductions, and to stage the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight before any malcontents could incite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbance. So long as they could feast on</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle the crowd would be content. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">furrowed deep valleys in the promoter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pink brow was: Would that feast continue</seg><seg type="columnLine">long enough to whet the appetite of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood-lustful?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long do you think the kid will</seg><seg type="columnLine">last?" he screeched to be heard above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">uproar; but he only got a mournful shake of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head from Burns, and from Saunders an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enigmatic smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jenkins had ceased bowing, although the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm of sound was scarcely diminished. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung aside his dressing-gown and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Umber up his muscles, stretching, dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">daintily on his toes, shadow-boxing, all with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the same pleased self-consciousness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">animates the strutting peacock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denny, from his corner where the seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">were kneading his limbs and binding his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands with tape, watched the big black.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not look at the tremendous body or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knotted muscles flowing up and down</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the coppery skin; he looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jenkins's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The negro was all smiles, good-nature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but behind the smile the boy sensed some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that roused a slowly mounting ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosity. It was not anger, rather a cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorn. In Jenkins's thick lips, in his low</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead, the slanting skull, the wide, brutal</seg><seg type="columnLine">nostrils, was revealed a capacity for evil,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more, a familiarity with evil, and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet, a compliance toward evil that jarred</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the virgin instincts of Denny Boone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The very sight of Jenkins made him bristle</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a dog will bristle when it comes upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brute scent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's hollow--hollow!" ran his thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly, joyfully.

From the seats nearest, es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecially from the newspaper section, he met</seg><seg type="columnLine">many glances, some of interest, and some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusement, but the far greater number of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pity-.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His lips just moved in a smile.

The latter answered never a word.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He rocked in, pressed his chin against that</seg><seg type="columnLine">black shoulder, drove his fists into that</seg><seg type="columnLine">black body, always just below the arch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the breastbone!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jes' look at li'l massa hittin' ol' Jake!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why, son, you ought-a be arrested for pickin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">on er ol' man lak Jake.

He wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware that Jenkins had been driving at it</seg><seg type="columnLine">continually.

All his defense</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been subconscious, without effort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">will on his part, the result, probably, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some supersensitive instinct. All his will</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his brain were focused upon one pur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">10</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pose--to reach Jenkins's hollow body and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave it in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was as little aware of the real animus</seg><seg type="columnLine">directing this purpose as he was with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">details of his defense. He knew he hated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jenkins with a cold, consuming hatred, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hardly knew why, unless it was because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seen hatred of the black in Saunders's</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark blue eyes. That, too, was instinctive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the instinctive hatred of the clean for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sullied, of the humanized for the brute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now and then, looking over the negro's</seg><seg type="columnLine">glistening shoulder, his eyes met Saunders's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.

How could an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorant mine boy be expected to know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was impregnated with the same vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">zeal that animated the Puritan and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jesuit?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fourth round was like the third--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second, the first--the same but more of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jenkins, ever laughing, ever joking, showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain reluctance about closing in, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that reluctance only fired Denny to greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">insistence. He would not be denied. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">black could not avoid him, he could not beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">him off. Rocking, gliding, he slipped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a fruitless volley to the head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jenkins had no choice but fight according</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the other's choosing. He had to fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">back or go into a clinch; and his childish</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceit would not allow of that. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be said if he, the champion, were seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be holding on because of Dennis Boone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mere tyro? There were fifteen thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">people out there, some of whom had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">him batter down the best, all of whom had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of it. There were newspaper men--</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends and satellites!--his wife!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not clinch. When he could no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer keep the boy off, he met him shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shoulder, trading body for body. Jake</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jenkins was no coward; only he was hol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His laugh rang out as mellowly, his jokes</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew as fast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Li'l massa, seems to me you is sittin' up</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty late.

That one glance seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">convey perfect understanding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gong rang.

And the brown fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The champion thrust Denny away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang back.

You hear?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denny said nothing. He rocked forward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like an animal Jenkins sprang and struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and struck again. But glove met only</seg><seg type="columnLine">glove. Denny slipped through the blows as</seg><seg type="columnLine">water slips through one's fingers. His chin</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested on the black shoulder, his hands al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ternated upon that one spot just below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breastbone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jenkins thrust him away, crouched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang and struck.

Only Denny</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, for he had felt that black body giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">more and more, and the pants issuing close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his ear had been like low, hurt cries. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">glided in and struck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, as before, the black's body was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed against his, Jenkins's arms circled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, one faction, led by Devil Dave Taggart, lumber king, is working to keep the town lawless so that decent</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, who might investigate his timber operations, will not live there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Richard Hale, Dr. Sanders, and Rose Ilavetis lead the respectable element. But they are losing out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when into the settlement flies Gaston Olaf Francois Thorson, a fighting young giant, of French-Norse de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scent, with his partner, Tom Pine. Gaston saves Miss Havens from the insults of "Red-Skirl" Murphy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader and driver of Taggart's lumbermen, who are derelicts from every camp in the North, working under</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devil Dave's wing, since he will protect them from the law. Gaston whips Murphy in a saloon, which forces</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rose Havens to believe him a common brawler. Gaston is bewildered and angry at this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Gaston hires out to Taggart as boss in Murphy's place. He finds the timber tract about to be cut sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piciously well guarded by Taggart's men; also that back in the woods Devil Dave has a fine house, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">live two women who carouse with him, and who, he tells Gaskin Olaf, are his sister and niece.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Gaston decides Taggart's is no white man's outfit. He and Tom Pine leave it. On their way to Havens</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falls they come upon Hale, who, while trying to approach Taggart's timber territory, has been shot in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg. They rush him to the settlement. There Gaston learns that Devil Dave is really stealing timber owned</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Rose Havens. And he has been aiding in the theft! Gaston goes over to the side of Miss Havens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   When Taggart sends the stolen logsdown-stream that Spring, Gaston captures them all for Rose Havens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a desperate fight. Whereupon Taggart claims he innocently cut her lumber and pays her $25,000 cash</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the mistake. He then accuses Gaston of shooting his henchman Murphy and orders him to leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Gaston leaves, but returns secretly to Havens Falls in time to prevent Murphy, supposedly wounded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from stealing back the $25,000 from Miss Havens, at the instigation of Taggart. Murphy, however, escapes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Taggart vanishes. A capitalist, Lonergan, arrives at the Falls. He plans to build a railroad through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the St. Croix country and open the land for settlers. But first Taggart's gang must be cleaned out. Gaston</seg><seg type="columnLine">is made Town Marshal.

And we didn't have sense enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look for a trail leading out behind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some wine?" smiled the dark woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding forth a glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Or beer?" laughed the blonde. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to get something out of your trip."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston bowed low, cap in hand, in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">very best manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I beg your pardon, ladies. It was a bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistake on our part. We should have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">watched both sides of the house. You may</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell Mr. Taggart that he was too smart for</seg><seg type="columnLine">us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit down," said the dark woman, smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">her best. "There's no use chasing him; he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">got away by now. Won't you have some</seg><seg type="columnLine">wine?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With the little knockout-drops in? No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanks. You've already gained a few min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes for Taggart, though. So we must bid</seg><seg type="columnLine">you good-by."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little blonde made one bid to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">them longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Geel Big man. I believe I could leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taggart for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good-night. I'm sorry-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw that the girl was laughing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">something and glanced toward the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taggart, standing outside, was leaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the sill, carefully covering Gaston and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom with a double - barreled shot - gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no need for speech. Gaston and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom were too experienced to take chances</seg><seg type="columnLine">with such wicked, business - like eyes as</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed at them over the barrels. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">life or death, the decision to be made in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">split second, and they froze stiff, their rifles</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging harmlessly under their arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right." Taggart's fangs showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he smiled. He had been drinking. "A</seg><seg type="columnLine">move and--well, we won't speak of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have happened. The--the tables</seg><seg type="columnLine">are slightly turned, aren't they, Thorson?</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're not the big man just at present. No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just now you look like an ordinary whipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog. And, like every dog who gets in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, you've had your day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston's eyes looked down the gun-bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rel into the eyes of Taggart. There in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible, silent conflict of wills the issue was</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, Taggart! You've had your last</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to get me out of your way." Gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's voice rang with the fiber of triumph.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Pull that trigger. Touch her off. Blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head off. That's your only chance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And that's gone now. It was gone the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond after you got the drop. You could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done it then, while our backs were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. You can't do it now. Your chance is</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone--see? You can't look me in the eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">and do it. It isn't in you, Taggart. You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying, but it won't work. You're done for.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Your chance is gone. I'll drive you out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country now. Look at his gun wobbling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Look! Look!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston Olaf</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">149</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a flash he threw himself backward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocking Tom Pine under him. His long</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs flew out, kicking the table smack into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window where Taggart stood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shotgun roared ineffectually. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">big kerosene lamp on the table exploded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flirting liquid flame about the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a hell's medley of flame and</seg><seg type="columnLine">screams, of cursing and scrambling, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women blindly threw themselves about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape the flames. Tom and Gaston thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">the women to safety through the open door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and running into the next room made their</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape through a rear window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Into the brush!" commanded Gaston.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Indian's around somewhere. He'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a shotgun,too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From a hiding-placc in the brush they</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked back at the clearing. The cottage</seg><seg type="columnLine">was spouting flame at every window. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing was brilliantly illuminated, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light revealed no trace of Taggart or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women. Apparently they had fled the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment that it was certain that the cottage</seg><seg type="columnLine">was doomed, not wishing to be found by</seg><seg type="columnLine">any one whom the flames might draw from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The same thought was in Gaston's mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, when it became apparent that the dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger from Taggart's shotgun was passed, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught Tom by the arm and led the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the timber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On a ridge a mile away they dropped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground and lay looking back. Up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark sky hung a red-tinted pall, the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flection of the burning building. In that</seg><seg type="columnLine">waste of dead, black forest the scene was</seg><seg type="columnLine">appalling, an angry splotch of passion in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea of peace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Higher and fiercer rose the flames, licking</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly at the rich furnishings of the den,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and redder and larger grew the glow in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. The fire rose rapidly to its climax,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spouted high as the roof fell in, then gradu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally began to subside, while minute by min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute the nightly gloom of the forest crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly back to its own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good enough," said Gaston at last.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's a good sign. Taggart's been burnt</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of one of his dirty nests. May the good</seg><seg type="columnLine">work go on!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom Pine was rubbing his brow in per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plexity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What happened?" he demanded. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">for did you go to rile him up so sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den, Gaston Olaf? We might 'a' got hurt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was our only chance. We had to rat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tle him. He got mad; I saw by his eyes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd loosened his trigger grip. Then I drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped and kicked the table. I had the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked out fine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pretty fine," agreed Tom dubiously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's the closest I ever heard buck-shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistle past this old head. If it had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">any finer-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wouldn't have made a move," Gaston</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed. "We certainly didn't come away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from there with any credit, Tom. Walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it with our eyes wide open and blind."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ye-es. It wasn't so bad, though; we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were able to walk out again. We didn't take</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything away, but we didn't leave any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, either. Now, what next?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll keep on walking. The chances</seg><seg type="columnLine">are Taggart'll have his sheriff and posse out</seg><seg type="columnLine">here looking for us as soon as he can send</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em word. They'll search this neck of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods pretty close, and there'll be too many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 'em for us; so we'll travel. Come on!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He set out, picking his way dexterously</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the dark woods, at a good pace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tom followed obediently. The course</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay straight westward for two miles, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank of a small creek running north and</seg><seg type="columnLine">south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's where we lose 'em when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to follow us," said Gaston and plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom followed. They went down-stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short distance and came out upon a sand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar, leaving their tracks large and plain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing westward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After losing their trail in a swamp they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reentered the creek and waded up-stream for</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a mile to where a tangled windfall per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted them to quit the stream, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastern side, without touching the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">and making tracks. Their course now lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastward and slightly to the north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They traveled steadily for most of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. Shortly before daybreak they</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched for and found a small, well-built</seg><seg type="columnLine">shanty in the midst of a good growth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">timber. Tom Pine laughed as they entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, by feeling, found matches where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left them the day they started for Ha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vens Falls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Home again!" he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Gaston. "We'll lay low on</seg><seg type="columnLine">our claims here for a couple of days. We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit back to town to be there Saturday night."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Saturday night? Why then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because then I figure the pot'll be about</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to boil over."</seg><seg type="columnLine">150</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXVin</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SATURDAY NIGHT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS drive-time on the La Croix; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pay-day for the camps; and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Saturday night in Havens Falls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For such nights existed the river-fronts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">river towns in the bad old days; on such</seg><seg type="columnLine">nights was made the lurid history that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered even now, when river towns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they were, have ceased to exist. Mad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glorious nights after sober days of bone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">testing toil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one who has seen a river town on such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a night will ever forget it, even though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">recollection is accompanied by a shudder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the men came in off the drive, wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the water which had snatched at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives during the day, mad with the hunger</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a night's excitement before going back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their toil. Then from out of the woods</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the camp-men in bodily condition like</seg><seg type="columnLine">unto a prize-fighter in training, mentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">akin to bucks in rutting time, prowling</seg><seg type="columnLine">about for a chance to fight. There assem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled on such occasions dozens of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">daring, reckless, muscular men who ever in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">habited this continent. In their pockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">they carried money running often into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the right and left the red lights blink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, and music tinkled, advertising the things</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the river-front had to give in exchange</seg><seg type="columnLine">for money. Supply follows the demand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whisky and women; lights and music; gam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling and association with their kind; noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strife--these were the things that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement-hungry woodsmen craved, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">these were the things that the river-front</seg><seg type="columnLine">brazenly announced itself ready to supply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a mud-chinked log building, with trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying at its back door, one found a gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, polished dancefloor, where, by stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in line, and for a price, one might dance</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a tiny blonde, with the features of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madonna and the eyes of a snake. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtained boxes lumber-jacks had the privi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lege of ordering the same brands of cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pagne that wine - agents advertise along</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broadway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old lumber-jacks, mackinawed and shoe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">packed, beards reeking with tobacco-juice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but pockets filled with money, staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the floor, holding in their arms girls</seg><seg type="columnLine">young enough to be their daughters. Young</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacks, slim, clean-eyed boys, spent their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">money on painted things old enough to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">their mothers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next door one could gamble at anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">from chuck-luck to roulette. Any lumber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jack who by accident won a few dollars, cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culated to hold his winnings by the strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his good right arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But these devices of pleasure were but</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplements to whisky. It was the bars</seg><seg type="columnLine">over which liquor was served that drew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and furnished reasons for the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">things; and it was in the bare saloons that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greatest crowds were to be found and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most violent actions indulged in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On this Saturday night, while Gaston and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom Pine were wending their way to town,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were probably a hundred and fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">men from the woods in Havens Falls. Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">McCarthy's saloon, being the largest in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">settlement, drew the largest part of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">number.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McCarthy was experienced in such occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions, and he knew that serious rows were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no source of profit to his till. Hence, early</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the evening, he seated himself on a stool</seg><seg type="columnLine">just inside the door. Twenty-five per cent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lumber-jacks came into town bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifles. As such a one entered McCarthy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">place the proprietor crooked a finger and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed at a corner behind the bar. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumber-jack promptly placed his weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the others deposited there. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were twoscore rifles behind McCarthy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar that night before the fun had fairly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston and Tom entered the settlement</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly after dark and at once made their</seg><seg type="columnLine">way unobserved into Dr. Sanders's back</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. The doctor greeted them with great</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise and greater relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Boys--boys! I'd almost lost hope of</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing you again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why so?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For good and sufficient reasons. First,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of the way you disappeared with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out leaving any word. That worried me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I figured you might have done that for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a reason. But when the sheriff and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang went hunting you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh! They did hunt for us, then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hunt for you? Boys, they certainly did.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They made a sudden raid on the hotel, sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded it and forced their way in. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gone. As near as I could figure it</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd been gone about twenty minutes when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the raid came. Then they searched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town. They-"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston Olaf</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did they go up there?" Gaston nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direction of the Havens home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They did. Miss Rose invited the sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go through and see that you weren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding there. She told him you wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide from a man like him. Yes, they went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the whole town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then that night they got word and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the bush after you. I heard that they'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard where you were. Then they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and said they'd run you out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, and boys, I was--hm, hm--I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid they'd caught you and put you out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of business. And, say, somebody else was</seg><seg type="columnLine">worrying, too, and I think you ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show yourself up there as soon as you can."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right. And what's happened since</seg><seg type="columnLine">then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, the sheriff and most of his gang</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone back to La Croix.

There are a lot of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in town who haven't any use for Taggart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although they've been in his camps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's the crew from Camp One, forty men</seg><seg type="columnLine">or more, just paid off. They've heard about</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you did to that drive, and Taggart</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't show himself without getting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">merry ha-ha! There have been half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">small riots already.

It was a warm, dark</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	night and in his rubber - soled</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes he made no more noise than a cat as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came swiftly up to the door. The door</seg><seg type="columnLine">was open, as was a window at one side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The front room was brightly lighted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston could not help looking in, and hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing looked could not help hearing what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being said. It halted him, and he stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking and listening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hale was in the room with Rose and Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Havens. Hale was on his feet, speaking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his strong, round face wore a look of</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think you ought to go. If I had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power I would make you go. This is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for you to stay here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you going away, too?" asked Rose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Of course not. That's different. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's no reason why you should stay. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't tell what they'll do before morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll give you my team and a driver and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can go down to La Croix and wait until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing blows over."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rose smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you will drive us, Dick-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, you know I can't do that. A man</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't run away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But a woman--a girl--can?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Certainly. That's common sense."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We're going to stay here, Dick." Rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very quiet. "I know how well you</seg><seg type="columnLine">152</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mean it--but we will not run away."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bravo!" cried Gaston, striding in. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">started at the sight of him; but Gaston</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked only at Rose, and his heart swelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the look she gave him. "I apologize for</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing what wasn't intended for my ears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was just coming in. Miss Havens, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you here we know we must keep Taggart's</seg><seg type="columnLine">outfit away from this end of town; and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we must, we can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laughed as he spoke. His spirits were</seg><seg type="columnLine">at top crest. The situation, the opportunity</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight to protect Rose, was like wine to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his blood. It lifted him, made his heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat madly. He felt strong enough to fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world; he had a mad impulse to go forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">singing, to battle single-handed with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang in its lairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then he remembered. Those mad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">joyous, impractical impulses and actions</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no longer for him. That was past.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For him, sober, respectable, practical effort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heaved a sigh as he noted that Rose's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were comparing him to Hale. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparison scarcely could be favorable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he knew. His fringed buckskin trou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sers, high-top rubbers, flaming red sash and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carelessly buttoned shirt were in dire con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trast to Hale's neat store-clothes. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods, the odds would have been in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">favor; here it was obviously Hale who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the better of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they questioned him about his ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sence and return, Gaston made a mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">note that he would change to "town clothes"</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as the opportunity offered. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he must hold himself in, must sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">press those reckless impulses, and make</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself into a regular respectable citizen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can win her," whispered Gaston's in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinct. "But I've got to tame myself--I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to quiet down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a beginning he reconsidered his words</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerning Hale's suggestion that Rose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mother leave town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps it would be the right thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do," he suggested; but Rose laughed at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden change of front.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we had decided to stay before you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were here, certainly we won't change our</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds now that you've come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said Gaston dubiously, "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. It's always best to be safe, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd surely be safer down at La Croix than</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rose thanked him with a look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm very glad to hear you talk in that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tone," she said, "but I'm sure you don't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">really think there's any danger to us here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Do you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"As Hale says, you'd surely be safe in La</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Croix," he replied evasively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But as you said, since we're going to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stay here, we'll be assured safety. So here</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we stay."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Hale presently excused himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I want to see Lonergan," he explained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Hello!" exclaimed Gaston. "Lonergan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes. He's here with half-a-dozen men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He's preparing to lay out his line between</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">La Croix and here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That will help. That means seven more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">men on our side."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes. Good men, too. I must tell Loner-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gan you're back in town."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Gaston left the house soon after Hale,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and Rose followed him to the gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well," he said in parting, "you see I'm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">living up to my promise to change my ways.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I ran away and hid when the sheriff's gang</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was after me, and I've been avoiding trouble</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ever since."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I am glad," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"So am I. I'm glad that--that you want-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ed me to change."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Without thinking what he did, his fingers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strayed down and reached her hand. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the thrill that went through them both</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the touch, he came to himself and drew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his hand away. He had no right to do that,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or think of it--yet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Good night," he said suddenly. "I must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Promise me you'll be careful this eve-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ning? That you won't do anything--wild?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Nothing wild," he said solemnly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That's all over. I'll prove to you that it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is. Don't you believe it is?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I hope -- yes, I believe it is. Good</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Good night, and--I'll remember."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He meant it. He really felt that he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tamed. But he was soon to learn how bad-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ly he was mistaken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXIX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A FIGHT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS GASTON went back toward Dr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Sanders's office there came up from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">river-front a muffled roar of rage and disap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pointment that froze him in his tracks, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston Olaf</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">153</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he stood looking down toward where men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">surged wildly to and fro in the gleam of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lights from opened windows and doors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Something had happened down there that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had brought sudden anger to a large num-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ber of the crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The shouting came from one of the larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloons, and after the first sudden explosion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of anger there followed an insistent clamor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently for revenge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ever since he had heard from Dr. San-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders that a large percentage of the men in</seg><seg type="columnLine">town were laughing at Taggart and his gang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the gang was growling over it, Gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton had been imbued with a wild hope: if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two elements would get to fighting each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, the gang would be too busy to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">seriously on the decent people of the town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had just promised Rose that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be careful; and to stand to one side and let</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two sides fight among themselves was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the height of caution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At first he had planned to go down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrest Red-Shirt Murphy before the eyes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friends, casting the challenge of law and</seg><seg type="columnLine">order in their teeth. But this would inevi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tably have precipitated a conflict between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gang and the decent citizens. So now</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he moVed alone down toward the river-</seg><seg type="columnLine">front, without troubling to call for Tom, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in his mind only to conduct'a secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">scouting expedition and ascertain, if possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble, whether there was a prospect that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two elements in the crowd would clash in</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle. If so, he and the other respectable</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizens of Havens Falls had only to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves to their upper part of town and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pray that the outsiders would lick Tag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gart's men to the last whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In this cautious frame of mind, Gaston,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aided by the dark night, soon was mingling</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the crowd before the building whence</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the clamor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the row here, neighbor?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, keeping his face averted from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger whom he addressed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Oh, he just knocked another of our boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">colder'n a dead fish," was the nonchalant</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Who did?" asked Gaston carelessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Before his informant could reply there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a shout from the doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gangway there--gangway! Open up, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he can get some air."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Shouldering and cursing, their faces cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ugly with rage, came two middle-aged</seg><seg type="columnLine">woodsmen dragging between them the limp,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody figure of a curly-headed youth. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy was nearly as big as Gaston. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men carried him, each holding him up by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arms, his head rolling drunkenly, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet dragging helplessly on the ground. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was smashed red and raw, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a cruel gash in the back of his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Outside the crowd, which only glanced at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and turned away to view what was go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on in the saloon, they laid him down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and splashed water in his face. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a dozen in the circle about him, tried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard-bitten men of the woods, and Gaston</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that they were all strangers to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's got his gloves loaded," muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the battered youth, as consciousness re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned. "I tell you there's lead in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloves of his."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut up!" commanded one of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had carried him out. "Doesn't make</seg><seg type="columnLine">any difference if there was dynamite in 'em;</seg><seg type="columnLine">we said we could find a man to lick him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boys," he turned to the little group, "how</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it? Are we going to let that dam</seg><seg type="columnLine">prize-fighter brag about licking three of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys without anybody getting him?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lemme go back at him!" pleaded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth. "I was half stewed when I got into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring with him. Head's cleared now; I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can handle him now, boys."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can't handle yourself--lay downl</seg><seg type="columnLine">You handled your mitts like a Swede."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We got to get him licked," growled an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other man. "We can't hold up our heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we don't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston's blood leaped quickly.

"Get some one. Who can we</seg><seg type="columnLine">get?

Holy, suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fering Moses! Anybody. Let's go hunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They started back toward the crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on, boys."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They swung back. Gaston had stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the darkness and was standing beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fallen youth. With one glance of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp eyes those woodsmen appraised him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then they came toward him, respectfully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's going on, boys?" asked Gaston.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Some champion in town?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">154</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They looked him over in silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Stranger," exploded their spokesman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"can you handle your mitts at all?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Have done so," replied Gaston.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's up?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A knocker-out in Sam's Place.

The place was crowded with men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the farther end of the room was a tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage, on which usually singers and dancers</seg><seg type="columnLine">held forth. Tonight two ropes were stretch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed across the front of the stage. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">side walls and a canvas drop at the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">constituted the other three sides of the ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the haze of tobacco - smoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which hung like clouds about the hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">oil-lamps, Gaston could make out the figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fighter leaning over the ropes, gloves</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his hands, sneering at the crowd, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his side a hawk-nosed gambler cried:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come on, boys; bring up your fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">men!

Haven't you got a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good man?" howled the fighter's partisans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You darn know it!" came back the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply from the door, and Gaston Olaf and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">six new-found friends came rushing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room to the ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a vague, far-away sort of fashion Gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton Olaf realized that he had taken upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself a desperate venture. A small, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice was whispering to him that this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dangerous thing to do; that Taggart's men</seg><seg type="columnLine">would recognize him; that they would seek</seg><seg type="columnLine">to collect the price which he knew Taggart</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have set on his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the voice was so small that he scarce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly heard it; the realization of danger came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him from far away and as through a fog.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What he realized keenly was that his veins</seg><seg type="columnLine">were throbbing with excitement. And now</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the spur of the moment he realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this was what his nature craved above</seg><seg type="columnLine">all things, that he had stepped into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">present dangerous position because his real</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature had led him to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These thoughts came and went in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled flash. Then he was the old reck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, dare-devil Gaston, glorying in the pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er of his young giant's body, thrilled to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">core by the prospect of the fight ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He laughed boyishly; he was happy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a moment of stillness as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed through the ropes. Taggart's men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston Olaf</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">155</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">recognizing him, were awed to silence by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his audacity at appearing in such a place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the outsiders broke into a whoop and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded forward, clamoring to bet what re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained of their rolls on this new champion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pugilist looked Gaston over with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible grimace, intended for a smile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">contempt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Deh bigger dey are, deh harder dey fall,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he barked. "Give 'im deh mitts, ref'ree.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's in fer an orful tumble, dis guy is.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here, feel o' my gloves, so yah won't holler</seg><seg type="columnLine">dere's lead in 'em when I knock yah cold."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Gaston felt of the thin gloves.

Gaston was puzzled at the obvious</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence of the professional and the gam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bler. By their faces the fight was only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">formality; it was as good as over, with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as another victim of the pug's prowess.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why was this? His keenly alert instinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly cried out a warning. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something wrong here; he must be on guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a trick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on!" bellowed the gambler. "Any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body else want to back the big fellow against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little Butcher Boy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston, leaning against the ropes in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner, was watching the crowd. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Red-Shirt Murphy whispering with another</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on!" he cried. "Let's get start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hi! D'you know who that big stiff is?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried the man to whom Murphy had spoken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't know and don't care," replied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's Thorson--that's the guy who</seg><seg type="columnLine">stole the drive!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The room was still for an instant. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston's backers lifted the roof with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">shout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hoop-la! Thorson! Bully boy! Clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">him up like you cleaned Devil Dave. Eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">'im alive!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pugilist grinned, and the gambler</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked bored. It was apparent that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">cared not in the least about who Gaston</seg><seg type="columnLine">was; all comers looked alike to them. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">could the trick be that made them so con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fident?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston looked swiftly around the ring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ropes in front were all right; there could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be no trick there. The sides were bare</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">walls, all right. The rear was a sheet of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston felt a slight chill along his spine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his breath came sharply. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">two tiny holes cut in the curtain, so tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in the poor light it required eyes as</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp as his to see them. And for a flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he looked, then instantly disappearing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there showed behind each hole a watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something wrong behind that curtain,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston mused. "I'll keep away from it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">His thrill at the prospect of combat sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly changed and gave place to a cold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seething rage. They would try an unfair</seg><seg type="columnLine">trick on him, would they! His jaw set and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes flashed fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, you cheap, dirty crook!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hissed. "I'll spoil your circus and break</seg><seg type="columnLine">your head besides."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No more bets?

"Then we'll give it to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go!" shouted the gambler and leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IKB THE crowd surged forward, pack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jjiiiuu ing tightly against the ropes. Gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton had a flash of the first row, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing half a dozen of Taggart's men there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that more trouble awaited him when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fight was over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had little time to think of this. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighter came at him like a whirlwind. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only a feint. Gaston led, the pug duck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, and Gaston suddenly found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinched and shoved toward the curtain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He broke the clinch without any trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fighter feinted and clinched again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This time he had a hold about the middle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a heave he lifted Gaston from the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rushed him against the canvas hanging.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston threw himself forward even as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back touched the curtain and in that instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secret of the fighter's success was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed to him. A blow as from an ax took</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on one side of the neck, but his for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward movement had taken him too far</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to permit the blow to land with full</seg><seg type="columnLine">force. As it was it knocked him to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees. Stars flew around his head; he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">nauseated, for a moment. And then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on his feet, with a berserk bellow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pug struck wildly, right and left, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and ran. Gaston caught him at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropes. He grappled him neck and thigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swung him over his head, roaring deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in his chest. Without a flicker of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitation the gambler reached for his gun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to be dropped by the fists of two Crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">One men who had been watching him for</seg><seg type="columnLine">just such action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston steadied himself with the squirm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing man held above his head. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good ten feet across the ring. Gaston hurl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed his victim straight through the air into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canvas. The curtain ripped and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, and the two black-jack men behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were exposed with their weapons in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There!" cried Gaston.

Was it possible?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had these town crooks really had the nerve</seg><seg type="columnLine">to play such a trick on Crew One? For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment they gaped; then they swore soft-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly and swarmed toward the ring. A num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of the gangsters made the mistake of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to halt them and hold them back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hoop-la!" cried the woodsmen, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room full of men exploded in battle royal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The small ring became a place where a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen men were struggling instead of two.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down on the floor twoscore men met fist to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist. The outsiders were in the majority,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were out to avenge the unfair tac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tics by which their men had been beaten,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the taunts hurled at them, and the tempo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rary loss of their money--temporary, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause four of them stripped the gambler</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the last yellow diamond on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the ring Gaston fought furiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">against odds until the rush of his friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried his foes underfoot. He was marked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he soon was satisfied with his share of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the struggle, and he managed to free him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self for a moment from the press.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The outsiders by this time had the whip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and the fight had become knock-down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-drag-out. Taggart's gangsters were be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hurled through doors and windows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Later they would return with reinforce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments and the battle would be renewed, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for the time being the fight was all to Crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">One.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was no part of Gaston's program to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take part in a general rough-house. He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alized how greatly fortune had favored him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his desperate venture, and returning</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmness dictated that he escape. In a jam</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the door he caught sight of the flaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper garment of Red-Shirt Murphy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Murphy was cornered by two young lum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber-jacks who were polishing him off to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">queen's taste. A smile flitted over Gaston's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, and he dropped into the melee on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. It was the work of a few seconds to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work his way through to the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let him go, boys," he commanded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutching Murphy's arm. "He's my meat."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right, champeen," they said, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to hunt a fresh victim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leggo me!" growled Murphy. "Hey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taggart's men, here's Thorson. Knife him,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody, knife the-!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston twisted his arm behind him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust him outside. Two of Murphy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends came running toward him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Out of the way," said Gaston. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">arresting Murphy for robbing that kid this</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening. I'm marshal of this town. Pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon I'll come back and get some more of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Out of the way. Hike!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a dog-trot he propelled Murphy ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him out of the crowd and up the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before any one dared to make a move. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazed gangsters stood dumfounded while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston ran his prisoner across the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">space separating the two parts of town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was in front of Hale's store before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved. Then they shouted:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hi! Thorson's gobbled Red Shirt and's</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying him off. Come here to me. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to get Red Shirt away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston threw his prisoner into Hale's</seg><seg type="columnLine">store.

"First one across</seg><seg type="columnLine">it gets what's in the old gun. Who wants</seg><seg type="columnLine">it first?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gang stopped short. In the yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">flare of light Gaston was not a pleasant ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject to face. There was blood on his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the fight; his shirt was torn in several</seg><seg type="columnLine">places; his thick crop of hair was disordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">till each hair seemed to be standing on end.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And in the half-light his blue eyes gleamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">wickedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was very serious. There was no joy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of battle about this. This was business,</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty. It was something that had to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done, and he happened to be the man on</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom the job of doing it had fallen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's the line," he said. "That's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line that marks the coming of law and order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Havens Falls.

Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you understand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston sensed that people were moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him from behind. He looked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that in the darkness at his back a crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gathered to his support. Nearest him</seg><seg type="columnLine">were Tom Pine, Lonergan and Hale. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them was armed with a shotgun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Sanders, Perkins, Lonergan's men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and others were there, too, bringing the to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal number up to ten, all armed. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">came silently, stretching across the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a ragged line. It was a new business to</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of them; their faces were white and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were breathing hard. But within them</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the spirit of the town-makers, the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">of homes, who bring order into the wilder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was something that had to be done</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the good of the town. Before them were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forces of lawlessness and disorder, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they and theirs had suffered helpless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly for so long. Behind them were their</seg><seg type="columnLine">homes, their women, their children--all that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was sacred in the world to them. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time had come for them to stand out be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween these and the forces of evil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They didn't like to do it; fighting wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their line. But it had to be done. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were doing it. And Taggart's gang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sters looked at the silent line of white faces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the formidable figure that led them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grew weak. As always, the bravado</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage of the bad man was as the reckless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of a boy in the face of the calm deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mination of law-abiding citizens defending</seg><seg type="columnLine">their homes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two sides faced each other in silence;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then Gaston's voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now toddle back to your boss.

The gangsters</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to slink back one by one. They went</seg><seg type="columnLine">with curses on their lips.

He did not laugh at the threat which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been hurled at them. The mood of</seg><seg type="columnLine">recklessness had passed; he was as coldly</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious and determined as the most sober</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizen present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, we've served notice on them now,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes ran swiftly up and down the line</seg><seg type="columnLine">and suddenly he was filled with a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride at the thought of being chosen leader</seg><seg type="columnLine">by such men. With the exception of Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pine and a couple of reckless youngsters in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lonergan's crew, the business in hand was</seg><seg type="columnLine">appalling to his followers. They were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of violence; they were men with a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger for orderly communities. Some of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually were sick at stomach from the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed sensations of the situation. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">not one of them but plainly told by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">158</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">look on his face that he was ready to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and give life itself if necessary in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the new rule of law and &lt;?rder might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be established.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To Gaston, who always deprecated his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own courage because the prospect of trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">only filled him with joy, there was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing heroic in the courage of these quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizens. He saw them in a new light--es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecially Hale. Hale was handling his shot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun clumsily, but his eyes were as steady as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston's or Tom Pine's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Lonergan, "we've served 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice. Now they've either got to pull their</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel or back down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They*-won't back down," said Hale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Taggart won't let 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nope." Old Perkins was nervously</seg><seg type="columnLine">chewing tobacco. "Nope, they won't back</seg><seg type="columnLine">down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Neither will we," said another man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," they said, almost as one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did you do with Murphy?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put him in a shack back of the post-</seg><seg type="columnLine">office with two men to guard him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stood looking down toward the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights. It was quiet down there, but Gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton knew what trouble was boiling, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubts assailed him as he considered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible results to these men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have I done right, boys?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've done right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've brought trouble coming to you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It had to come sometime. Better now</seg><seg type="columnLine">than later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right. They won't be back here for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little time at least. Let's go to Hale's</seg><seg type="columnLine">store and decide what to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the light of the store-lamps they saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blood on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey!" cried Dr. Sanders. "I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">there'd be work for me tonight, but I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">think it would start so soon. How'd you</seg><seg type="columnLine">get that? Come here while I fix you up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who gave it to you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston opened his mouth to tell of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight in the saloon, but stopped. Looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">back upon it he saw suddenly how desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reckless had been his adventure. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same instant he remembered how, but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short time ago, he had promised to be care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful this night. He felt ashamed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Murphy's friends," he replied evasively,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bending over the basin which the doctor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought. "It doesn't amount to anything."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Amounts to this," snapped Tom Pine,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"you sneaked off and hogged the fun after</seg><seg type="columnLine">promising to let me in on it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't worry; there'll be plenty more fun</seg><seg type="columnLine">before this night's over. Now, let's put our</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads together. I've arrested Murphy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's our first prisoner. Those fellows will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be after him, sure as we're living.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Murphy's nothing but a big bum, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best thing to do with him is to kick him</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of town; but for the present he's impor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant. We've got to keep him as a warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to 'em. So I guess there won't be much</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep for any of us tonight. Those fellows</seg><seg type="columnLine">will try to nose around and find out where</seg><seg type="columnLine">we've got him. We've got to meet them</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that line out there and persuade 'em to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep on their own side of the fence."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Right. You're the boss; give your or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I think this store is a good place</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us to make camp in," said Gaston.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How many more men can we get together</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we can depend upon?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A silence fell over the room. Hale broke</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Counting the two men guarding Mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phy, we're most of us here. There's three</seg><seg type="columnLine">or four men more will be here later. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are some away who won't be back to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. Count on an even dozen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"A dozen?" repeated Gaston cheerfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, we'll have to make that do, then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll raise-, you will!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A voice in the doorway brought the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of them to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll raise-and put a foundation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">under it, you will!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taggart was standing there, his bulk fill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the doorway. He was all alone. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was stiff-eyed from whisky; his fang-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth showed through his ragged beard in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leering grin; and he stood leaning forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his huge hands curved before him like claws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sudden sight of him sent a chill down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back of most of those present. They re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alized fully now what they had to combat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Taggart," said Gaston easily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where's your shotgun?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taggart's head dropped further forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his grin grew wider, and if ever eyes flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire his blood-shot optics did then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thorson, if I was bothering about you</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more I'd have brought a shotgun," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said thickly. "But you're--you're only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog in a flock now, one cur in a crowd! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've decided to whip the whole lot of you</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston Olaf</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">159</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">out of my country. Do you hear?" His</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice suddenly rose to a demoniacal shout</seg><seg type="columnLine">that shook the lamps under the ceiling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The whole lot of you, curs--dogs, bitches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pups! Yes, and your kennels, too. You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">all going together. Back up Thorson, will</seg><seg type="columnLine">you? Follow him because he's dared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">buck me, eh? Ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Buck me!" he repeated in a whisper, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face swelling horribly. Suddenly he swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm before him as if brushing something</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of his way, and stepped back a step.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All of you -- whipped dogs -- get away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Take your women and kids and travel. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">there'll be no kennels for you to bed down</seg><seg type="columnLine">in when daylight comes in the morning!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was gone, lurching back out of sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the darkness as suddenly as he had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men in the store looked at one an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. Old Perkins's shrill treble rose:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, the dirty-1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they all looked at Gaston. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor had halted in the act of putting stick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-plaster on a cut on his cheek, and Gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton was calmly completing the operation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well--darn it, Doc, this stuff won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick. Well, boys, now Devil Dave has</seg><seg type="columnLine">served notice on us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no reply; they were watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. By his calmness they sensed that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was confident that the solution of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem lay with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wha--what did he mean?" gasped a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-faced man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mean?" said Gaston. "Huh! That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy; he means that he's going to burn us</seg><seg type="columnLine">out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXXII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE POWER OF WOMAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A MOMENT of horror-stricken silence</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    followed Gaston's words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, the dirty-!" repeated old Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Burn us out? Good God! He wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare do that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You saw him, didn't you?" said Gaston.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Did he look like a man who'd stop at any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lonergan shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He'll do it--if he can. He's done things</seg><seg type="columnLine">like it before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Tom Pine cleared his throat noisily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I could have shot him right where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood," he said, puzzled. "I had my gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">right here. And I was thinking: 'You</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked old whelp, I'll do one good thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this world and rid it of you.' But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't do it. Darn your law and order!</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's making me soft, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" demanded Perkins. "What are</seg><seg type="columnLine">we going to do now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep him from doing it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston looked his men over. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be twelve of them, all told. Taggart</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have ftfty. Gaston moved swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Boys, there aren't enough of us," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply. "We couldn't possibly keep 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">from getting fires started. Everything is</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry as kindling. If a fire once gets hold here</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, everything goes. So we've got to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em from getting started. To do that we've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to have more men. And--you fellows</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay right here. I'm going out and try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom Pine made to rise, but Gaston was</seg><seg type="columnLine">away on the run. He knew that he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">act and get results swiftly if at all. And as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ran by a roundabout way for Sam's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Place he shook his head at the queer turn of</seg><seg type="columnLine">events. For if he was to save Havens Falls</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must do it because of his carelessness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston knew lumberjacks. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the men whose champion he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for whom he had exposed the methods</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crooked pugilist, were, for the evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least, his sworn friends. They would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked nothing better than to hoist him on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their shoulders, parade the town with him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fill him up on all the liquors that the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">afforded. Could he halt them in their wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">career of the evening and turn their hero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worship to serious ends?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He approached Sam's Place cautiously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping in the dark. Inside the outsiders</seg><seg type="columnLine">were holding sway. The saloon - keeper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager for their patronage now that they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">their money back, had helped them kick</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighter, gambler and knockout-men into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street, and the place was in their hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston waited until one of the older men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who first had spoken to him, came out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment's air. Him he caught by the arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drew to one side out of the light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My name's McKenzie, boy," insisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man, "and I'm going to buy you a drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">or-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, McKenzie--but not just now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I need friends."</seg><seg type="columnLine">i6o</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put 'er there!" cried McKenzie, shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. "Now, lead the way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I need a lot of friends. This is serious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">McKenzie. It's life or death for me--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly some men and women and chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McKenzie sobered immediately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's forty men in our crew," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"After that fight we're with you to a man."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, for God's sake, McKenzie, round</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em up! Tell 'em it's against that gang. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">they're white men tell 'em this is the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show it. Pass the word on the quiet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and get 'em up to the big store--Hale's store</seg><seg type="columnLine">--as soon as you can. And you can prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ise them a fight that will make anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">they've ever been in look foolish. Do this</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, if you want to square up for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Nough said. I was their foreman all</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winter. I'll have 'em there in a hurry, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm a Swede."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston hurried back to the store. Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">more scared-looking but determined men</seg><seg type="columnLine">had joined the crowd, so there now were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen decent citizens to oppose Taggart's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang. Gaston looked them over and sucked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his lips. He had just seen the river-front</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarming with the gangsters. Fifty of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would be, and they were a tough, hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitten crew. Futile to oppose them with</seg><seg type="columnLine">these soft-muscled townsmen. If McKen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zie's men failed him-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're coming!" came the shout from</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hoop-la!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first of McKenzie's crew came tum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling into the room, half a dozen of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with big Erik in the lead. They swarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Gaston Olaf, thrusting the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside. One man held toward him a roll of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bills; two held forth bottles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's your share of the winnings, ol'</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear. We chipped in. Take it. We won</seg><seg type="columnLine">on you. Take a drink, too." '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston drank sparingly from each bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and accepted the bills. They would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken it as an insult had he refused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now that's all the booze we'll touch for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the present, boys," said he. "And this roll</seg><seg type="columnLine">will pay for a little celebration afterward."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chaffing them, shaking the hands that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were outstretched to him, laughing heartily</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they smote him affectionately on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and called him endearing and profane</seg><seg type="columnLine">names, he received them as they came tum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling into the store. They were eager to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">come, eager to shake his hand. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had stolen the Taggart drive, and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of that given them sweet revenge on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slugger, was for this night their hero,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their great man of the world. On the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, they were in town to celebrate, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this store and this crowd looked like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty dry place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's the excitement, Thorson?" they</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried. "Stir 'er up! This looks too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">like church for us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When McKenzie came hurrying in at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of a dozen men, bringing the number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this crew present up to thirty, Gaston</seg><seg type="columnLine">held up his hand for silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Boys," he began seriously, "we want</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to join us. We need your help!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who's 'we'? " demanded a voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't make no difference who 'tis,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped McKenzie. "There's a man we</seg><seg type="columnLine">owe our shirts to. You listen to him."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The gang that's been bucking you fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows all evening is fixing to burn this end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of town," continued Gaston. He talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly, for he saw that this sober sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting was not to the taste of the joyous</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumberjacks, and he feared he might lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hold. "That gang is Taggart's. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how they've run things around here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This end of town is where the white people</seg><seg type="columnLine">live in this settlement. There are women</seg><seg type="columnLine">and babies in these houses, boys; and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang is fixing to burn 'em out. If we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men we can't stand by and see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">done. We need you boys with us; we aren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to protect those women and kids</seg><seg type="columnLine">without you. What do you say? Are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men? Will you stick with us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep that gang from getting up into this</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of town?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the silence that followed his speech</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston knew the men were not won. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild, unbroken colts the lumberjacks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">balking. Had he gaily placed himself at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their head and led them to clean out a saloon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would have followed without a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment's hesitation. But they balked at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">sober appeal for help to guard the houses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">towns people against fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where the - is the fun in that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">growled one. "Come on; let's go back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a drink."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go ahead!" cried Gaston, flaring an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grily. "Go get your drink; you probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be any good anyhow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't tear your shirt, Noisy," spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">McKenzie, his hand on the man's shoulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston Olaf</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">161</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Stay right here. But lemme tell you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thorson, this isn't exactly what we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Afraid?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come off, man; don't get on your horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">just because we don't fall over ourselves to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go with you. There's some of us with wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and kids, too; and we get a living for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them on Taggart's pay-roll. There'd be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more work in this country for a man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">bucked Taggart's gang too hard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this Lonergan thrust his square figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside Gaston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, well, if it ain't Old Iron Trail!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted an old jack. "Speak up, Lonergan;</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk's cheap."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not the kind of talk I'm going to make,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">retorted Lonergan. "You know who I am,</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't you, boys?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure. He's the man who grows rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads. Spit it out, old hoss."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lonergan turned toward McKenzie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You said there'd be no work in this coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try for a man who bucked Taggart too hard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're wrong. That's just the kind of man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who'll be able to find work right here--as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as he wants--at better wages than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taggart pays. In fact, I'm up here to hire</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. Next week we're going to start blaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the trail for the line from La Croix up</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. I'll need axmen, shovelers, skinners,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drivers, spikers, cooks, water-boys, walking-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bosses--there'll be two crews. The log-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging's over for this season. How about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady job for all Spring and Summer? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boys who get on my pay-roll will be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones who help us tonight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That goes!" cried McKenzie. "I play</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Together with a few of the older men he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed forward toward Lonergan. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young fellows, the bulk of the crew, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">still. The idea of providing themselves with</seg><seg type="columnLine">further employment was farthest of all from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their minds just then. The future might</seg><seg type="columnLine">take care of itself; in the meantime, furious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtless excitement was what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">craved. This thing was too orderly, too</seg><seg type="columnLine">sober for them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To-with a job!" laughed one. "Our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">money's still good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But don't forget who saved it for you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted McKenzie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To-! We ain't playing police for no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">man's town. Come on, boys; this ain't no</seg><seg type="columnLine">fun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then go!" Gaston's voice vibrated with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">11</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">anger, though from the first he had feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">just such a turn. "And when we've won</seg><seg type="columnLine">this fight alone we'll make you fellows take</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tall timber on the run."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They laughed and started for the door;</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild colts that would not be haltered. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then they stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Has anything happened; is any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston and Hale started as one and look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed at each other at the sound of the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. It was Rose. She came running in;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the men made way for her. Inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door she paused, panting, her hands on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast, and looked around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh!" Her eyes fell on Gaston, and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite the plaster on his face, she gave an</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamation of relief. Then on Hale, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she grew quiet. "I saw the crowd; I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid some one had been hurt. But--I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistaken?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nobody hurt, Miss Rose." Dr. Sanders</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to say it jauntily, but it was a miserable</seg><seg type="columnLine">failure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hale looked steadily at the floor; Gaston</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked over her head. Neither cared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet her inquiring eyes. Nor did Lonergan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Tom, or the doctor. But the lumber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacks of Crew One were staring at her as at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vision, and the light of wickedness went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of many eyes and gave place to some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing better. They looked at her worship-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was dressed in a gown of soft white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, and her face was alight with the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a mother-heart, stirred with alarm. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">those rough boy-men she was more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely a dainty and beautiful girl. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the eternal dream woman which men</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their ilk dream of and are prepared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">worship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their caps came off unconsciously. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew sober.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rose looked at the serious faces of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">townsmen and tried in vain to catch Gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nobody hurt at all," said he airily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Just a little meeting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?" she whispered. "Is any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing going--to--happen?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no!" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dick!" she cried to Hale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no. Everything's all right. You--•</seg><seg type="columnLine">you had better go home."</seg><seg type="columnLine">i She looked around. She couldn't under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand. There was something behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces which she had learned to know so</seg><seg type="columnLine">162</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">well. She looked at Lonergan, at Tom Pine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Dr. Sanders. She turned and looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men of Crew One.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Boys!" she cried to them. "You'll tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, I know--is anything going to happen?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a moment of silence. Crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">One began to smile. Then came the reply,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellowed earnestly from a huge pair of lungs</seg><seg type="columnLine">--from the man who had said, "This ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">no fun":</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not by a da--!

"Yes, Dick; I know.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were eager to make amends, eager to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">something ferocious to prove that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant what they had said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, Husk, we didn't understand," they</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted. They held forth their hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"How the-could we understand? You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">know what kind of women we'd been seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this burg. By Godfrey!

I knew you were white</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">men if it was put up to you right." Gaston</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned over to Lonergan. "Lonergan, take</seg><seg type="columnLine">all your men who've got guns and scatter</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in a straight line across the town right</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. You've enough that nobody can slip</seg><seg type="columnLine">through without being seen. If any Tag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gart man gets through, lire a shot.

When Hale comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">back better have him and a couple others</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep moving through this end of town on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lookout.

"They're coming this way."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fine!" cried Gaston. "Boys, I prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ised you a fight. Roll up your sleeves and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spit on your hands. We've got to clean up</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gang tonight, and the way to lick a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man is to get right at him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In two great leaps he was at the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can we handle 'em?" he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us at 'em!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then come a-running!" yelled Gaston,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on the dead run he led his men out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the store, and straight at the black mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was coming up the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taggart's gang stopped suddenly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line which Gaston had drawn across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street. They stopped in surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had come on Taggart's orders, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecting to find a dozen townsmen in Hale's</seg><seg type="columnLine">store. Half a dozen carried shotguns.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their plan was to trap the men in the store,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold them helpless at gun-muzzles and fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">the town at their leisure. They had even</seg><seg type="columnLine">come prepared to shoot and shoot quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at any movement of weapons on the part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their opponents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what they found was considerably</seg><seg type="columnLine">different from what they had expected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down the street at them came hurtling a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd of yelling men as large as their own.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With Gaston at their head, with their big-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gest men at his sides, Crew One just then</seg><seg type="columnLine">was terrible to behold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston had thrown off all self-restraint.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston Olaf</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">163</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">For the time he had gone berserk, throw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing himself headlong at the enemy, think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing not and caring not that they might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed, eager only to come to grips, confi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent that nothing could stop his rush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His fury had communicated itself to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">followers. Thoughts of danger, impulses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear were for the time being non-existent</seg><seg type="columnLine">for them. Shotguns, eh? All right; a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them might go down; but they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow the big fellow through that crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">and back again, trampling the guts out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em, if they never did anything else in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gunmen hesitated. Their only chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to have shot instantly, without hesita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, as at a leaping lynx. Ere they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">think they were lost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston knocked up the first gun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the gang like a maddened bull, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men at his side. In a flash the gunmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">were down, their weapons gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fight! -you, fight!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taggart's voice rose from the rear, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of a drunken animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fight!-you, fight!" echoed Gaston</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mockingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE gang stiffened at Taggart's</seg><seg type="columnLine">command. The two sides met with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thud. Groans followed; curses and</seg><seg type="columnLine">screams drowned the sound of blows. Over</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all rose Gaston's laughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, boys -- right through 'em!</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll get Devil Dave himself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few knives flashed among the gang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sters. The glint of steel drove the lumber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacks mad. They were not to be stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a minute, possibly, Taggart's men held.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then with a shout Gaston broke through</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a dozen men; and the fight was won.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Clean 'em! Hold 'em, boys! Don't let</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em run!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crew One was just beginning to fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston and his dozen saw that Taggart had</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared, and threw themselves back on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the stuff, boys. Don't let 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">run."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the gang, suddenly feeling itself sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded, broke away. They began to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">to both sides of the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't let 'em get away!" rose the cry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They used knives. Hold 'em back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fight became a rout. The gangsters</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran in all directions. After them went the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumber-jacks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The battle spread to the timber on either</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of town. It raged steadily dow- to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the red-lights. It swept into the sa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loons and out again. Gaston led wherever</seg><seg type="columnLine">a group of the gangsters made a stand. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand he carried as a bludgeon the bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rels of a shotgun--the stock he had smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a gunman's head--and at the sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the gangsters turned and ran.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shoot him, shoot that-!" they cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But nobody found time to shoot. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rush that would not be stayed. The den-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keepers hastily locked and barred their</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors and Taggart's men found hiding-</seg><seg type="columnLine">places denied them. Down through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river-front swept the pursuit. It ended at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness along the river, and Gaston</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his men paused and drew breath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no one left for them to fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hoop-la!" The lumberjacks danced</seg><seg type="columnLine">jigs and shouted. "Bring on your tigers;</seg><seg type="columnLine">we eat 'em alive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His face alight with triumph, Gaston</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to look back. His jaw fell in horror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God, boys! Look! They've done</seg><seg type="columnLine">it after all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up the street, in the upper part of town,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sweep of flame was rushing toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. In the madness of the fight no man</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them had turned to note what was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">on behind them. Now the whole settle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment was lurid 'iinder the rapidly rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of flame, and the roar and crackle of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached even down to the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God! That must be Hale's store."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston's voice was a hoarse whisper. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it is the whole street'll go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started back toward the flames on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">run, followed by his men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not Hale's store that was burning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the building next to it. This was used</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a livery-barn, and stood wall to wall with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hale's building. The bam already was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnace, too hot to approach. From its dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">shingle roof flakes of flame were flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus far Hale's building, larger and high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er than the barn, was serving as a bulwark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shielding the rest of the settlement from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying embers. If the store went the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the barn, it would fire the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street. Olson's Hotel, with tar paper on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls, stood directly across the street from</seg><seg type="columnLine">it; Dr. Sanders's little office was at its side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From these points the flames could reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and touch the other buildings, each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, built of pine and tinder-dry, was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">164</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">kindling awaiting the match. Nothing is</seg><seg type="columnLine">as helpless as a new woods-town when a fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">starts in dry weather. Usually there is but</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing to do--move out and watch it burn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Sanders was bending over a man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crew One who lay in the street when Gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton arrived before the burning building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Big Fellow, Taggart stole a march</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you were rushing his gang," he greet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed. "He and Indian Charley sneaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around back of the barn at the height of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the melee. Had a can of oil and threw it</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the hay. This boy, here, saw 'em and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped 'em just as Taggart struck a match.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They didn't quite kill him, but the Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him a little steel between the ribs all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. The barn was one flame in two min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under Hale's direction men were carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cases of dynamite from the store to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe place in the woods. Other men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">salvaging the stock while some were climb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the roof to beat out the flames as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they fell. The heat from the burning barn</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevented any attempt at working on it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hale came out and sized up the situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"We've got to start a water line," shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed Gaston. "If we get buckets enough we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can wet your building down and save it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hale suddenly looked up at his roof. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't do it," he said. "Look."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The roof and the side wall nearest the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barn had caught. The shingles were begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning to burn, and dabs of flame began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall from them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ladders! Get some ladders!" cried Gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton. "It isn't too late yet. "We've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">men enough here to save her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A burning shingle, spewed upward by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of the flames, floated through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness above them and landed gracefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the stoop of Olson's Hotel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see? Too late," said Hale. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked long at the big, stanch building in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was a good share of all he possessed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and onde more shook his head. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't even got time to get the stock out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill," he called quietly to one of his men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"go out and bring back one case of the dy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">namite, will you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Man!" cried Gaston. "Don't do that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">yet. Let's try first-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A second flaming shingle sailed high over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street, dropped, and was stamped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the papered wall of the hotel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wouldn't have those poor women</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned out just to try to save my store,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thorson.

"Get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away out of danger. "We've got to blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">her up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A groan and a sigh of relief came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd. They regretted the destruction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the building and yet they realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">by it the town would be saved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fill up your buckets.

At the last moment they rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with armfuls of goods to join Hale, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sought shelter behind the hotel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There she goes!" groaned Tom Pine as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the building rose in the air at the explo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston vented a curse from the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his chest. The store had fallen together</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a house of cards. The barn fell with</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and there remained of it only a low pile</seg><seg type="columnLine">of jumbled lumber, which burned without</seg><seg type="columnLine">offering any danger to the other buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hale wiped his lips with his fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," he said steadily, "we did a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">job of that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A small form in white came running to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward them.

Even in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-darkness he saw the light that leapt</seg><seg type="columnLine">into them, but he looked away, as if it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something he had no right to see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Gaston!

He blew it up himself, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">there might have been a chance to save it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he was too big a man to risk others'</seg><seg type="columnLine">property to save his own."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he hurried back to where men with</seg><seg type="columnLine">buckets were splashing the fringes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXXIV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GASTON BUYS STORE CLOTHES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF ALL the wild nights that Havens</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falls had known, that was the wild-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est. For when Crew One calmed down suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficiently to count noses, it found that three</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of its members had suflered knife-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounds fully as serious as those of the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had tried to prevent Taggart from</seg><seg type="columnLine">firing the barn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Only one result could follow this discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery. The lumberjacks went on the war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">path for revenge. Nothing could stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Gaston knew the breed too well to</seg><seg type="columnLine">try. Before the fire had burned down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">embers they were back on the river front,</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-eyed with hate and fury, roaring their</seg><seg type="columnLine">intentions to revenge the boys who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been stabbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's Devil Dave? Where's that-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian?" they demanded. "We'll show 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's dangerous to knife boys from Camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">One."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Naturally, neither Taggart nor the Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be found. The jacks began hunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for other victims. These, likewise, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to find.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Most of the gang had gone into hiding.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Such as had the hardihood to remain in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloons also had the cunning to conceal the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that they had taken any share in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle. At rare intervals one of them was</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized, then there was a beating and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scurry, and only the strength of arm of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooler men prevented a lynching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Soon the river-front was cleared of every</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who might be considered a fair object</seg><seg type="columnLine">for vengeance. The tension lessened. Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to laugh and slap one another on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. The fighting was over; now to cele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brate it. Crew One rushed up to the bars</seg><seg type="columnLine">and set in to get truly good and drunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few of the older men, McKenzie lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them, held back. They even sought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">urge moderation upon the others. As well</seg><seg type="columnLine">seek to whistle down a storm. McKenzie</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his kind, seeing the uselessness of re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrance, went up to the hotel and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bed, while the victorious lumberjacks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">freed of all restraint, proceeded to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night terrible. They drank like madmen;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they howled like the bob-cats and wolves of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest, and they danced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually these effervescences ceased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The dancing and shouting ceased; the affair</seg><seg type="columnLine">degenerated into a frightful drinking con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">test. They did not move from the bars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Standing stiffly, leaning lazily, or hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">on with both hands, they stayed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rude counters, drinking as often as a glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">was set before them. Presently the weaker</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones began to fall away; the floor became</seg><seg type="columnLine">littered with them; they lay outside sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. The terrible liquor of the river-front</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid most of them low, but when daylight</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared it found a few, stiff-eyed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepy, hanging on to a bar with one hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">while with the other they carried liquor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their already burnt-out throats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the upper part of town there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace and quiet, though few slept. Gaston</seg><seg type="columnLine">organized the men in watches, and himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept circling the town all night. With the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods full of gangsters there was constant</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger that one of them would attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneak forth and start a new fire. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">even possible that Taggart might round</seg><seg type="columnLine">them up and make another rush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When daylight appeared it found Gaston</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging briskly around on the patrol which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had occupied him throughout the night. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of bitterness and defeat came to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the rising sun revealed the smoking ruins</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Hale's store and the barn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The charred timbers seemed to grin at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, reminding him that, in spite of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">overwhelming support of Crew One, Tag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gart had managed to make good a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of his threat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I broke up the gang, but I didn't get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man," mused Gaston. "Devil Dave</seg><seg type="columnLine">is still fighting, and there'll be more of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The store was a total loss. Of the large,</seg><seg type="columnLine">diversified stock which had filled it, a scant</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenth, possibly, had been saved. As Gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton contemplated what was left, he forgot</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taggart and a thrill ran through him at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory of Hale's splendid action in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crisis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's a man," he said aloud. "Yep; he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a real man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laughed swiftly as he considered how</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taggart's coup had failed, after all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">166</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Taggart set out to hurt Hale by burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">him out. He burned his store, all right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he didn't hurt him. Not much! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him a chance to show what was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. And he's such a quiet, modest little</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow you'd never suspect him of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">that big unless he had a chance like this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now he's had his chance. Everybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows what he's made of. People'll be talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of this for years to come. They'll look</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to Hale, and he deserves it. He'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the biggest men around here, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is. Ha! And Taggart gave him his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance. The laugh's on Taggart, after all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus mused Gaston as, in the first rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the-rising sun, he marched up and down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street. He had seen a fellow-man put to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the test and meet the test in glorious fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion, and he was glowing with appreciation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His own actions of the night he sincerely</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered as nothing in comparison. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had merely led in a terrific fight, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of those who begin to hear sweet music</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of the voice of fear at the approach</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trouble. He considered that he deserved</seg><seg type="columnLine">no credit. Had he been completely success-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful against Taggart he might have been in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clined to strut a little. But he had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been that, quite. The blackened timbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were reminders that Taggart was not de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And there'll be no end of this trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">till the old man himself is licked."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His march had led him to beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">post-office at this moment. He stopped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rays of the morning sun, topping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastern hills, was lighting up the front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Havens home, directly before him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston smiled. The house was very pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his eyes in the morning light. Apparent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly its occupants were sleeping soundly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of Rose as he had left her with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hale last night, and he was glad he had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and had told the truth about Hale's</seg><seg type="columnLine">store. The better man must win. It must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a fair game. If Hale was the man for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, all right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He recalled the look she had given him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her face, upturned to him, seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him. He grew thoughtful. Could he</seg><seg type="columnLine">make her happy, a woman like her? Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">he the man for her?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked down at himself and felt abash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed. His shirt was torn into strips, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through openings were to be seen cuts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bruises. He looked at his hands; his knuck-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">les were raw, and his right thumb was swol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">len and discolored. There was blood on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">red sash and buckskin trousers. No; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was scarcely the sort of specimen to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooing a girl like Rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston waited until smoke began to ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear from chimneys and the town began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stir. Then he went to the house of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">owner of the settlement's clothing store and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged him forth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello!" cried the man. "Just in time</seg><seg type="columnLine">for breakfast."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks. Don't want any breakfast,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">retorted Gaston. "Come with me to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">store. I want a new outfit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something like what you've got on, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">s'pose?" said the merchant, when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the store.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, siree, pop!" was the emphatic reply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nothing at all like what I've got on. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want--I want some regular store clothes."</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was difficulty in fitting him. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge shoulders cracked wide open the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat he tried on. At last an outfit was as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembled. He also purchased a shaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment and towels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now you'll come back and have break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast with us?" insisted the storekeeper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston excused himself. He had some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With his new clothing under his arm, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped out of town and went down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river till he found a deep, clear pool. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun was tinting the stream, and in the pool</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water was like a mirror. Kneeling on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank, Gaston leaned over and studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">his reflection in the water. He grinned at</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You certainly are hard - looking this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, boy," he chuckled, "but so long as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you didn't get your eyes blacked you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">fix yourself up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the pool as his mirror he shaved</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully. Next he stripped and stood poised</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an instant in the sunlight, a figure for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sculptor to marvel at.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Into the ice-cold water he dove with</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely a splash, and when he came leap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out to rub himself down he was rosy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He dressed himself in new apparel from feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">to head and stretched himself gingerly, feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cramped and confined at every joint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was now arrayed in a sober suit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue, a soft, white shirt with a loose collar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid leather shoes, and a soft, black hat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The coat pinched him under the arms and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubbers and moccasins being his accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston Olaf</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">167</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">footwear, the shoes felt stiff and heavy on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a sigh he tossed his old, torn shirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the current and watched it float</seg><seg type="columnLine">down-stream. The buckskin trousers, sash,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cap and rubber "high-tops" were about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow, but he checked himself. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented himself at the room which he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom had taken at the hotel, these articles</seg><seg type="columnLine">were under his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom looked up at his entrance and laugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed uproariously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What in Sam Hill, Gaston Olaf? You--</seg><seg type="columnLine">you got religion?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, no," said Gaston, tossing his old</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes into a corner, "I just wanted to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">out how town clothes feel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, how about it; how do they feeli'"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ohr" with a tug at his collar, "I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose a man can get used to anything."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXXV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A QUIET SUNDAY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A FTER the turbulent Saturday night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sunday came quiet and peaceful, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm succeeding the storm. It was the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">orderly Sunday in the history of Havens</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falls. True, a few of the celebrating lum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">berjacks upon awakening sought the bars</seg><seg type="columnLine">and attempted to resuscitate the corpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of last night's orgy, but the attempt fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Most of the men, in their own words, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">"got enough to last." Some staggered up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the hotel to sleep off the ravages of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">celebration; others sought shelter in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods for the same purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A pall hung over the river-front. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bars were nearly deserted. Where a group</seg><seg type="columnLine">was assembled there was no noise. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing new had come to the Settlement which</seg><seg type="columnLine">made itself felt even in the foulest corner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the worst den in the front--law and order,</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a vague, stupid sort of way the gang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sters realized the coming of these new forces.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That crude line, drawn by Gaston's foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the street, was like a wall unto them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They scowled and cursed, but they made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more ebullient statements that the town</seg><seg type="columnLine">was theirs, to do with as they pleased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had read the writing on the wall and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were troubled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taggart and Indian Charley had disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared immediately after firing the barn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He looked like he needed a sleep,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled Tom Pine.

But Havens Falls</seg><seg type="columnLine">was young, and recovered rapidly, and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon those same ruins were things to joke</seg><seg type="columnLine">over while wondering if the trout wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon begin biting. There were picnic parties</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on the big hill, and rowing parties up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Sanders and Hulda paddled down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream in a birch-bark canoe.

It was Hale's canoe that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddled in. Hale had no time to go canoe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that Sunday.

He found her starting up the hill</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the picnic party, and she stood stock</seg><seg type="columnLine">still and marveled at the change in his at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," he laughed, "do I look civilized?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," she said seriously, and paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even if I don't act that way, yet?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. I wasn't going to say that," was</seg><seg type="columnLine">her grave reply.

But men say it was fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and big--your fighting; that you are a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great man.

Below</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the town and its environs lay like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">green map. There lay the Settlement on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat in the river bend, a peerless town-site.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through it curved the rushing La Croix,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lending virility and force to the scene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On all hands stretched the fat farming</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, waiting only the plow of the breaker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The birch gleamed white through the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">note of Spring.

"Isn't it</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to make a man want to throw off</seg><seg type="columnLine">his coat and dig in to help make it fit for</seg><seg type="columnLine">folks to live in? Look at that flat along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river--miles and miles of it! Think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what a lot of young couples can find homes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and farms on that! Look at the power in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that river! Can't you see mills and wood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">factories along it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And there's the little town.

It's a dream, I know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but this dream certainly is coming true."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She cried out, clapping her hands in de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light at the picture he had drawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Gaston! To think there's all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned swiftly, a hungry look at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners of his mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rose--Rose, there's many sorts of things</seg><seg type="columnLine">in me.

She grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm, drawing him around so he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet her eyes. "How can you ask me that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you've done what you have for me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, no! Not that. You know what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly she let go of his arm, and slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes went to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Gaston, Gaston!" she stammered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You charm me, you thrill me.

"But--have I got a chance?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She did not reply. Her eyes rose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">met his and fell again. And he knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could win her; that if he persisted she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come to love him; that he could make</seg><seg type="columnLine">her his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXXVI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SETTLING DOWN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FROM that moment he gravely set to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work to make himself fit to have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right to claim her. He realized that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a difficult task before him. There was Hale,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston Olaf</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and Hale was in love with her, and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make her the kind of husband she deserved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She would marry Hale, Gaston knew, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were not for himself. And she would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy with Hale, too. So he had no right</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think of winning her unless he could make</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that he would be as good a husband as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hale. That was his task now: to be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of a man who was fit to marry Rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">Havens. It would be a hard pull; but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done many hard things, and his confi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence in himself was unbounded. So he set</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His first move was to call on Jack Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carthy in the latter's place that evening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had selected McCarthy as the strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of the river-front. McCarthy greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him quietly and thrust forth a bottle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">two glasses. Gaston pushed them back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll have a little water, Jack."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without a word McCarthy filled two</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses with water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's how?" said he. "Now--shoot."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"For a start," began Gaston, "you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've got no hard feelings against you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're in this business, and that's all right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I've been elected to keep order in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">town, and that's my business. You're the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader down here, and that's why I'm talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to you. The wild days are over in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">town. Pin that up over your register and</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember it. This gang down here doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">run Havens Falls any longer. We've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whip-hand up in the other end of town,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we've decided to make the place de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent. We aren't going to interfere with you</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless you interfere with us. There's a line</seg><seg type="columnLine">up there in the street. You fellows keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">this side of it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Don't think I'm just talking. It's seri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous. You fellows might tear loose and lick</seg><seg type="columnLine">us once. But we're here to stay. You can</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass the word to the gang that their day's</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. This is your side of the line; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't let things get so wild that they spill</seg><seg type="columnLine">over on us. If you do, somebody will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave town--and we're high man. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling you this to avoid trouble."</seg><seg type="columnLine">McCarthy nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I've seen it coming," he said. "I'm get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting ready to move."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later that night Gaston took Red-Shirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murphy a mile down the river road and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed down-stream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good-by, Murphy," he said. "You've</seg><seg type="columnLine">had your day in Havens Falls, but you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving now. Don't come back. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be healthy. Lynching's too good</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a man who'll rob a kid; here's what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserve-- Hike!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Red Shirt's teeth rattled as Gaston's right</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot lifted him in the air. The erstwhile</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad man picked himself up hurriedly. Gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton was setting himself for another kick;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murphy put his head down and ran, out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight, and out of Havens Falls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next, Gaston placed the deeds for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own and Tom Pine's timber claim in Loner-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan's hands. The railroad man added the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land to the holdings of his company. A few</seg><seg type="columnLine">days later he returned from La Croix with</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeds conveying to the two partners the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parcel of land which he had directed Gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton to secure in Havens Falls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now I feel sure of you," said Lonergan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the last details of the transfer were</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed. "You'll stick now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I say you'll stick here now. Was afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd quit us and go wandering. Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want you to do it. We need you right here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Feel sure of you now; a man usually sticks</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the spot where he's got property."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom Pine grumbled as he studied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Town property," he growled. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">have I got to do with things like that? A</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of timber-land, that's all right. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">man can build his shack and camp on it if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wants to. But I ain't no town real-es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tater, Gaston Olaf, you know that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can sell out pretty soon and get</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to buy all the timber-land you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want," replied Gaston. "This is our chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make a stake."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Tom thought it over for a while.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yep; that's all right for you, Gaston</seg><seg type="columnLine">Olaf--to make a stake," he muttered. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me, after it's made, what am I going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do with it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nevertheless Tom Pine followed his lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er's example, and, apparently, was resolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon settling down and becoming a perma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent resident of Havens Falls. He went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work for Hale, who, backed by Lonergan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rebuilding the store. Tom worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily through the lazy Spring days and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew only such part of his pay as was neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary for his expenses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"If I had any loose money in my clothes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd be apt to want to let 'er roar a little,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he explained, "and Gaston Olaf being mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shal, 'twouldn't be right of me to do that."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston, finding no immediate call for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">170</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">services as marshal, went to work on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad. Lonergan had started his line</seg><seg type="columnLine">from both ends, and Gaston was placed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge of the clearing crew working out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Havens Falls. He was a very different fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man than the one who had driven Tag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gart's men so ruthlessly. He worked so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">berly and steadily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The line ran out through a forest of birch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At times, when the white trunks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees glistened in the warm Spring sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the rapidly growing leaves waved laz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily in the slight breeze, and a dozen varieties</seg><seg type="columnLine">of birds made the woods alive with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">songs and plumage, he was moved to leap</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air and shout from sheer joy of liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. He didn't do it, however. At such</seg><seg type="columnLine">times he thought of what he was working</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, and with tightly pressed lips seriously</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on with his duties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was only one thing to worry him</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. Taggart had sobered up and had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to his office, as cold and masterful</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently as ever. It was his busy sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. His drives were behind the booms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was occupied with the work of turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the Winter's harvest into money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston agreed with his associates not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble Taggart so long as he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble them. He did not for an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancy that Taggart had dropped the feud.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He kept his skin whole in those days only</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his unflagging vigilance, and by showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taggart and his men that he was not to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught off his guard. The strain brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">new fines about his mouth. What new dev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iltry was Taggart planning? When would</seg><seg type="columnLine">he show it, and how?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston's natural impulse was to rush to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet Taggart face to face and have it over</seg><seg type="columnLine">with, one way or another, in one final clash.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He held his peace, however, a trying thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him to do with an enemy in sight. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural impulses were under complete con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol--for the time being.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXXVII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A STORM BREWING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TAGGART'S old gang had been thor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oughly broken up. A few of its mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers, who had taken only a small part in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">memorable night fight, came drifting back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully feeling out the ground and ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to flee at the first sign of hostility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The fight had been taken out of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Craven at heart, they saw that power in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">settlement had passed from Taggart to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">decent element, and they sought at once to</seg><seg type="columnLine">curry favor with the latter. Here, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they met rebuffs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston pointed to the line he had drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You made your choice that night," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminded them.

We need it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Things have been mighty dull."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the next few days it developed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lonergan's man had reported the situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">correctly. One by one the old saloon-keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers of the front sold out, and men of Ul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nick's type took their places. The dives</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the dance-hall changed hands last of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. There was a complete change in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">personnel of the front. The newcomers</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought women with them. The river-front</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in their hands and under Ulnick's lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ership.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Save for this threatening change, Havens</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falls would have been gloriously content</seg><seg type="columnLine">with itself during those bright days of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spring. It was experiencing the first thrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a boom, and the optimism of a boom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">town was its to a considerable degree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That a railroad was being built up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">settlement was in itself enough to start the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthusiasm. Settlers began to come in;</seg><seg type="columnLine">merchants followed them. The rattle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammers echoed ceaselessly throughout the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm days. Houses were thrown up swift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. Lots were staked out and sold, build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing lots, where a few weeks before rabbits</seg><seg type="columnLine">had romped undisturbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Plans were made to apply for a city char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, to build a school and a church. Hale's</seg><seg type="columnLine">new stock came in by the wagon-load. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">it not been for the new crowd in the river-</seg><seg type="columnLine">front the settlement would have whooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with joy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The river-front grew more threatening</seg><seg type="columnLine">day by day. Taggart was discharging all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his old men and replacing them with for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eigners. These men grew more and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">insolent toward the townspeople.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then one day it became known that Tag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gart had started drinking again. Nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">was surprised. Having by choice surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed himself with a swinish crew, he proceeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sink himself to their level. Gaston knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the inevitable clash would come before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taggart was over this spree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Inevitable, hm, hm, inevitable that he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">do that," commented Dr. Sanders. "In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stincts all wrong, you know. Whisky and</seg><seg type="columnLine">women; he can't rise above them. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">whisky has been getting him, too, this last</seg><seg type="columnLine">year. His debauches have been a little, hm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hm,' a little too inhuman even for him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand. Nerves torn to pieces; system cry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing periodically for excesses, each one worse</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the last. He'll go to pieces; had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">willies a couple times. Go to pieces sure;</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely to do damage when he does."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One quiet evening the doctor, visiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hulda at the hotel, was sent for to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to one of the dives. His patient was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unfortunate woman; her thin, miserable</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm had been broken above the elbow by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow. In a corner of the room sat Taggart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding a broken whisky bottle by the neck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leering insanely, his eyes popping, his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerking about helplessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fix her up, Doc; want to teach her</seg><seg type="columnLine">'nother lesson," he sneered. "Teach 'em all</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessons.

"Another man'll die of it;</seg><seg type="columnLine">not me. His name's Thorson. I'll show</seg><seg type="columnLine">'im. He's the one who's good as dead."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston tightened his lips as Dr. Sanders</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him of this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It'll come now; he'll run wild, like a mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog," said he. "Well, the sooner the better."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom Pine likewise grew serious as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the doctor repeat Taggart's words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That means the old devil's set a trap for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Gaston Olaf."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And he's got them Hunyaks with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time--too many of 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a long silence. Dr. Sanders</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroked his beard nervously; Gaston sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at the ground. At last Tom Pine</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose casually, clearing his throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Guess I'll go for a little walk before</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning in," he said, striving to speak care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly, but his effort betrayed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've walked enough today," said Gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, catching him by the arm. "Sit down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't you go starting a little war against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taggart by yourself. I've told you that</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't go any more here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the easiest way, Gaston Olaf," pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested Tom.

He had found content-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, even happiness. Gaston began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream. His quick imagination pictured</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in the doctor's place. He saw Rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving about him--about their home--</seg><seg type="columnLine">tripping lightly on her tiny feet, her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">alight with joy. Was there anything better</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the world than that?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whip - er - will; whip-er-will; whip - er-</seg><seg type="columnLine">will!" suddenly cried a whippoorwill down</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Startled, Gaston looked in its direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw the river-front, red with lights,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a sudden shout of drunken song, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brow clouded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better have that settled before you be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gin planning," he told himself. "You may</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be here to plan after that's over."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To rid himself of these dark thoughts he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose and walked up to where Dr. Sanders</seg><seg type="columnLine">was building his new home. To his surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw that the house was less than half</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished. It would be impossible at the rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was going to have it completed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day set for the wedding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh! That isn't right," he mused.</seg><seg type="columnLine">174</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"The doc and Hulda ought to have their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own house ready to move into!" A gleam</seg><seg type="columnLine">of amusement crossed his face. The dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts were forgotten. "Yes, by Jupi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter! and they're going to have it, too," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said and went home to bed smiling boyishly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next morning he broached his idea to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We owe it to the doc," he explained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's a good fellow. We'll give 'em a build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-bee and have the house all ready for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hale promptly fell in with the idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The store can wait," he said, and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself and his builders over to the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">project.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston explained to Lonergan why he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would leave the crew for a week.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," said Lonergan. "Need any more</seg><seg type="columnLine">men?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Sanders rubbed his eyes when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came forth to inspect the progress of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hm, hm! What's this, what's this?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston, in the act of lifting a rafter into</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, laughed down at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tom Pine and I want your old shack,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "so we've decided to get this one</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished for you in a hurry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hm, hm. All right," said the doctor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do the same for you some time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The finishing of the doctor's house be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a lark for the whole settlement. Other</seg><seg type="columnLine">building stopped for the time being while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the builders devoted themselves to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building-"bee." From the rapidly growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure rose a constant rat-tat-tat of ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mers, punctuated by the jests and laughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crowd of workers. As they worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">they considered the situation seriously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The doc was fig'ring on a quiet wedding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that won't do," said one enthusiast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now that we've started on it we might's</seg><seg type="columnLine">well do it up brown. Let's make it a holi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, and everybody lay off and give 'em a</seg><seg type="columnLine">send-off that'll do the town proud."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The idea was greeted with acclamation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the first wedding of importance in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the settlement, and the pioneers determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make it a memorable event. The work</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the house went on with increased speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two days before the day set for the wed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ding Gaston climbed to the peak of the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fastened a small flag, donated by Post-</seg><seg type="columnLine">master Perkins, to the tin chimney. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd gathered before the house, compris-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing every man, woman and child of the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectable portion of Havens Falls, waved</seg><seg type="columnLine">hats and handkerchiefs and cheered lustily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The house was finished and ready for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor and Hulda to occupy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Gaston came clambering down from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof he met Rose leading a corps of wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men into the building. Some carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">brooms, others carried curtains, plants, car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pet pieces and other articles of furniture and</seg><seg type="columnLine">decoration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your job is done here, Mr. Man," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said gaily. "Now the ladies come on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene to beautify the labor of men's hands."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's what they always do," he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied. "Men can't do anything but put up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bare walls; it's you women who make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">home out of a place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course. But a woman can't make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">home unless there's a man to do the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. You see, we're dependent on each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. And each has got to be depend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able." He looked the house over. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor and Hulda will be happy here, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right; they're both the dependable kind."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rose laughed, a trifle mischievously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Certainly they'll be happy. Hulda's</seg><seg type="columnLine">started mothering him already, and the doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor is the kind of man who needs and likes</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be mothered. Oh, yes; they'll be happy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hulda'll be the boss in a month; and Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sanders knows it and is glad of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston gazed at her, wide-eyed with ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's so. I can see it, now that you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken of it. How did you know it? Can</seg><seg type="columnLine">you read all men like that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No." She grew serious. "No, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">men a woman can't read at all. It's all</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain in the doctor's case; he--he's just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nice, ordinary man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some men aren't--nice and ordinary?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Aren't ordinary," she corrected. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">--oh, I don't know. Gaston," she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking straight at him, "I wonder if I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever know you. You're so full of surprises.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One day I think of you as fierce--no, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">that--as restless and reckless. Sort of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild, strange spirit. And then you do</seg><seg type="columnLine">something sweet and pretty, like getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">this house finished, so they'll have their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">home to move into when they're married.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What a jolly idea that was!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I like to see folks have homes," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. I know you do."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston Olaf</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">175</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want a home of.jny own," he whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered hoarsely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked at him tenderly for a moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Gaston," she said softly, "are you sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you do? Are you sure that you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">that more than--your freedom? For you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know--you know you can not have them</seg><seg type="columnLine">both."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am sure--" he began, but checked</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. He hesitated, his eyes on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. "If I was sure, Rose-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you're not, Gaston!" she whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">haltingly. "You're not! I can see it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're not sure yet; you know you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within him he felt an all but uncontrol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lable impulse to reply firmly that, yes, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sure. The impulse sprang from the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">roots of his being. It cried out to him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">swear that he was sure, to dominate her, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make her believe it was so, to take her for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His lips even opened to utter the words.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He trembled, and for an instant his blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were clouded with the agony of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle. The selfishness of the young male</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose strong in him. He wanted her so much,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, whispered impulse, it would be so easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to convince her that he was sure; it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">even be easy to convince himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His lips were parted; the words came</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing to his tongue; and then he clicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jaws together and threw up his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes were clear again now, and some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing finer than yearning, something finer</seg><seg type="columnLine">even than the light of love itself, was gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the deep blue of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rose--" his voice was normal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady again--"I don't know whether I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She nodded gravely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew you weren't sure, Gaston. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could feel it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When I am sure, do you think you could</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel that, too?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again she nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If ever you are sure, I think I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel that, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'If'? Then you don't think-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned away without reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I do come to know that I'm sure," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">persisted, "and you feel it, what then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned back and looked at him for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Gaston," she said, "I like you, and I like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick Hale. But you are trying to make me</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than like you. Oh, Gaston! You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mustn't talk to me like this unless you be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come sure of yourself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Forgive me," he whispered penitently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll never speak another word of it--unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm sure I have the right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She held out her hand impulsively.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Shake!" she said, smiling. "Now I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">get to work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As she turned to join the other women,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hale came up, his arms filled with rolls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall-paper. Rose eagerly tore open a roll</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look at the pattern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Dick!" she cried. "What perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">taste you've got! Such a dainty blue, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">those tiny flowers! Won't it make their sit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting-room perfectly darling!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went inside, Rose fairly skipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">with eagerness while Hale smiled patiently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston, looking after them, smiled also; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he only did so because it was natural for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to smile when he was hit hard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, Thorson," called a man from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the house, and Gaston roused him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. "Where are we going to build the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance floor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was another idea which the settle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment had conceived to aid in celebrating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wedding. They were going to have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance, of course. What would a wedding</seg><seg type="columnLine">be without a dance? An orchestra was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be brought up from La Croix, not merely a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of fiddlers, but a real orchestra, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluding horns and a trap-drummer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would be a celebration to attract</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a crowd as never yet had been known</seg><seg type="columnLine">north of La Croix. Would there be room</seg><seg type="columnLine">for everybody to dance in the doctor's new</seg><seg type="columnLine">house? Obviously there would not be.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus it was resolved to splurge and lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">down an outdoor dancing-floor which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">send the fame of Havens Falls flying broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast throughout the woods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men turned from the building of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house to the laying of the floor. While some</seg><seg type="columnLine">put down the boards others went into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamp and cut a wagon-load of small ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">green trees. These were fastened upright</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the floor, enclosing it in four odor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous green walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To further embellish the scene, Postmas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter Perkins brought forth a roll of old bunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. The boys cheered. It reminded them</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Fourth of July.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the night before the wedding it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all complete. The house was ready for oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupancy; the orchestra was in town; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor was in shape. Hale had gone to La</seg><seg type="columnLine">176</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Croix to drive the minister up in the morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and it awaited only the morning for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the celebration to begin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said Gaston, as he and Tom Pine</seg><seg type="columnLine">quit work that evening, "I'm surprised they</seg><seg type="columnLine">let us get that done without a hitch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom whistled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean those Hunyaks and Taggart?</seg><seg type="columnLine">You been thinking about them, tod?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I couldn't hardly forget them, could I?</seg><seg type="columnLine">They've been noisy enough every night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They've left us strictly alone, though, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that looks bad. Taggart must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding 'em in, though he's plumb crazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">from drinking. If he has, it's only been for</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tomorrow, you mean, Gaston Olaf?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, it would be like the old devil to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save his worst stroke for a day like tomor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom Pine grew thoughtful. He retired</seg><seg type="columnLine">early to his room. From the window of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room he could look down the river-front</seg><seg type="columnLine">from end to end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom carefully oiled his rifle and Gaston's,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried levers and triggers, loaded the maga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zines to the brim, and went to bed. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning he complained of excruciating pains</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his left leg, alleging that he had strained</seg><seg type="columnLine">it the day before. Besides, his rheumatism</seg><seg type="columnLine">always bothered him that time of the year,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. It would be necessary, he declared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him to keep to his bed most of the day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lest the trouble become aggravated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston laughed, knowing well Tom's dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like for conventional festivities and recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nizing a subterfuge. But Tom had moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bed so he could lie on it and look out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window upon the river-front.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXXIX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TAGGART STRIKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE day of the wedding dawned clear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool and sunny. A slight breeze, blow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the woods toward the river, car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried over the town the many fresh odors of</seg><seg type="columnLine">northern woods in the full bloom of early</seg><seg type="columnLine">Summer. There was the odor of balsam in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air, and of budding tamaracks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spruce.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up from the swamp came the smell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowslips and yellow - headed water - lilies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while from the sunny sides of the surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hills there came drifting down the gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle odor of dying woods violets, which in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">spots covered the ground like a carpet. Up</seg><seg type="columnLine">above, against the sky, tiny specks of white</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds shared with a pair of lazily soaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">hawks in the vast blue dome of the heav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ens. The birds of the forest, with no clat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of hammering to alarm them, drew near,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the stillness of the morning their</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear notes ringed the settlement around</seg><seg type="columnLine">with song. It was a day when the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">world seemed glad and filled with young life</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a day fit for the wedding of a Hulda.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The people of the settlement, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitors, appeared early, dressed for the oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casion. Postmaster Perkins was solemnly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorgeous in ancient swallow-tailed coat, high</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather boots, hickory shirt and wide-brim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">med G. A. R. hat. Lonergan even went</seg><seg type="columnLine">further--he wore a new suit of black, a stiff</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt and collar!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From these extremes of fashion the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parel of the men ranged to the fringed buck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin shirts and trousers of the trappers who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come in from the woods for the occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. Most of the women and girls man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged to display something new in the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dress, sash or ribbon. Some of the girls</seg><seg type="columnLine">were spick-and-span in white dresses with</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide blue sashes. A few Indians waddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolidly about in blankets and moccasins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wedding was set for "high noon," as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the editor at La Croix wrote in his next</seg><seg type="columnLine">week's issue. After the ceremony, dinner</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be served, and then the dancing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to begin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the private recesses of Olson's Hotel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rose and other women had Hulda prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the event an hour before the time set.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was with difficulty that Hulda was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained from doing her share of the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the hotel that morning. Only after</seg><seg type="columnLine">she saw that neighbors were efficiently as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisting her mother, did she agree to "sit like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a loafer," as she expressed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When fully dressed for her wedding Hul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">da's appearance threw her attendants into</seg><seg type="columnLine">ecstasies of delight. Of all the women pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent she was the only one serene and undis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbed.

They threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves onto the buggy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was only a matter of seconds.

"He's gone!" groaned Lonergan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston was passing McCarthy's old place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the doorway appeared the bull-necked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ulnick, shot-gun in hand.

He had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar in his mouth; his face was devilish with</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumph as he raised the gun toward his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. And the next instant he lay face</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward on his own door-step, shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the temples, dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom Pine had not remained in his room</seg><seg type="columnLine">in vain. He had not been able to save the</seg><seg type="columnLine">minister: that had come too quickly, too</seg><seg type="columnLine">unforeseen. But he had witnessed the as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sault on the buggy, had seen the minister</seg><seg type="columnLine">borne away, and he knew what would fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. He had seen Gaston go flying down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street, and his rifle was cocked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready, covering the river-front as a deer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunter covers the range before him when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the game is about to jump.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ulnick's was the first menacing figure to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show in any doorway, and Tom Pine threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on him and fired with the sure, easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">aim of the old-timer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before Ulnick's body had struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, Tom had jacked in a new cartridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fired again. A man with a revolver had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust his head out of the dance-hall, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom's bullet passed through his jaw and</seg><seg type="columnLine">splintered a window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then crack, crack, crack! The river-front</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly had a bath of lead. Into every</seg><seg type="columnLine">door Tom sent his bullets, the shots coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">so rapidly that it seemed that several men</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be firing. Glass flew in splinters. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">third man, sticking his head out of a door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was down on the floor, a bullet-hole through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cheek. The screams of the two wound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed men supplemented the rattle of shots</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the crash of glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the dance-hall a revolver cracked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bullet flew past Gaston's head. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him Erik grunted in surprised fashion</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sank down with his hands held to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom riddled the dance - hall in reply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shrieks and curses came forth, but no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The river - front was a pandemonium.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Women began to leave their dives and run</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the woods.

After a few min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes he came out, crossed the street and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered another saloon, still bearing the paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not a sound came up to the watchers. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">he emerged from the second place a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">came timidly out of the dance-hall and call-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to the messenger in Polish. The old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man spoke rapidly, handing the man the</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice. The man tossed it into the dance-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall and without a word, ran for the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">road. From Ulnick's some one shouted at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man. He held up his hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back to the doctor's office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They say, can they go and you no shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em, hah?" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sigh of relief escaped Gaston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he said. "Tell them no one will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be hurt before a quarter-past twelve."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hold on!" cried Erik's friends. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't go with us. These guys may all duck</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. We won't stand by and see that; we</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to play a little with the fellow who</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot Erik."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You bet! None of that letting 'em go.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let's go down and make 'em give him up</seg><seg type="columnLine">right now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston held up his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Boys, I promise you you'll get the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who shot Erik."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's in that dance-hall," they protest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed. "He'll get away with the rest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's in that dance-hall," agreed Gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, "but he won't get away with the rest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I promise you that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you see him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I saw him. And if he comes out, I promise</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, I'll be the first to go down and get him."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right, Thorson. But that's got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It'll be good," said Gaston, and sent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">messenger on his way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a short lull after the old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had delivered his message. Then the exo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dus began. Like rats, the denizens of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">places of vice came slinking out in the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. They hugged the walls, casting fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful looks over their shoulders. They saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ulnick's body lying on the saloon floor, saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broken windows, splintered doors, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet-marks, and they ran.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two wounded men called pleadingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for assistance, but no one heard. Five min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes before the time-limit had elapsed, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last woman to leave the dives had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the river-front and was following the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, straggling line hurrying down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river road, the last of the forces of vileness</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave Havens Falls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the man who shot Erik wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">among 'em," said Gaston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You sure?" Erik's friends were suspi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious. "You ain't trying to play with us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thorson?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure not, boys; he's still in the dance-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll go and see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will," agreed Gaston icily, "when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's twelve-fifteen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By sheer force of will he held them. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidgeted angrily, like dogs in the leash with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their quarry before them. The minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged painfully. Two minutes remained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then one minute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on," said a youngster, "that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">close 'nough."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston held him back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently Lonergan snapped his watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut and nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come along, boys," said Gaston quietly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They followed down the street in uncan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ny silence, crowding closely about him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he led the way to the dance-hall. The door</seg><seg type="columnLine">was open and they could see inside. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">first saw the man whom Tom Pine had shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the jaw. He was sitting on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, leaning drunkenly against the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they saw the other man. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lolling in a chair against the bar, grinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ghastly fashion at the poor fellow on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. His eyes were popping from his head;</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jaw sagged weakly; his tongue hung out;</seg><seg type="columnLine">his long arms drooped down nervelessly. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet a big revolver lay where it had drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped from his fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was what was left of Devil Dave Taggart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE crowd halted at the doorway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aghast at the demoniacal transfor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mation before them. Gaston enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed alone. Taggart neither saw nor heard;</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attention was all for the man on the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston Olaf</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">181</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Taggart!" shouted Gaston, putting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand on his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taggart looked up slowly, no gleam of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligence in his blood-shot eyes. In spite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his enmity for the man, Gaston felt a</seg><seg type="columnLine">twinge of pity. He picked up the revolver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Taggart! Get up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With his left arm he raised him to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. Taggart waved a hand at the wound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed man and laughed slobberingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Funny face," he whispered. "Look at's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come along," said Gaston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the revolver in his right hand he</seg><seg type="columnLine">led the way out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Boys," he said coldly, "you can't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">him--not now. If he'd put up a fight it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been different. Now I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take him down to his office and lock him</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. Out of the way!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went straight through them; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood back and let him pass without a word.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then they followed as Gaston led his pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oner toward the office on the river bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taggart went along in a stupor at first.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not recognize Gaston, did not sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was happening. As they approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, however, his eyes seemed to clear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the sight of his own office he stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, Taggart," said Gaston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taggart looked around wildly. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river a few steps away, saw the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind them, and lastly he saw Gaston. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">if in a flash of lightning he understood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a cry like a wounded animal he tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose. He stood up straight and stiff, him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self for an instant, his eyes upon the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had tom his evil hold from Havens</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thorson, you -!" he screamed, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dove forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His arms caught Gaston and held him</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless. The strength of a maniac was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taggart's for that moment. Down in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sawdust they fell, tightly clinched. Twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">they rolled over and over. Taggart's mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh rang loud to the heavens; and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">they rolled over again and, still locked to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, dropped into the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The water was deep and still where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell in. The current closed over them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept on its way again, serene, undisturbed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the crowd lined the bank, silent, help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less. The seconds seemed hours. Many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them passed, and still the swift, black</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters rushed on unbroken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men panted open-mouthed. They groan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed in agony as air-bubbles broke the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. And then they shouted once, sharp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. Gaston came popping out of the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a cork, gasped hungrily at the air, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came swimming weakly back to shore--</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few more bubbles appeared farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">down-stream. Then the black water once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more was slipping on its way, calm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful as ever, with no hint on its sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the thing that was hidden in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston stood dripping and panting on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river bank. He looked at the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which he had so narrowly escaped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he turned and went up the street with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     "MEN, men!" said the minister,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rftSn when released from the hotel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"what have you done? You bade</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to come among you to join two of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">young people in a new life, and you make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day one of strife and bloodshed."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Postmaster Perkins bared his silvery head</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh</seg><seg type="columnLine">away; blessed be the name of the Lord!' "</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose his aged treble. "Reverend, what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">done had to be done. There was a jam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she had to be broke so decent people</seg><seg type="columnLine">could live here, and fellows like you could</seg><seg type="columnLine">come through the white water and bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">light into the wilderness. The Lord took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bad people away. He giveth us young</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, like Ilulda Olson and Doc Sanders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to marry and have children, and people the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land. The old order changeth, Reverend;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wickedness has gone from Havens Falls</seg><seg type="columnLine">for good. The new order cometh, and it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of hope and promise; and the Lord looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon His work and finds it good. Reverend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we ain't in no mood to hold the celebration</seg><seg type="columnLine">we planned, but in this dark moment we</seg><seg type="columnLine">need that wedding to help us look toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the future."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Hulda, firmly.

The tragic manner of its coming had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left its mark; Havens Falls was not likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to forget what the river-front had meant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it; it would never again run the risk of simi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar conditions. Before the traces of the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruel struggle had been removed a solemn</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass-meeting was held before Olson's hotel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was whisky that did it, boys--whisky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wickedness, and hell-raising," quavered</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Perkins. "Touch and go, it. was, boys;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we happened to win because a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to town who was big enough to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">us strong. We were a helpless little hell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole here in the woods before he came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">town. Now we're clean, thank God! As</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean as the timber around us. Boys, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">we going to risk getting in another gang like</seg><seg type="columnLine">what we had? Are we going to have an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other river-front? Or are we going to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a decent town that will grow and be a cred-</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to the men who made it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A decent town--that's the ticket!" came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the responses. "We've had enough of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other thing. What do you say, Thorson?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston looked down toward the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">front. For the time being he was as seri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous-minded as any man in the crowd. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw not the glitter and excitement of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front, but only its sordid vileness, its men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ace to a community of homes, of families, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">women and children.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I say," he began slowly, and paused as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vision grew before his eyes, "I say we</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to burn the river-front to the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scatter the ashes, and build new build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings where it stands, so there'd be nothing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">left to remind us of what was there or what</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened before it was cleaned up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They voted on it, a vote of hands, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the wild youngsters working for Loner-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan voted, "ay."

Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw down their tools and demanded their</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Lonergan even suggested a lay-off for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a week.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not for a day," said Gaston stubbornly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was beginning to hear the whisperings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of doubt within himself. The clear lakes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rivers, the untracked woods had begun</seg><seg type="columnLine">to call. The lure of strange trails and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventures new had whispered to his restless</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He put temptation away savagely. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single day would he yield in the program</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had mapped out for himself. For it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the moments of idleness that the call</seg><seg type="columnLine">made itself heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're getting kind of peekid-looking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston Olaf," warned Tom Pine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know it," admitted Gaston. His shav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-mirror had shown him the new lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering between the eyebrows and about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The quiet, lazy Sundays came to be long</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tiresome. He seldom sought Rose's</seg><seg type="columnLine">company since their conversation at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house-building, and save for thoughts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, he admitted to himself, town-life was</seg><seg type="columnLine">irksome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hale, likewise, spent less time at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Havens home than previously. He was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">given to intruding himself where he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that he was wanted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The settlement developed rapidly. Tag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gart's property had fallen into the hands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a far-away niece, and the lumber company,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which she sold, promptly put the cut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over land on the market, induced settlers</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come in, and began to assist in all ways</seg><seg type="columnLine">to build up the country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When the railroad gets through, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">country will crowd up right away," mused</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston, as he read the signs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reproved himself promptly for such</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts. Was it not for this that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked and risked his life?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The heat of the Summer passed, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for the first frosts drew near. Instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ring of the axes of the clearing-crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">there now rang out along the right-of-way</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clang of spiking hammers fastening the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel rails to the new-laid ties. Instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">teams bearing loads of ties, a small locomo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive came tooting slowly toward Havens</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falls, pushing before it flat-car loads of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rails that the crews were laying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Day by day the twin lines of steel crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">northward toward the settlement, and day</seg><seg type="columnLine">by day, as he led his crew, Gaston sensed</seg><seg type="columnLine">how completely the humdrum of civiliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion would conquer the country when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad began operations. The toot of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">locomotive in the timber was a warning. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">knelled the passing of adventure in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the Big Woods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet Gaston worked steadily. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain thrill in the building of the rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road, and he did not permit himself to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the days to come after the road was fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first frosts came, touching the birch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and maple with a gentle wand, and tinting</seg><seg type="columnLine">their leaves dainty pink and yellow. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">air was like rare wine, and the woods were</seg><seg type="columnLine">184</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">clamorous with the chatter of birds congre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gating for the long flight southward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the morning, while trudging to work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston paused and with his eyes followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flight of migrating ducks across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trackless sky. He watched them until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were out of sight, and he wondered what</seg><seg type="columnLine">new scenes they would view before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought rest at nightfall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whistle of the locomotive now could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be heard in the settlement. Lonergan had</seg><seg type="columnLine">added more men to the crews, and the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being pushed so the road would be com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted before the frost settled into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. Gaston did his work steadily and</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, but there was a lack of buoyancy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthusiasm in him. He now looked for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward to the end of the work with a feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of discomfort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woods were a riot of color now. Au-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumn was in the Northland, and the gods</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the glorious Indian Summer had painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world with a lavish brush. Deep pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple and burnt umber, blood-red and faint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est yellow ocher, rioted together on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landscape; and over the hills, like a deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate veil, hung the Indian Summer's faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue haze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With less than a week's work remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the railroad, there came to the settle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment a rumor of a silver strike in the rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrens far to the north, across the line.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daring, adventurous men were flocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">thither, said rumor, to pit their strength and</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck against the cruel northern Winter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crueler men. The men working on the rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road leaned on their tools and wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it would be like up there. Gaston</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard them and grimly ordered them back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their tasks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night, however, he paced up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down along the river until far into the morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and his palms were raw from the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of his finger nails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XLII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"the trail, the trail!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">npHF. railroad was finished. The twin</seg><seg type="columnLine">■*- streaks of steel had reached Havens</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falls, binding it closely to the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great civilized world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The finish came at the end of a hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">day's work. Remained only the ceremony</seg><seg type="columnLine">of driving the last spike, which was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">performed with due rites and celebration in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning, and the first train, bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">mails, freight and passengers would come</seg><seg type="columnLine">tooting its way into the settlement. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">big job was done, and Havens Falls was full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gaiety that night, anxious to make of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow a big gala-day in its history.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston was not gay. He was the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of the crew to leave the line. He left</seg><seg type="columnLine">reluctantly. The job was done. Havens</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falls was no longer a stray, woods-settle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, but a new growing town on a rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the old settlement he had had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. He had played his part well. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">what place did he have in this town, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">people were talking of flour-mills and po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tato-warehouses, and dreaming of paved</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets and electric-lights?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was the question that had troubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">him for the last weeks. As the signs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town's development increased, so had in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased Gaston's sense of strangeness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">confinement. He felt cooped up, cramped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and out of place. He had tried to deny it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but now he was forced to acknowledge to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. He did not belong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stores and sidewalks, plate-glass win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows, regular hours, electric-lights! What</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he to do with them? He had come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Havens Falls and had found a part waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him to play. But now his part had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been played; never again would the settle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment have need of one of his kind; his job</seg><seg type="columnLine">was done; he was through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With something like a sigh Gaston turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back on the line and came through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool, early darkness into Havens Falls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The town was full of people, on hand for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great event of the morrow. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel there was no talk save of the railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">and what it would do for the country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the midst of this liveliness Gaston was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a stranger at a feast. He retired to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor's old office and without a word Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pine and he sat down on their door-stcp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each busy with the same thought. Up</seg><seg type="columnLine">above, the white northern stars began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam through the darkness. And in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lull the cry of a lone wolf on some far-away</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill-top came floating into the town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder," said Tom Pine softly, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder what she's like up there where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">say they've found silver?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The words fell upon Gaston's troubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit like skilled fingers upon the strings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a harp. Eagerly he began to talk. The lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle town fell away and he saw the long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston Olaf</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">185</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rough trail through the great rough North,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with who could know what sort of adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures at its end!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's a hard piece of country up there</seg><seg type="columnLine">from all I hear," interjected Tom Pine, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">harder than Sam Hill to get to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pooh! What was a little rough country?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Did any one expect to find metals stored up</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath city sidewalks? The harder the</seg><seg type="columnLine">better! None but real men could win in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All the more for the ones who were strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to stand the going.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaston rose and stood before Tom Pine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesticulating vehemently. The new lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone from his face; he felt as if a bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den had fallen from his shoulders. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly he thought of Rose and sat down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a while he arose and went slowly up</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the Havens home. He would go</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see her. He would settle it one way</seg><seg type="columnLine">or another that night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">i ROSE was working on something</seg><seg type="columnLine">a white when he found her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">" though she hastily dropped it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">her work-basket at his coming he saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a garment so tiny that in his ignor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance he fancied it must be for a doll.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that?" he asked. "Making a</seg><seg type="columnLine">doll dress?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes--no," she said, tucking her work out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sight. "That is--Gaston, you mustn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be so inquisitive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wha-a-at?" Her confusion puzzled him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was actually blushing. "What's there</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a doll's dress that you've got to hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">it from me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing, absolutely nothing. What do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you care about dolls' clothes, anyway?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then why don't you work at it? Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">let me interfere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It isn't polite to work when one's en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tertaining company," she bantered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on and work," he laughed. "I like</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see you sewing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sewing!" she said scornfully. "Oh, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorant men are! I wasn't sewing at all;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's embroidery. It will take weeks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks to finish it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Embroid-?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gaston!" He had playfully reached for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the garment. "Gaston! Well, I never!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was holding the tiny thing up in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge, brown hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Embroidery?" he repeated, looking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, and then he understood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, oh," he said slowly, and carefully</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced the dress in the basket. "I'm a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clod - hopper. I didn't understand; I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't have said a word or touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">it-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're as curious as a woman," she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tucking the garment out of sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I apologize; you see, I didn't know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know it." They looked at one an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who's it for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hulda, of course.

"The doc? Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll be darned!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop it! Not another word." Rose's</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-possession had returned. "Tell me, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">is going to drive the last spike in the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow? I've heard that the honor is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be given you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He answered aimlessly. His thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not with the road. The little garment</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spoken to him of certain things, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened his eyes to tender responsibilities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">marriage. And at last he was quite sure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself--quite sure that he had no right to</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to realize his dream. For whatever hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened, he must not run the risk of making</seg><seg type="columnLine">her unhappy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going away," he said, holding out</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought so," she said, and he was glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">she smiled. "I've seen it coming on you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They shook hands warmly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you going away for good?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He studied a moment before replying.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She would have Hale now, Hale, the steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">and responsible. She would be happy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he said, "thank God, it is for</seg><seg type="columnLine">good!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside, beneath the clear white stars, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathed to the bottom of his lungs. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done it. With a smiling face he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done it. And though the pain in his heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like a sharp knife he had the peace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind which told him he had done what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">•--square.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down the street he met the doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You old son-of-a-gun, you Doc!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled and smote him boyishly on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found Hale in his store.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hale," said he sternly, "you're a dam</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool. There's a girl up the street waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you and you stick down here and grouch</seg><seg type="columnLine">by yourself.

I'm going away. Going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay away. And if you don't go up there</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonight and get down to business I'll--I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">change my opinion of you.

Shake hands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went out of the store like a gust of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind, humming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When, he entered the doctor's old office</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time later he bore two blanket packs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuffed and strapped, ready for the trail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom Pine was asleep. Gaston dug out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">old woods-clothes and noiselessly made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete change. Arrayed as he was when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had come to the settlement--soft rubber</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes, buckskin trousers, muskrat cap, blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt and silken sash--he sat down for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment at the doctor's old table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His light-heartedness left him. He folded</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms on the table and laid his head upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. He had done what was square. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was hard. Oh, it was hardl</seg><seg type="columnLine">The picture of Rose as he had last seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, with the tiny white garment in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands--the picture he would carry away</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him--came before his eyes, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his head slowly. There was a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">wistful smile upon his bronzed face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thoughts of little children came to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him. His great arms curved hungrily on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table. Flesh of his flesh, bone of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone. Was he never to know what that</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant? The home, the wife, the children;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trinity that makes the world. He hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered for them then, with the strong man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunger, which the weakling never knows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he knew now that these were not for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. His was the lot of the roamer. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the open trail beneath untrammeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars, the life of abrupt change and excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, the lone but thrilling way of the bom</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventurer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Foot-loose and free. It had to be so. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be anything else. For he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">now that no ties could hold him when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">go-gods called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tom!" he called softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His old partner leaped up, wide awake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaston was standing by the bunk-side, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack on his shoulders, rifle in hand, ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, Tom; there's your pack. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon's up; we're going to travel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up on the crest of the ridge where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stood when they first saw the town,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they paused and looked back. The lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the settlement gleamed like pin-pricks in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness. One light gleamed particu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larly bright. Gaston looked at it a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time before turning his back. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw up his head and laughed, his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm pointing northward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The trail, Tom Pine, the trail!" he cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hit the trail!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE END</seg><seg type="columnLine">Author of "The Third Chance," "The Marrow-Bone," ctc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NUMBER of years ago, a pri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vate soldier of a certain British</seg><seg type="columnLine">regiment, then stationed at Cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutta, was sent to the Andaman</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islands--the Indian penal settlement--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve a life-sentence for murder. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were extenuating circumstances, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">name was William Driver. He believed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">no gods, though he swore by many, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">worshiped most devoutly one girl, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a very strong man. He was also a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crude person of limited education, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, Annie Hall, was the marrow-bone of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his existence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Therefore, in a most wonderful way, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped him to escape from the Andamans</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the deep forests of Burma, where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ideas of living in a tree. My old friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pickhead Cameron, who was at that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of the Forest Department, persuaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to build a hut, to which he added</seg><seg type="columnLine">comforts. He also persuaded them to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">married--by a Presbyterian missionary--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for many years he aided them, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were not discovered by that Govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment which paid his somewhat large salary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the course of time a baby was born to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Drivers, and the missionary baptized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the child, and Cameron was her godfather.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the girl, living alone in those wild for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ests with her parents, grew to be very lovely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">x</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On her eighteenth birthday Cameron gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">her a pearl necklace, and the missionary</seg><seg type="columnLine">her first communion. Shortly after, Cam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eron was called home to London, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">missionary, his work done, was called home</seg><seg type="columnLine">also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Bill Driver mourned their going, for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he said to his girl:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Cameron, he's gone to London, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I daren't go there; and Mr. MacNeil, he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone to heaven--so your mother says--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I carn't go there neither."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, Pickhead Cameron had so arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters that the Drivers saw no other hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mans; and Bill--who, by the way, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">only five-feet-six and weighed nearly two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred in hard condition--had done his</seg><seg type="columnLine">best to show his gratitude. Cameron's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride was in the administration of his for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ests, and Driver fully appreciated this, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he patrolled the district wherein he</seg><seg type="columnLine">abided and looked out for incipient fires</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other things. And when he wandered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the deep green of the mighty teak</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, he carried a rifle which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him for a long time, and for which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cameron supplied the ammunition. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">the carefully kept rifle always went the well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">polished bayonet. On the evening that Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his woman Annie escaped from the An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">damans, she clubbed a Sikh guard into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">87</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">insensibility--the source of the treasured</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, MacNeil and Cameron went home,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Driver still patrolled the district, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew Cameron would have him do. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking he did during his lonely walks was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an atavistic character, and he had some</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously anthropomorphic ideas regarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead MacNeil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE came an evening. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows were beginning to lie softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the dim forest places, and Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">Driver, hungry, sought his hut, his wife and</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter, and also his supper. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a mile from his home when his slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">working intelligence was startled by the cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a woman. And the voice of that woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the voice of his daughter--Annie the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill Driver hurled himself in the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of that cry, crashing through the inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vening brush like a shell from a big gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rifle went with him, but when he reach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed the small open space where his daughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">was struggling with a man, he dropped it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The red haze in which years before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shot and killed, again enveloped him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he could not forget--he had brooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">too long over it--that the mere pulling of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trigger had given him no physical satisfac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and had made him a convict, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">while justified in defending his own, mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ory bade him use the mighty clutch of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great hands in her defense, and, thus, sat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isfy the innate craving of the fighting man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Annie's assailant saw Bill coming--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">also must have heard him--and he released</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl and tried to escape. He might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped from an angry gorilla, but not from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill Driver. The strength of the gorilla and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Driver would be about equal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the convict's subconscious mind arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">several of his long dead fathers--hairy peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple who patronized no tailor. Bill was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of their presence, but their prompt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing swayed him. The man who struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">so impotently was a large man. Bill could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not see clearly, because of the red haze, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew quite well that it was his business</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tear the fellow to pieces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a preliminary, he broke both his cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive's arms. He dropped his almost swoon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing victim on the ground. It would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">do to kill him right away; that would be as</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsatisfactory as the shooting referred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been. He must pull the fellow to pieces</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, yet he must keep him in such a men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal condition that he would be fully and</seg><seg type="columnLine">excruciatingly aware of his dismemberment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill Driver, standing over a writhing hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, puzzled his slow brain. Then Annie</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second reached him, threw her arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">around his neck, and brought him out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the year 300,000 b. c. into a. d. 1912.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill Driver shook his bull-neck, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red fell away from his vision. But his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength and vindictiveness remained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go away, lass--he were trying to hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">thee more than thou knows abart."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, father?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I mun kill him, lass--an' he's going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know I'm doing it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But--don't you see he's a white man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't make no difference."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, father, it does.

We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have all heard of "dog-like devotion." But</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater than either of these was Bill Driver's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratitude to my old friend Pickhead Cam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eron.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He raised his writhing captive to a sit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting position, by gripping an ear between a</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger and thumb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wot you doing in these 'ere forests?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I vill not tell you," moaned the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh--you won't, eh?

Wot are ye doing here?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The captive's arms hung helplessly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Driver's method of supporting him was ago-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nizing. Nevertheless, he did not answer the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There must be something wrong," ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed Annie the second, clasping her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands nervously, "or he'd tell you, father.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You don't want Mr. Cameron's forests to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to no harm.

"You bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rifle, lass."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He threw his groaning captive across his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder and walked toward his hut at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">regulation quickstep that had never left</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, the girl following with the precious ri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fle.

Into this Driver flung his</seg><seg type="columnLine">captive; then he fastened him securely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to join his wife and daughter, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were eagerly discussing the affair. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother was all aflame also--for had not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in the outhouse tried to assault her</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, and did it not seem that he meant evil</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the beloved forests of Pickhead Cameron?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet they ate their supper with thorough</seg><seg type="columnLine">British regard for the inner-man, a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">creed which the growth of the Empire en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dorses daily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Once Driver left the meal, to roughly gag</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man in the outhouse; for the English</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to eat in comfort, and the crying of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wounded captive was disturbing. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Driver smoked a pipe and performed certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental processes almost analogous to think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "He'll tell," he remarked as he lit a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond pipe before proceeding to the outhouse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't heed his 'ollering--it's Mr. Camer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on's business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then he went to interview his captive;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that which he did was not nice.

But we leave convicts having their</seg><seg type="columnLine">little fun, so we get away without being</seg><seg type="columnLine">bothered by many wanting to go with us."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fun?" asked William Driver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes--we tell convicts about English wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill Driver's powerful body twitchcd</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely. About his lips was a slight froth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," added the prisoner. "English wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men--wives--girls--fifteen thousand black</seg><seg type="columnLine">murderers--very few soldiers--very little</seg><seg type="columnLine">ammunition."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A wounded gorilla will first scream, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutter automatically and continue to mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter.

Then I read a book about what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blacks did to the English women in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mutiny, Cawnpore and the like. And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">were scared that some black might do it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my Annie, and so I shot the first black I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw. It were foolish of me, because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks in India are now all decent folks, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept those they send to the Andaman Is-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands. They sent me to the Andamans for</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting the black, and I deserved it. Annie</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped me escape. I read it in a book.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Read just what them blacks will do when</seg><seg type="columnLine">your friends lets them loose. You won't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. And--my daughter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I do not know what Bill Driver did with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his captive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I know that he went to his hut obsessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the importance of a mission; that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of the pleadings of the women who</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved him, he gave certain orders and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">known his intention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wife and daughter were to do their</seg><seg type="columnLine">best to get to Moulmein, where there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">telegraph. If they got there, they were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see to it that the authorities sent a man-of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">war to the Andamans. As Bill put it:</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Receipt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">191</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will take maybe a week to get there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If I went, they'd want to know all about</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and they'd put me in jail.

There ain't no need to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell who I am, though I'd go anyhow. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">start for Moulmein."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So they parted at the little hut, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">midst of a circle of great teak trees, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">years before they had had notions of mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their home in one of them, where Pick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head Cameron had found them, and where</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacNeil had married them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BILL DRIVER, taking with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">some few stores and the precious</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle and bayonet, made a forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">march of twenty-six hours to the coast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he left the jungle at a tiny fishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">village, the haunting smell of the clear sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought memories of the fog-bound spirit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">England, and of the warmer wraith forbid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ding escape from the Andaman Islands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The tremulous stimulant of sentiment shiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered his spine with recollection, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched his rifle the more tightly as he cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cled the huts of the fishermen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quietly he laid his small stock of food and</seg><seg type="columnLine">water in the stern of a boat, cut the grass-rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">hawser and got aboard. There was a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">creaking when he hoisted the single sail, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fishermen were asleep and the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze was off the land. And Bill Driver</seg><seg type="columnLine">steered in the general direction of east and</seg><seg type="columnLine">south, down a wavering lane of moonlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seemed to beckon him along his not-</seg><seg type="columnLine">too-accurate course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is necessary to guess at the details of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that voyage. Nearly twenty years before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had crossed that same part of the Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ocean, in the scow known at the Andamans</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the "milk-boat," with the woman who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shown him the way of escape--and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible voyage it had been. For it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">only been by favor of the god of the chances</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had made the coast of Burma, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite their own heroic efforts. And what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">once told about it came from Annie, in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">main, for, as has also been told, Bill was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">teller of tales.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, regarding the voyage when he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, only guesses can be made, since he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went alone. Besides, there is another rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. But I am inclined to think, because I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been a sailor all my life and know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">limited was Bill's knowledge of the craft--I,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, state without fear of contradiction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the imperious, though ever-bibulous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">god of the chances again aided the man; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, furthermore, that same decadent deity</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevailed upon his brother tippler who rules</seg><seg type="columnLine">so laxily over the minor winds. For Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">Driver, by simply keeping his frail boat be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore it, made the harbor of Port Blair on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning of the seventh day. And dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the passage he saw no other ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The early morning mists were wreathing</seg><seg type="columnLine">into fantasies as Bill rounded the point.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These lifted suddenly, and the penal settle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment thrust itself into his vision, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing unpleasing about its appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance. The man stared at the place, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place seemed to stare back at the man, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man felt a sense of friendliness. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if he had met an old enemy, with whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had once fought a hard battle, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he now clasped hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And it was all the same--Hope Island,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had lived in his lonely hut; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">settlement of Port Blair, with the men's</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrack-like jail on that island, divided by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strip of water from the women's jail; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hilly island where the paroled convicts start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed independent life again, and, up the es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuary, Viper, where the worst characters</seg><seg type="columnLine">were confined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The harbor was empty, neither the guard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat nor the convict-carrying ship being</seg><seg type="columnLine">there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The breeze died, and Bill lowered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sail, and, with great effort got out the clum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sy oars. Dizzily he looked toward the bun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">galows of the officers, then he began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">row toward the chief commissioner's pri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vate wharf. When a convict it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">his business to row the milk boat from is-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land to island, and the chief commissioner's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wharf had been his first place of call.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The heavy oars seemed to have wills of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own, and Bill could hardly control</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. On the wharf a tall sikh guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">roused from his dozing and watched him</seg><seg type="columnLine">come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill Driver made the boat fast to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn cleet on the steps of the landing. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">192</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">clawed out of her like a man trying to scale</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cliff, and made his way feebly up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps on hands and knees. Half-way up he</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused and laughed vacantly, for he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered that he had reached the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">place and that his fearful voyage was over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It also occurred to him that he had eaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drank but little, and that he had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Abbe kitha jarlka?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill, at the head of the steps, looked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the voice. It was a long time since he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard Hindustanee spoken. Some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to know where he was going. Bill's</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul tried to tell the voice that it was none</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of that voice's - business, but his lips</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were working like an infant's at breast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, and the words he tried to get between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them trailed off into curious little noises</seg><seg type="columnLine">which mocked him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he forgot where he was going, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling to remember, memory asserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself over the vague impressions of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">present. And memory told Bill that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was again a convict confined, and that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had grown tired of the loneliness, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was going to kill the Sikh guard on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief commissioner's wharf, so that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be hanged and suffer no more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lay down on the rough planking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandered in the past.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His mind swirled to the boat he had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">left. There were two boats. No--one boat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had taken that boat from a Burman fish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing village, and he had grinned at the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he took it. From just behind that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon the voice again spoke to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you?" it said in English.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Bill Driver opened his eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up at the tall Sikh guard. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched feebly at his precious rifle. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sikh had grown gray in service, and Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">had changed also, but the men knew one</seg><seg type="columnLine">another at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Toom kady."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yus," muttered Bill, "it's me. This 'ere</seg><seg type="columnLine">was once your rifle--my girl hit yer, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took it. I ain't come to kill yer this time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Did yer know that one morning I were</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to throttle you? I went behind that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there hedge, and I trod on some English</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers wot were growing there, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smell of them made me weepy. My girl--</seg><seg type="columnLine">wot had come here as a maid to the chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">commissioner's sister -- found me there</seg><seg type="columnLine">blubbing. So, I didn't throttle yer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Sikh's rifle had followed every move-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of William Driver. Indeed, I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was only the uncanniness of his ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rival that saved him. The Sikh was super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitious, and Bill had not only reappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him out of the morning mists, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if the rugged personality of the famous</seg><seg type="columnLine">convict had suddenly and fearsomely thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself forth from the fathered years. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, he was supposed to be dead. Any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other man would have been dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when the guard felt quite sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his old enemy was not dead, he grinned re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lievedly behind his great beard. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped forward and removed the precious</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle from the unresisting fingers. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired his own rifle into the air and alarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the colony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Bill Driver, unable to stand, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">again conscious, glared up at the Sikh, look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for trouble and cursing his inability to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause it. The chief commissioner's bun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">galow was only about a hundred feet from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wharf, a carefully cultivated flower gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den separating. Consequently Sir George</seg><seg type="columnLine">Furlong was the first man to reach the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bot budmash waller hi, Burra Sahib," ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained the Sikh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the guard's explanation was not suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficiently particular. The chief commis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sioner only saw an exhausted white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched out on his private wharf--a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who was apparently a stranger to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">islands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who is he--what do you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill was so weak that when he looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">things they appeared to be separated from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him by a glass globe full of water. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking to the Sikh was not the old chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">commissioner of his time of captivity, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he loomed above him like an attenuated</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghost. Perhaps Bill guessed at his identity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By forcing all his will into his mighty mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cles he managed to raise his hand and sa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm Bill Driver, sir," he said, "wot--</seg><seg type="columnLine">got away--from here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he fainted again, as the wharf be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came crowded with half-dressed officers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. The doctor knelt by Driver's side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get some brandy. No, he's pretty well</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn out--a hypo's better."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun flooded the harbor, and Port</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blair glittered like a diamond. Two sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diers supported Bill whilst the contents of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hypodermic syringe warmed life into</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and the men and women on the chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Receipt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">193</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">commissioner's wharf watched in a tense si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence, plaided with the colors of speculation</seg><seg type="columnLine">and memory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And this was Bill Driver, the famous con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vict. The only man who had ever escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Andamans, and--a man whom a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman had really loved. Wonderful Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liam Driver! What was it you had that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made your Annie love you? It wasn't only</seg><seg type="columnLine">your strength. Other men might equal that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I almost can myself.

Why should</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tender Fate who tries to arrange the</seg><seg type="columnLine">love-affairs of men have made a special ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort on your behalf? For--a woman loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">you for yourself alone! Then how had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">come back to the penal settlement--where</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he been all the years--and for what</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason had he returned?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I read it in a book," muttered Bill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, yes, we know," said the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">soothingly. "But that was very long ago."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Abart a week--a long week," muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor studied him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No fever.

The first aban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don of freedom had worn itself out, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some were beginning to see a rift in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">altruism of the two foreigners who had freed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The fingers of many dead pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an unpleasing end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An ancient murderer nibbled at a piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dried fish, and spoke between nibbles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They came," he said, "and they cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured the Ag boat, on which they put their</seg><seg type="columnLine">many-mouthed guns. They sailed close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the British have made them a fort,</seg><seg type="columnLine">194</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and, the water being shallow, they ground-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed. With much effort they got off. Mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">while, their men let us go free--telling us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">seek revenge and the white women. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my brothers, what is the reason of this do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing? In what way are these two white men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who are not English, interested in our en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joyments. Many of us are dead, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">English still hold the fort."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is said that they hate the English be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause they are white, yet are not English--</seg><seg type="columnLine">being of a lower caste," suggested another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that there is a great war coming,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after which there will be no more English;</seg><seg type="columnLine">at which time all men will be free," said a</seg><seg type="columnLine">third.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Free," sneered the ancient. "Who is</seg><seg type="columnLine">free? What is free? Even a rajah is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">free. By his women is he enslaved as are</seg><seg type="columnLine">others by opium. When this matter of kill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the English in this place is concluded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what then? Suppose it is but the revenge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the two white men who are not English.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, we will have helped at that revenge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had our fill of women's screams. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">will the two white men want to take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mayo Ag boat and go back to their place</seg><seg type="columnLine">--which will show us their wisdom. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">brothers--" he leaned forward in the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle--"we, who are wise men, and friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">must see to it that we, also, go from here in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Mayo Ag boat. I have a memory that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the British Government has a long arm."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It might have been wise," said another</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully, "had we gone to the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the British. They have a lion for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">caste-mark, and ever do many seek to kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lion. He is a sleepy lion and wakes</seg><seg type="columnLine">but slowly. But when he does wake he</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes the jungle tremble with his rage, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the lesser beasts hide from him. Did</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not my father tell me-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so on. There was infinite chatter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Relatives and old cronies in crime</seg><seg type="columnLine">jubilated over the cooking-pots. The wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men prisoners had their peculiar place in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the orgy. The dark closed over a chorus of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nasty noises. The few little circles of old</seg><seg type="columnLine">men gabbled wisely, but the mass was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtless horde craving many things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BILL DRIVER, rubbing his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one great hand and trailing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">precious rifle with the other, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reported himself to the captain in command</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the white soldiers. And that officer had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said things to William which made him feel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lumpy inside, made him feel that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">just about lick a hundred of the enemy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Very much embarrassed, he tried to explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">this feeling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm only a third-class shot," he stam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered, "but I'm useful with the butt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">baynit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And over it all hung the peculiarly peace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful smell of the wood fires. The bats flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. In the creeks and estuaries the mist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wraiths began to form.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was a hideous unanimity about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the killing of the garrison, which was fos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered exceedingly when some genius of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">convict found the commisariat sergeant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">store of wines and spirits. There are cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain castes in India that profess to abhor</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink, but religion is at times elastic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The machine guns spluttered. The de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fenders fired at the advancing menace, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrain favored the convicts with every</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of cover, and they were able to creep</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost up to the defenses before attacking</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their axes, adzes and weapons looted</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Mayo. It must be remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there were about fourteen thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">convicts, and that the two machine guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">effectually prevented any sortie of the gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rison which was so very short of ammuni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the whole affair had been so unex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected, so unprepared for. Many of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">defenders felt that they were in a hideous</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightmare, out of which they would wake</seg><seg type="columnLine">in due time; and in that belief many died.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Description of it all is as impossible as would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the description of a burning building. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fight, fight, fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The drink worked in the convicts and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon set. Then they began firing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses, making a glimpse of an indecent</seg><seg type="columnLine">hell as they ran about with torches. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever the ammunition in the little fort dwin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dled. Thus, with all Port Blair ablaze, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last round was served out, and the men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">told of this fact. Some grinned, some swore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some said nothing, each after his fashion;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but all grimly held on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shortly before daylight an order was</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered to certain men. It had to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the use of the shells in some revolvers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These were on no account to be fired at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dark lifted to the kiss of the dawn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The breath of morning moved over the har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bor. The ammunition of the defenders was</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhausted. The convicts came on, careless</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Receipt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">195</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of creed distinction, howling in a reeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">frenzy--Hindoos, Mohammedans, every</seg><seg type="columnLine">caste known to India and Burma. The set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlement echoed to their yells as they swirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then humanity clashed at the breast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">works, and voices melted into a sort of hum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashed with curses and weapons meeting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oaths from every one of that little group</seg><seg type="columnLine">of islands in the grim North Sea mingled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the fighting gutturals of the valiant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sikh guards, dying for the honor of the salt</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had eaten. And B il 1 D river and his old-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time enemy of the chief commissioner's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wharf found themselves side by side. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned at each other through sweat-clut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered faces and parried and thrust in a glor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ious spirit of comradeship. Yet the drunk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">en degenerates prevailed. The defenders</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not give way--they fought till they fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">and died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over the souls of certain men who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been told off to do a certain clean deed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the few remaining shells in the revolvers</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread a horror of that duty. These looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">furtively at the women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun rose over burning, blackened Port</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blair and flushed at the screaming filth it</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted. Certain men agreed that the gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rison could not last five minutes longer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These looked at each other; then they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not look at each other. They staggered to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the group of women and girls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She came round the point--a gray, lithe</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape, cleared for action, her ensign snap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping angrily. And as she came her guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed at the scum that had almost surged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its desire. Her boats dropped from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">davits, and, loaded with armed marines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove at the beach. The women had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been cheaply protected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN WAYS beyond my understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, the pleading of Annie the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">had prevailed against the precedent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of regulation, and the captain of the cruiser</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought her, and Annie the second with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. That she was liable to imprisonment</seg><seg type="columnLine">for conniving at her man's escape was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">detail she ignored entirely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was the marrow-bone of Bill Driver's</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, and, therefore, she knew that her place</seg><seg type="columnLine">was by his side. And, searching frantically</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the wounded and dead, she found</seg><seg type="columnLine">him lying unconscious, across the body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sikh guard, among the carefully culti-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vated English flowers in the chief commis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sioner's garden. And while Annie the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond ran for the doctor--over-busy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">other wounded men -- the marrow-bone</seg><seg type="columnLine">took Bill's head on her lap and petted him</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to consciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Amid her kisses, he indicated the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sikh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He were a man, lass," he muttered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm most sorry you hit him when we got</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from 'ere--though we did need the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle mortal bad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the doctor came; and after a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">while that doctor nodded slowly. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Annie the first, dry-eyed and beyond sobs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the meaning of it. The chaplain be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan the prayer he had so often used, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill interrupted. He could not see very</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly, but the haze clouding him was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">different from the red haze of his passions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Scuse me, sir," he said weakly. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">doc says I'm dying?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, my man," said the doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chaplain began to pray again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to speak to the chief commis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sioner," said Bill Driver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chief commissioner, his left arm in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sling and his head bandaged, leaned over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Annie's shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Driver--what is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a vast effort Bill saluted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know abart me, sir--escaped con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vict?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, my man, but that's all right.

J. R. was one. Deck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand in the crew of five men. Night and</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, good weather and bad, that boat has</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run. First thing at daybreak they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hustle out to get provisions from shore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quarter of bloody beef maybe, and two or</seg><seg type="columnLine">three sacks of spuds; then along about nine</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain has to go ashore on official busi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, and boat and crew have to be spotless</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smiling. Then there's the liberty par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties and the mail and twenty other things</seg><seg type="columnLine">which keep the launch crew humping them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves twenty hours a day. J.

That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the morning we had to beat it out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our anchorage in a little place called Cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pus Christi, to keep from piling up on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach. The bay there is just a little cup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped affair and safe enough with an off-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore wind, but when one of those West</seg><seg type="columnLine">India storms come up and it blows in from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old Caribbean, it's no place for a ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">to spend any time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We were in a hurry to get out, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were rolling around pretty lively.

The anchor-chain was something awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">to handle, covered with a kind of sticky</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue mud, volcanic they call it, and things</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in such a rush that we couldn't take</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to wash it with a hose as it came over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side, which was customary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "J.

The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them shouted for help. That's all they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do. Shere couldn't get out and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chain still coming it would soon have</seg><seg type="columnLine">him covered and crushed to death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the noise on deck we didn't hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. It was blowing like sin by then and</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody was working to save the ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The first we knew J.

A kink in the chain had made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man at the winch slack back a little and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took this flying chance to get on deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">before we started to heave in again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hereditary Evidence</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">199</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There was only half a minute's delay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the chain commenced to come in again</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he could get to the boatswain. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">make himself heard he jumped up on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">taut chain and shouted to belay. Then it</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The chain struck another snarl, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winch man threw on more power, and just</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the short break at the hause pipe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chain parted. Poor J. R. caught the full</seg><seg type="columnLine">snap of it. It threw him twenty feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he struck on his head. Broke his neck. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">died instantly trying to save a friend."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sailor stopped. His story was end-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed.

Did they save him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stubby shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too late," he said, and Hundley finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him: "That's how Stubby lost his fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers, trying to get Shere out. Couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fathoms of chain rolled them flat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dad Regan slowly took his feet from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rungs of the stool and stood up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to thank you two boys," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">still a little shakily.

I'll be ridin' with ye,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I'll be in the cab."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke without boastfulness, yet with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride.

They saw him jump briskly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his place in the cab of the giant engine which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to take them over the Coal Dust Divi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. From the steps he waved a farewell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A fine old man," said Hundley as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two sailors walked to their coach. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnnie certainly was a throw-back. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">made you do what you did, Stubby?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess your first words answer that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's a fine old man. I couldn't break his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart by telling him that his son was a low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, miserable coward."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You could have played ignorant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And increase the old man's suspicions?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Didn't you see that he was worried because</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody had ever written him the details?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And besides, I for one have never been</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite sure about Regan. All the ship ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">had was what Shere said when he was half</seg><seg type="columnLine">delirious, in the hour before he died."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wasn't that enough? What're you driv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in' at? You know as well as I do that John-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nie Regan could have helped Shere out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">got out himself if he hadn't had cold feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and deserted like a coward.

The road</seg><seg type="columnLine">went up hill and down dale, and the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines toiled laboriously up, spouting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud of black smoke from their stacks, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled ponderously down, with a roar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinding brakes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dad Regan with his heavy string of sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, and mail and express coaches, stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the summit of Squirrel Ridge for orders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Below him was a long stretch of straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">track. It led down into the valley and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">up another ridge to the Honeycomb Mine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the custom for the engineers to "tear</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a strip" going down in order to get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">running start for the stiff grade ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">200</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All clear!" shouted the operator above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roar of the panting engine, as Dad</seg><seg type="columnLine">Regan and his conductor came into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little office for their orders; and a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments after Regan started his train down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This particular section of the division was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of its worst places. There was no switch</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the valley between, and if a coal-car or an</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty string got away from the busy yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Honeycomb, after a train had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">Squirrel' Ridge, they ran together at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom and smashed things up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So far nothing serious had happened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cars had run wild, and once the local had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to back up the ridge in a hurry, but up un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til the day that Dad Regan started down</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Overland, there had been no wreck</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth the name. Even the request of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roadmaster for a derailing switch had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">no further than permission for the prelimi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary grading.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Dad Regan came roaring down, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept his eyes constantly on the summit</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead. At the Ridge he had waited for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long coal-train to creep up and go safely</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the clear. He knew that since the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">trains were routed over this division that</seg><seg type="columnLine">every precaution was being taken against</seg><seg type="columnLine">an accident, but still he watched. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the bottom, going fifty miles an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, he looked away for a moment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooked the big machine up another notch</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the stiff climb ahead. When he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out again the thing that he dreaded most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all had happened. His fireman saw it at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dad!" he shrieked. "Dad! Look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">what's cornin'!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dad had already looked. He shut off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, opened the sand and jammed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brakes. The heavy train, already taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grade, slowed almost instantly. Seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaded coal "gons" had broken away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were coming down the hill without a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to set a hand-brake, even if that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done any good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When she stops, jump, and uncouple the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine," ordered Dad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fireman looked at him questioningly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dad picked up a wrench.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick!" he commanded again, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fireman hit the ground at the same time</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the train came to a jerky, rumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were two other things that Dad</seg><seg type="columnLine">Regan could have done--try to back his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">train out of danger up the hill behind him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or jump and save himself, and try to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passengers out before the coal-train</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck. Either of these two ways was dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerous to his passengers, and comparatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe for himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The runaway was coming at such speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Dad felt sure they could not get away</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the first plan, and as for clearing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coaches of their human freight, it was out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the question, unless there had been ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes for every one that was available.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were babies, and invalids, and skep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tics who would not leave their baggage, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dad knew it. He took the only safe course</seg><seg type="columnLine">to save his train, and had weighed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances and made up his mind in the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onds while his hands were busy stopping</seg><seg type="columnLine">his engine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shouted once more and brandished</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wench as his fireman hesitated over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the automatic coupling. A moment more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the coaches commenced to roll gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">away behind him, and he was free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the step of a man of thirty he sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his levers and started the big overland</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine up the hill to meet the onrushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">coal-cars. They were coming in a cloud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust and with the rumble of a landslide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dad's plan was to meet them head-on as</seg><seg type="columnLine">far up the slope as he could, and let the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy engine derail and wreck them. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">must stand by too, for the engine must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed and the grade was steep.

Their progress had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been scarcely a dozen miles since sunrise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vong gazed, too, at the sand sea darken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing under the slow twilight, and then looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Gilbertson in a silent reproach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "- it!" shouted Gilbertson when his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes rested once more on those of the Chi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nese. "Don't look at me that way! You</seg><seg type="columnLine">give me the willies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vong slid down the sand-slope without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word and stood eagerly over the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deepening hole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he watched the three below him Gil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bertson felt that they were discussing him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a manner of hostility in the cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ert glances they cast upward toward him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A wind blew more coldly upon him there</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the crest of the dune, and he shivered at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought that tonight there would be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire in camp. They had passed the last out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posts of the dead tamarisk trees that linger</seg><seg type="columnLine">far into the desert--age-old tombed senti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nels of the period when the sand-waste was</seg><seg type="columnLine">watered and fertile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The digger's head was out of sight now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Gilbertson scrambled down to share in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the toil. Crumbling walls made it neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary to widen the opening of the pit and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">digging went on with painful slowness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sand thrown up from the bottom still</seg><seg type="columnLine">was moist but seemed to grow no moister.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Last night they had been compelled to dig</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight feet before they reached water. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mud stratum, that might have been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed of a buried stream, yielded only enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to half fill the water-bags. For the almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhausted camels there was nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they had been at work nearly three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours, and the pit had reached a depth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourteen feet, they gave up the quest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw themselves on the sand. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no hope that water could be reached here</seg><seg type="columnLine">by digging. The desert wind shrieked bit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terly at them with its breath of frost, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they lay panting from their disappointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a time they rose and with one ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord went to the water-bags, still unslung</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the wearied camels. There was enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">for tonight but none for tomorrow. The ice-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bags, too, carried for days from the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Woman of the Desert</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">205</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">outpost of fertility, were almost empty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was enough, perhaps, for another</seg><seg type="columnLine">day's march.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One by one the men drew cupfuls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">muddy water from the pathetically limp</seg><seg type="columnLine">water-bags. There still was enough for tea</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be made over the alcohol burner. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate their evening meal in silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Gilbertson rolled himself in his sleeping-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sack and lay down on the sand floor be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath his tent, and for a time listened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the low voices of his men, trying vainly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make out the trend of their earnest collo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quy. It was easy enough to guess, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">realization of it made him pull his revolver</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its holster and look at its chambers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had anticipated some such crisis and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was prepared for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vong came into the tent, without apology</seg><seg type="columnLine">for intruding upon his master's privacy--</seg><seg type="columnLine">something he had never done before. Gil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bertson slipped out of his sleeping-bag and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two confronted each other, squatting on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their heels under the low canopy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tomorrow we go back," announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Gilbertson laughed, a very dry and mirth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go back? You're crazy! The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing we can do is to go on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No water," muttered Vong sullenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There may be water tomorrow--we</seg><seg type="columnLine">must find it. We can't be more than two</seg><seg type="columnLine">days from the Keriya River, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">there'll be plenty of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Vong only shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The coolie and the camel-driver--they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not go further. They will go back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbertson pulled the revolver from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster and examined it meaningly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They will not go back, Vong," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a low voice. "Look here," he continued,</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting away the gun when he saw how lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle effect it had upon the demeanor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sullen Vong. "We haven't enough food to</seg><seg type="columnLine">last until we get back. And the camels</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't stand it. They're nearly exhaust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed now. We've been out twenty-six days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and every desert-traveler since Marco Polo</seg><seg type="columnLine">agrees that it's only a thirty-day trip. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">can hold out for two or three days more</seg><seg type="columnLine">even without water. And we're sure to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty of it by digging when we're nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river. There's nothing for it but to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, Vong."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Water--no water," was all Vong would</seg><seg type="columnLine">say in reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Gilbertson turned from him in dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gust. These Chinese were children when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to anything like a crisis demanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardship and fortitude against known dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Vong had gone Gilbertson drew out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the worn volume of Marco Polo's travels</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been the inspiration of his venture</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the desert, if there had been anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">like inspiration for it. He turned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage in the immortal work that tells of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great "Desert of Lop."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even to handle the volume was a refresh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing assurance. True, the Ser Marco had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not crossed this part of the desert, but des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erts were much alike. What was true of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polo's "Desert of Lop" would be sufficient-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly true here. There were many who crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Takla-makan. He would by no means</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the first, though the route was little</seg><seg type="columnLine">known and much feared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One could not go wrong, knowing the di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection and possessing the strength, Gilbert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son thought. In four days more, five at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most, he should reach the southern edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desert, the goal of his expedition. Kho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tan was the city from which he hoped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make his explorations into the sand-buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitations of dead centuries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbertson was an adventurer who looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to adventure as its own reward and its only</seg><seg type="columnLine">aim. If he discovered a buried city it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be to enrich archeology or geography.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was not greatly interested in filling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smithsonian Institution with new treasures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was interested only in finding diversion</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Yoland Gilbertson, who claimed no home</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the world at large, and who was bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">by no ties save those of the universal kin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was this vagueness of purpose and ut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter absence of serious intent that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">prompted him to leave Harvard in the midst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his work for a master's degree and sail</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Europe on a cattle-boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A personal interest, but no particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose, had led him to spend weeks in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slums and among the docks of Liverpool.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stevenson's "Adventures with a Donkey,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely enough, had inspired him to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendicant jaunt through Germany and</seg><seg type="columnLine">France, living, as he put it, "on the staff of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the universal brotherhood." What impulse</seg><seg type="columnLine">had led him to Mexico he never was able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say definitely, but the spy duty he un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dertook for a certain revolutionist general</seg><seg type="columnLine">had its climax in front of a gray adobe wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">206</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at daybreak in the Mexican capital, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an attache of the American embassy dash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up to the executioners' squad just in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to halt an unnecessarily violent flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mauser bullets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Various parts of South America had</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed him briefly and to no particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose, save once, to assist United States</seg><seg type="columnLine">army officers in cleaning up a fever dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trict. For this he was nearly rewarded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">death from the disease he fought. In Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aska he had found gold, but resigned it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman whose crippled father held a bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ren claim next to it. The woman had wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to marry him, but he had no such notion</seg><seg type="columnLine">--never had such an idea at any time in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life--so he went to a place as near as pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible the antipodes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not surprising that, finding him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in Shanghai and without funds, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have offered to sell pills for an Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ican patent-medicine company. The man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ager of the concern sent him forth in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the cholera and dysentery season</seg><seg type="columnLine">to canvass the villages of tie flat, reeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yangtze basin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbertson came back in a few weeks with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a creditable knowledge of Chinese, an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">impaired constitution and tremendous prof-</seg><seg type="columnLine">its from the pills. Under the influence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his oratory on street corners and in temple</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards the natives had bought his wares for</seg><seg type="columnLine">all ills. These marvelous pellets would cure</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything! Strangely, they did seem to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracles. The lame and the halt and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disease - stricken had seemed to become</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole under the "foreign magic-pills."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On his next excursion Gilbertson was sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">further afield. He tired of the r61e of heal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er, and finding himself in the remote west-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern provinces of China determined to desert</seg><seg type="columnLine">his employers and march away over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserts and mountains of Central Asia, along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the route of the great Marco Polo and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the almost obliterated threshold of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back door of Europe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbertson put away the volume of Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">co Polo, blew out the candle, and, fingering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the holster of his revolver to give himself a</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater feeling of security, composed him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self for sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HIS hands were pinioned as in vises</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he came to a sudden, startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakening. His three companions</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood over him threateningly, and Vong was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unstrapping the holster of the revolver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Gilbertson struggled vainly, then ceased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They let him up and all four scrambled from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the tent. Outside they stood silently, de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fiantly, under the cold desert stars, with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sand-murmuring blasts of the great waste</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shrieking through them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We go now--back to the last water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole," announced Vong triumphantly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then one man goes on with the strongest</seg><seg type="columnLine">camel for more food--more camels."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can go and be- to you," Gil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bertson snarled at them. "I'll stay. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep going the other way--south. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow vermin! A thousand curses on all</seg><seg type="columnLine">your ancestors!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Gilbertson'sl rage and impotence gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a sort of giddy feeling. The air seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of lights and noises. He wondered if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he were becoming suddenly ill. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of the evil spirits with which su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perstitious natives people the desert, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed until his voice stirred disturbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">,echoes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A passage from the book of Marco Polo</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to stand out before his eyes:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sometimes stray travelers will hear as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the tramp and hum of a great caval-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cade of people away from the real line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">road, and taking this to be their own com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany they will follow the sound; and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">day breaks they find that a cheat has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">put on them and that they are in an ill</seg><seg type="columnLine">plight. Even in the daytime one hears</seg><seg type="columnLine">those spirits talking. And sometimes you</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall hear the sound of a variety of musical</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments, and still more commonly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of drums. Hence in making this</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey 'tis customary for all travelers to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">keep close together-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Gilbertson laughed again in a voice that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">caused his companions to glance at one an-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other with a curious significance. Then he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">went into the tent, wrapped himself into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his sleeping-bag and tossed in a feverish</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slumber until daybreak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  His companions were gone, he found, as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he left the tent. So were all but one of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">camels--the poorest of the lot--and this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one gazing with a patient yearning in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">direction his fellows had taken. Food</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">enough to last three or four days had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">left for him, and a small cake of ice. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">marveled at this human justice of the sand-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sea mutineers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For an hour Gilbertson hesitated over</seg><seg type="columnLine">which course to take. Should he acknowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge himself beaten and set out to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Woman of the Desert</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">207</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his companions, or should he push on into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the unknown?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The devil spirits of the desert, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were about him, whispering to be off--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow them into the waste. In the end he</seg><seg type="columnLine">yielded and went their way southward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing laboriously up the slopes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great sand ranges, and at every crest strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling against new disappointment at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unchanging character of the landscape. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">must walk now, leading the camel, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor beast, weakened by his long fast, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficiently burdened with the meager camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the long day Gilbertson stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered, and when night came he found him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self too weary for digging. Half the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious ice went for his tea, and when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">eaten he slept in a stupor of exhaustion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before dawn he was awake and had se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lected a low gully between two towering</seg><seg type="columnLine">dunes for his digging. He found then that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his companions had taken the only spade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he was compelled to sacrifice the alcohol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burner for conversion into a rude scoop. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">began an agony of labor that lasted for</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours, with only bitterness and exhaustion</seg><seg type="columnLine">for reward. The sand at six feet showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a slight trace of moisture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A sort of calm resignation succeeded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first panic of disappointment. Gilbertson</seg><seg type="columnLine">was able to whistle a few bars of the latest</seg><seg type="columnLine">popular song that had been going the rounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Shanghai music-halls before he left</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this trip; but the whistling only aggra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vated his thirst. He approached the silent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wistful camel and looked into the beast's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopeless eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Not much longer for this world, are you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">old boy?" Gilbertson could not help saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The sound of his voice, so many hours si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent, startled him. A faint echo came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sand-dunes, and he looked up, half ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecting to glimpse somewhere another hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. The mute sand-crests, stretching in</seg><seg type="columnLine">endless confusion, rebuked his thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was with difficulty that he got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camel to his feet. The beast seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">given up the fight. His vitality was gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He soon would be a part of the inanimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">void about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Gilbertson pitied the animal and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have given him the brotherly caress a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">gives his horse had not a leering curl of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips warned him the camel probably would</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintain his attitude of vicious repugnance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">toward humans even in the shadow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. Those foul teeth must still keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two from the intimate companionship of</seg><seg type="columnLine">common danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They swayed slowly through the track-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less sand, animate derelicts mutually repug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nant but mutually dependent for life itself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The gray sky seemed to creep down upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and the wind seemed to mock</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with its spiteful buffetings of drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbertson had let his watch nm down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he had little need of it. His eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the needle of his compass, and for a sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of relief in the still unchanging southern</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon. Time was of no consequence. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">him space was the only dimension, water</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only element that mattered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toward the middle of the afternoon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camel faltered near the top of a dune steep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er than any they had encountered before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slid feebly backward into the gully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a moan of infinite melancholy he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched his gaunt neck along the sand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay still. Though Gilbertson beat and kick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed at him, then spoke to him softly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">words of Turkoman camel-drivers, the beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not respond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Gilbertson lay down in the sand, his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his arms, and tried to think. It had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways been his theory that the mind is</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger than the body. The mind must</seg><seg type="columnLine">find a way where the body could not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reviewed the course of the whole ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedition, counted over the number of days</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been on the march, the estimated</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of miles traveled; he went over in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind all the road lore of the desert that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had picked up in the city at the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand-sea, and reasoned that the sum of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not have led him astray. Truly, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less the compass was wrong, or the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">altered, or the sun and stars changed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their courses, he must, if he kept on, come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the southern edge of the desert. To go</seg><seg type="columnLine">back--well, that was impossible now. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">must go on, as long as his strength held</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. That was the only solution. He must</seg><seg type="columnLine">go on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strength seemed to fill him--the strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">of desperation. He sprang up, fumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">feverishly among the camp equipment on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fallen camel for the small quantity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">food he must take, and the remainder of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice. It required tremendous force of will to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep from consuming the whole of the piti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully small lump of frozen treasure in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">208</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">single orgy of gratification. But he crunched</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbertson did not look back at the dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">camel as he reached the crest of the dune</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slid down into the opposite gully. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">haste was too great. He was devoid of sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">timent. He had neither pity, nor remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brance, nor any emotion. There was noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in his mind save the compelling desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to consume the one dimension that was of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any consequence. There was but one goal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one aim in life, one thing of value--water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was not conscious of sand-hills or of</seg><seg type="columnLine">suns. Presently the stars were out but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not seem aware of it. He kept on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">toiling, panting, reeling through the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This could not continue endlessly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">faltered at last near the top of a steep dune,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the camel had done, and fell back, sliding</seg><seg type="columnLine">helplessly to the bottom. He tried again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but exhaustion overcame him in the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt and he did not rise from the gully</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time, but remained, sprawling, face up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward to the stars. Then he slept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun and his thirst awoke him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not seem to feel the cold, though in it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the chill of frost. Dazedly he felt for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ice, and in a delirium of haste crunched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last of his small treasure. When he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was gone a sober fear overcame him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He reviled himself for having eaten it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw himself down with his face in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand. There was almost childishness in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">petulance of his grief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the precious liquid had given new</seg><seg type="columnLine">life to his blood, and restored some of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength. He ate something and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumble on, ever southward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At nightfall his thirst was agonizing. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips were parched and his tongue swollen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was hungry, but he could not eat. Food</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked him; he could not swallow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He began digging at the bottom of a gully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the intervals of utter exhaustion and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep that overcame him at times he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued digging through the night. At dawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had made a hole six feet deep. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand was moist but he knew that to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">water it would be necessary to go many</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet deeper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sitting on the edge of his dry water-hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thought came to him suddenly and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him rage hoarsely at the sky. Why had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">not drunk the blood of the dying camel?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he ceased his shrieking at the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wondered if he were going mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He decided to die, peacefully, respectably,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked about him for a sand-crest that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a fitting monument. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had chosen one he climbed to the top of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disinterestedly surveyed the sand-sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afterward it seemed to him that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed for some time at an object below him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the southern slope of the dune before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized in the least what it was. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware that it was a dead camel long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he perceived the significance of it. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dully, the thought came to him that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own camel, and that he had made his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way back to it through some sickening error</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the compass or in his reading of the stars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when he had rolled nearer to the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject he saw that it was not his camel. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind had driven the stench of it away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him during the night but could not protect</seg><seg type="columnLine">him now. He was nauseated and his illness</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a time robbed him of the strength to</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawl away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun shone full in his eyes, yet there</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to him to be a great grayness over</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything. Through this grayness he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed at a bit of curious silver inlay in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle of the fallen camel, and managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawl close to it in a childish fit of curiosity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His reward was the ghastly discovery that</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the camel's body was that of a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">--unmistakably the Chinese official of Kho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tan who had gone into the desert with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peking concubine. In the dead hands was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched a carbine, the muzzle of which now</seg><seg type="columnLine">was poked impotently into the sand. Across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's face was dried a streak of blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In Gilbertson's eyes the grayness in -</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased and then became utter darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE outlaw village nestling</seg><seg type="columnLine">along fertile banks of an out-crop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping of the desert-buried river, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been tremendous excitement all morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. The foreign man the wild-camel hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers had brought in yesterday was "ajive"</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and the Chinese woman, whose hus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">band they had shot and afterward robbed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat by the man's side talking in a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">language. She had ceased to cry out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">death when she saw him, and now wept</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently as she talked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The language Gilbertson and the Chinese</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman spoke was German. She had ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed him in German because he was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreigner and that was the language she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned when her father was on foreign</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Woman of the Desert</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">209</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">service for the old Empress. He was able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reply in German with what knowledge he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gained of it in his vagabondage, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">each would have understood the other bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter in mandarin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is this place?" asked Gilbertson</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakly, when she had somewhat dried her</seg><seg type="columnLine">tears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It has no name," answered the woman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The people are outlaws--they dare not</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the desert."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How did they happen to find me--by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way, what happened to you two, out</seg><seg type="columnLine">there?" pointing to the desert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They shot him," she shuddered.

The chief, when he heard of it, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">them return. The Amban was dead, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they found you there, almost dead too."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What will they do with us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The old chief is sick.

He was a tall, powerful Mongol, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen, intelligent eyes. Clearly he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the inferior breed of Turkoman camel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunters about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Zahid Beg, the chief," he said to Gil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bertson in the Kansu dialect, "desires your</seg><seg type="columnLine">attendance. Can you walk, or must you be</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think I had better be carried into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">royal presence," replied Gilbertson, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no such levity in his tone as in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They picked him up and in a few paces</seg><seg type="columnLine">set him down in a hut larger than the others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the emaciated form of an old man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Medicine!" demanded the sick man in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dialect that had to be translated.

Still, he thought, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be well to experiment with the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Gratitude, perhaps, would give him</seg><seg type="columnLine">his freedom from what otherwise might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">perpetual servitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is the reward if I make you well?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked of the old chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mongol muttered hoarsely and drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of his hand across his throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you do not--" he threatened savagely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the old chief looked more kindly upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cure me," he said, "and you shall have</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you ask: a garden, a house, a wife--</seg><seg type="columnLine">though of women there are few. You shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">choose from among them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The promise did not give Gilbertson great</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction, but he thought he saw in it</seg><seg type="columnLine">some advantage. With all the impressive-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness he could muster he took the old man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulse, looked into his eyes, examined his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue, moved his arms up and down as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">in first aid for the drowning--and then drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth the pills. Rolling one into his palm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he muttered over it solemnly the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines of Virgil's /Eneid, and_ then popped it</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the old man's mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With greater assurance even than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">haughty Mongol, Chang Ssu-yeh, Gilbert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son disdained the carriers who had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into the hut and strode forth to his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For three days the village paid homage</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, though Chang scowled over it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate of the fat of the oasis. Each day he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went with pomp and circumstance to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief's hut and administered a pill. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third day the chief arose, walked from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut, and announced himself not only cured</seg><seg type="columnLine">but refilled with the fires of youth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What a testimonial, thought Gilbertson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this would be for the pill company if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could but work it up into ad copy!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Zahid Beg's first official act was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">proclaim a public banquet in honor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great medicine man. At this banquet Gil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bertson was plied with so much honor it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearied him. The climax came when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old chief announced Gilbertson's reward for</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising him from a sick bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The honorable pill-doctor," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beg, "shall have one of the finest melon</seg><seg type="columnLine">gardens.

For his wife he shall take</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman from the desert, who comes also</seg><seg type="columnLine">from distant peoples, and knows his man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner of speech. I have said--so must it be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were only two at the banquet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board who did not join in the uproar of ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plause. They were Gilbertson and Chang</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ssu-yeh. Gilbertson did not notice Chang's</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowering silence, for he was too busy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious solicitude over himself. Neverthe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, with Chang for interpreter, he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignified response and accepted the chief's</seg><seg type="columnLine">generosity. It was impossible to do less.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In three days, the old chief announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">further, would the nuptials take place. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morrow a house would be built to shel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter the bride. In the meantime, to respect</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proprieties, the woman from the desert</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be housed with the chief's own fam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily. Let there be great rejoicing and a gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral holiday.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbertson strode away from the ruins of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the feast to refresh himself with air and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">contemplation. He still was too much of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity to go unaccompanied by a trail of</seg><seg type="columnLine">urchins and dogs, but he had lived in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">East long enough to become accustomed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding his needed solitude in entire indiffer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence to encompassing crowds of the curious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He strolled through the straggling village</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther than he had gone before, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised to see the extent of ruined struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, half covered with sand, that spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">eloquently of buried generations. From his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of the sand-smothered cities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desert, and the fabulous stories told of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the romance and the richness of them, Gil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bertson recognized in this extensive reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ruin what probably was a city of many</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand inhabitants. The treacherous and</seg><seg type="columnLine">inconstant river probably had shifted its</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream to another bed and left the city to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fate of parching winds and drifting sands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now it was back again and feeding this col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ony of outlaws into renewed semblance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city it once destroyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Desiccated timbers, impossible to say how</seg><seg type="columnLine">old, protruded from the sand--the gaunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">skeletons of houses. There were excavations</seg><seg type="columnLine">among many of the ruins, showing how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">present inhabitants had made effort to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secret and reap the abandoned spoil of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were two persons loitering among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buried houses, Gilbertson discovered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">other than the collection of children and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. Following him at some distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Chang Ssu-yeh, and in advance of him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unaware yet of his presence, was the Chi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nese woman of the desert. He caught up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her, and when she had overcome the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cultivated shyness of all Chinese women in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presence of men he told her the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief's decree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first she looked at him incredulously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with black eyes round and wide in surprise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then a pink flush spread under the delicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">olive of her skin and her eyes dropped with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her averted face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pretty tough for you, isn't it?" he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking in the classical language with</seg><seg type="columnLine">words that expressed as nearly as possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terseness of the Anglo-Saxon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked up quickly with an apprehen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive expression. Her features, more mobile</seg><seg type="columnLine">by far than those of any other Chinese</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman he had known, registered plainly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing alarm. With a start he understood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and returned rather evasively, her gaze that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was filled now with more than doubt--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze full of the tragic resignation that</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks the life and entombs the hopes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Orient's women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She thought:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The white man does not wish to marry</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. But I wish to marry him. He is bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter than these camel-drivers. I must kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself if he does not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thought:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By all the gods, Buddha, the woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't mind marrying me!

Chang Ssu-yeh will</seg><seg type="columnLine">see to that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three stood expectantly silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tomorrow?" asked Gilbertson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tomorrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbertson found it easier to decide if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked away from the fear in the woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It would be best to take a chance," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.

It had seemed a forlorn hope, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape, so closely were they under the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veillance of the curious villagers with whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">they lodged. Gilbertson had not found it</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy to slip away until long after midnight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then he could take with him little that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be of service on a long trip through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Winter desert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the woman it was still less easy, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she came pitifully unprepared for the jour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney, yet clutching fearfully in her wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeves a collection of cartridge-boxes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been her assigned task to find. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not let him relieve her of the burden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so Gilbertson put his arm about her slen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der shoulders as the best means of assisting</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. She looked up at him, startled, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she felt the pressure of the arm, then lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">her shyness in a breathless laugh. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be developing new characteristics</seg><seg type="columnLine">-- becoming a new creature -- here in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild freedom of the desert wastes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had reached the dunes and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">picking their way carefully eastward. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of each sand-eminence Gilbertson</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked for the light that should guide them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the waiting caravan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an hour they toiled on, the woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">weary feet lagging and demanding frequent</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest. She seemed to lean with more confi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence now upon his arm, and with a great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er abandon. He was keenly conscious of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, and it gave him a sense of proprietor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship commingled with a certain aggressive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">protective feeling less easy to name. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked down upon the knob of smooth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">black hair that came just to his shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now and then rested wearily but ca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ressingly against it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps he was a fool to be leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert oasis. For leaving there meant leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her, of course, though she was going with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. In the desert village it would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been impossible--the old chief's vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a house, a garden and in the midst of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman of mystery from the desert. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in the wide world--well, one must al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways be thinking of going home some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the remainder of one's days, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">can not go home with a Chinese wife. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he have a conscience he can not leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese wife--and the children.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There had been many women in Gilbert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's life, but they had been as ships that</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass in the night. He had boasted of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of susceptibility. So there was little</seg><seg type="columnLine">212</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">excuse for him when, as they saw the cara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">van light at last from the top of a sand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dune, he kissed the Chinese woman on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips and held her in an embrace to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she yielded wonderingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbertson discovered that a kiss elimi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nates a woman's creed, race and color, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves only sex. The spontaneity of his ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and the warmth of her response dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbed him, and he stood away from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost coldly. A dozen paces away he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chang, who had come out impatiently to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet them. Chang had watched them there</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the summit of the dune, outlined against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cold moon, and his lips framed unuttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mongol oaths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The camels went swaying into the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">and far into the day. There was no pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit. Apparently the villagers, robbed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their only successful means of combating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fugitives, had been content to swallow</seg><seg type="columnLine">their rage. The pill-doctor was lost to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, with his magic pellets, lack of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">might permit an early grave to enfold the</seg><seg type="columnLine">superstitious old chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At midday the camels were halted for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief rest and then urged onward wearily</seg><seg type="columnLine">till night. The men found water by dig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging, and Gilbertson saw that his old course</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have brought him to safety if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have held out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman came to him as Chang made</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp, and in a voice that had fear and elo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quence, gave him warning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will be careful, my master," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "He will kill you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nonsense -- Chang?" laughed Gilbert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she put a finger on her lips and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sorrowful rebuke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why should he kill me?" asked Gilbert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son more soberly. "All he wants is Zahid</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beg's wedding-money and the camels, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">an undisputed trail into Mongolia."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman looked at him pityingly, tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pering her impatience with fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chang interrupted them, and though Gil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bertson would not admit the thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">treachery on the part of the Mongol, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy to imagine the existence of a sinister</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard in the man's eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chang said something to the woman in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dialect Gilbertson did not understand, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she walked away with him. To Gilbertson</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was something in her attitude that</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested the cowering of a frightened child</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a blow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned away and strode a few paces</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the desert. A cold wind blew across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tops of the dunes and eddied into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gullies with mournful soughing. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thick haze over the horizon, and only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few stars near the zenith were visible. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness of the night was oppressive. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of the wind gave creepy suggestion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those evil spirits of old Ser Marco, calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unwary to destruction in the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">waste.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of a sudden Gilbertson recalled that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was totally unarmed. He had not even a</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife. He would not permit himself to fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack by the Mongol, yet he knew it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">folly for him to remain without means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">defense. Some weapon was necessary, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">not for his own security, at least for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the woman. Among the camp utensils</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seen a beautiful sharp-pointed knife,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one that might have been used for the flay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of wild camels. Of this knife he resolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">to possess himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbertson made his appearance some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what tardily at the meager evening meal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He gulped his tea and munched dried melon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rinds with a sort of nervous self-conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness that grew out of his furtive alertness</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a chance to purloin the coveted knife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was there, among the camp utensils,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming dully in the light of the fire. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">intensity of his desire for it had grown until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knife seemed to him now the most de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sired object in the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Chang, at the close of the meal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up the knife and casually slipped it</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his belt, Gilbertson could have shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rage. Then a feeling of the utmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">chagrin was succeeded by a sense of grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing indifference that bordered upon reck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessness. He startled his companions by</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing harshly, as he had done on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous occasion in the desert when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself in the hands of a similarly</seg><seg type="columnLine">callous fate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went to a sheltered gully to windward</seg><seg type="columnLine">of camp, where the drifted sand was soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">and deep, and wrapped himself in his sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-bag. What was the use of battling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate? If the Mongol meant to kill him he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do it, no doubt. What chance had</seg><seg type="columnLine">he against a man armed with a gun and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife? Perhaps he might wrest one or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other from him in personal encounter, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">could he, single-handed, hope to disarm the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man completely?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His mind hesitated a moment over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Woman of the Desert</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">213</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">possibility of stealing upon the Mongol as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he slept, then dismissed the thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chang had boasted of the fact that he slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his eyes half-open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strangely enough, Gilbertson slept as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">child sleeps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHANG lay in the lee of a camel</seg><seg type="columnLine">for warmth, the vileness of camel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">odor being in no sense a deterrent</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his hardened sensibilities. He fingered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knife at his belt, and opening the cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of the revolver saw that it was filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with cartridges. He placed no great reli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance in such affairs as this upon the gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact he had always looked with a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal of suspicion upon this invention of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreign devil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The knife--that was the thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tucking the revolver into the folds of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer garment he felt once more the keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the blade, then slipped it again into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his belt, lying back into the sand, waiting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The woman was becoming too fond of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreigner. He could see that in her eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was better that it should end at once.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There would be one less mouth to feed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was not too much food to last until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could get more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman, under her tiny tent of skins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay in an icy trembling. She had resolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sacrifice herself for the man--no uncom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon thing in a land whose literature and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tradition are most richly adorned by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heroic sacrifices of women, but one never-</seg><seg type="columnLine">theless to cause this one to tremble. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sort of sacrifice hundreds of thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of women have made in the East to the call</seg><seg type="columnLine">of filial piety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman's trembling ceased when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose and stole softly from the tent. A sil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ver crescent of moon etched dim outlines</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the desolate landscape. She made out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forms of the camels and went toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, very slowly, fearful even of the wraith</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shadow that followed her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the lee of the first camel lay the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">to whom she must give herself in an effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">to disarm him of that weapon which other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise would slay the foreigner. The white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man--this was all that caused her to hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tate, for she had no fear for herself--might</seg><seg type="columnLine">not understand. He might abandon her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even kill her, for what she was about to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These foreigners, she knew, had strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas concerning the value of a woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodily purity. Thus, success might mean</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">disaster equally as great as failure; yet she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was determined to possess herself of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon about which all life now seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman knelt swiftly at the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sleeping Mongol. Shudderingly she pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared to waken him with a caress of aban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">donment. She saw the gleam of his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">through thin slits between his eyelids, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered if he were awake. But his breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was regular; he was asleep--asleep with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes open, as he had so often boasted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her hesitation gave time for a discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">that startled her heart into a wild crescendo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From an opening in his cotton-padded outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">garment protruded the butt of the revolver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the movement of a cat poised for</seg><seg type="columnLine">recoil she touched it, closed her fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it, and, keeping her eyes upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, slowly pulled it forth. Primitive in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinct almost overpowered her. Rage welled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up within her breast as if in compensation</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her previous fear. Consciousness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">power made her exult in a desire to kill, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be revenged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She knew nothing of guns, but undoubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly could shoot him as he lay. Yet she</seg><seg type="columnLine">stole away, triumphantly, lightly, her soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a transport of exultation. It was a tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umph no less keen than if she had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">her sacrifice. Having desired and dared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacrifice, hers must still be the credit in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">own soul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is the man's place to kill," she mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered to herself as she stumbled through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand, carrying the weapon to Gilbertson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But her knees suddenly became unsteady,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beating of her heart oppressive. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">must rest awhile. Under the rude tent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">skins she held the gun to her cheek and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembled once more with weakness and fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chang, dreaming of his native Mongol</seg><seg type="columnLine">village, with wild flowers blooming in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide pastures and the Chinese woman of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desert by his side in the doorway of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">adobe hut, awoke suddenly and cursed him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self for having slept. It seemed to him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dream that the Chinese woman had</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn a knife from his belt and thrust it</seg><seg type="columnLine">feebly against his breast. He reached for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knife, now that he was awake, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reassured by the touch of the cold blade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had not intended to sleep. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be no sleep for him until the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was out of the way. Perhaps this</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be the best time.

He had no thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the distrusted revolver, but kept his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">caressingly upon the handle of the knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbertson awoke with a premonition so</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear and ghastly it left no doubt in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind as to the intent of the dark figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that bent menacingly over him. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stifled cry he sprang as the Mongol's knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell, and spoiled the aim of the blow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the strength he could command was</seg><seg type="columnLine">centered in a convulsive lurch toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chang's feet. He grappled them, and tug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ged with such a tempestuous fury that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mongol reeled and fell heavily backward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sleeping-blanket hampered the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's efforts to get to his feet and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mongol was up before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great weight of the man's body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunging fiercely at Gilbertson, carried him</seg><seg type="columnLine">helplessly into the sand, but he grasped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand that held the knife, and, holding it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mouth, tore savagely at the tendons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wrist with his teeth. No sound of agony</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from the Mongol, but taking the knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his left hand he plunged it swiftly, sure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, into the white man's side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman, in her tent, heard nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">save the wind that shrieked like an endless</seg><seg type="columnLine">troupe of demons over the crests of sand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When she had regained her strength she</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out toward the gully where Gilbert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son lay. She was in time to see the pitiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle that ended in a moan from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man and a quivering into helpless re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laxation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Chang stood up over his victim, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leer of barbaric satisfaction curling his Ups,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman confronted him. She could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have told how she managed it, but in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands the gun spoke, shaking the solitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the desert. Before the Mongol fell she</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot again, and then, standing over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet form she made the gun blaze vivid</seg><seg type="columnLine">paths of flame into his body until its cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber was empty and only successive empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">clicks answered the movement of her fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger on the trigger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VONG found them there in the early</seg><seg type="columnLine">forenoon, the woman in a ghastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">hysteria, the camel-drivers helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">with terror, and Gilbertson moaning in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood beside the body of the Mongol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great caravan of which Vong was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">member halted there all day, and camped</seg><seg type="columnLine">there at night, though it was far from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">water-hole. There were Chinese officials</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearing insignia of the court at Peking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the caravan, and a guard of soldiers from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hami. The officials looked upon it as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracle that the woman of whom they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come in search should have been found</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus. They weighed secretly, in anticipa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, the gold of their reward.

Our present</seg><seg type="columnLine">system of designating regiments merely by</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry, almost meaningless and undistinguish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing numbers is stupid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I know quite well that most of these regi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments will not materialize.

Same was mate, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather second mate and acting bos'un, on a handy</seg><seg type="columnLine">little three-sticker (a fore-and-after). Decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">join him on the trip. We were bound to West In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dies and Central American ports with a general</seg><seg type="columnLine">cargo. Outward bound, nothing happened. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel had very good qualities, a fast sailer, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper an exceptionally hard driver. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">only three men in the forecastle, myself included.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MOW, owing to harsh and unjust treatment, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived from the hands of German sailors dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing three years of apprenticeship, I simply never</seg><seg type="columnLine">can take to any of them kindly. But one of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be excepted. He came from the north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern part of Germany, somewhere up in Pomerania.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was of good family and seemed to be an alto-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gether different fellow from the rest that I had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal with before. To make my yam shorter, we be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came good mates, always recounting stories and</seg><seg type="columnLine">happenings from the old country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was pretty green as far as seamanship was</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned, never having been on any sailing vessel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I helped him out whenever possible and he soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was doing very well indeed. In fact, too well, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of a sudden he fell victim to that terrible sick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness called swelled-head, and became quite a person-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age. But he never said boo when it came to reef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing or making fast topsails in a squall. After his</seg><seg type="columnLine">first attack I left him all to himself, and even re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsed his later advances, as I now classed him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of the roundheads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AA/Ti CAME to Puerto Cortez (Spanish Hondu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ras) Christmas evening. The old man ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced us a couple of dollars. We rowed ashore to</seg><seg type="columnLine">celebrate in a dive run by a Frenchman. We got</seg><seg type="columnLine">hilarious and you know how it is when you have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grudge against some one. Sooner or later it will out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wine in a tropical country sets you simply boil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Don't know if it was a girl of that dive started</seg><seg type="columnLine">us off or what. Come to think now, it was some</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown Venus. He claimed that she favored him</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than me and we fools spent our $10 a mile a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute, just to please her, and got thrown out</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we were broke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside, we renewed the argument. He being a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong young man and I much smaller in propor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, he thought to do away quickly with me. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found out different. I found I had to finish him</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly and accordingly put all my strength and</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy in the assault and attacked him with a feroc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity that he had not expected. His style was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wrestler, mine both wrestling and boxing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T\TOW mind, at the time, the country down there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in a revolutionary state and martial law</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pronounced in Puerto Cortez. When I laid him</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with a right-arm-swing to the jaw, my senses</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared and I thought I had killed the man. I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have much time to find out, either, as a bunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of native soldiers laid hold of me and we went in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction of the main part of the town. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">realization came quick, and all the remorseful</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts of my action with it. I decided to escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">if possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How I got away, and how I got back to the ves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sel and away again, and how I had to hide from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers, in the swamps never before penetrated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men, alone would take a book to tell. I real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly don't know today how long I hid, but found my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self fever-crazed one morning on the beach, about</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty miles from port. I was literally cut to pieces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my whole body was swollen, as mosquitoes there</seg><seg type="columnLine">abound in real clouds. What a blessing that salt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">water bath was to me when I dragged myself on all</seg><seg type="columnLine">fours down to the water's edge! You can not</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine unless you have experienced something like it</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T-TOW I got along and acquainted myself with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the natives would make interesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading. To come back to my subject: Way out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swamps I lived unknown to any, outside of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinaman and one black fellow. He was a deform-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed Hercules, the most hideous being you could</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine. He supplied me every month with food</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the town. We both were partners in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">220</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">swamps where we gained a precarious existence by</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning blue mango wood and making charcoal (al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most any woman in that country uses same). Also</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering palm-kernels, stealing and marauding</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon plantations (only fruits), which the negro then</seg><seg type="columnLine">sold in Puerto Cortez to traders and in the public</seg><seg type="columnLine">market. Never did get much more out of it than</seg><seg type="columnLine">my grub, as he usually came home drunk, half of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the goods lost or stolen, and in a very bad frame of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. On those occasions had to defend myself for</seg><seg type="columnLine">life at times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Went almost crazy with the heat, then the rainy</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather arrived, and I got spells of fever again. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only medicine I had was a grass which grows there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a sour taste, has very long leaves, and is used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make tea for those stricken with fever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">QME day, during Grant's absence (he called</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself Grant), I decided to do something--</seg><seg type="columnLine">get some books, at least, as I could endure it no long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er to lay in our Mannaka shack day and night--</seg><seg type="columnLine">think and think. Got out to the beach (we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">camped some miles away, in the forest swamp), and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made my way along the same slowly. Came across</seg><seg type="columnLine">some natives (same are mostly mixed breeds, In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dians, blacks, Spanish and Chinese), who gave me</seg><seg type="columnLine">a willing ride in their canoe for the day. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">camped at night somewhere along the beach, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">next morning I left them to make my way by boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they told me there was a ranch run by an Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ican not far distant.

Of men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">write in the Camp-Fire and men who are more or</seg><seg type="columnLine">less eaten up by the Wanderlust and who have seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">both sides of life. The more I studied over this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, the more I became convinced that, many</seg><seg type="columnLine">such men who are now unknown to each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">could, by some symbol, be made aware of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindred nature of the other and probably find enjoy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and solace in each other's company.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'T'HEN arose the thought: Why not a Brother-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood of some description?

I was riding pretty fast for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearest town I could find, as I had been out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">grub for a day and a half, and I was a hungry hombre.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My horse stepped into a dog-hole, breaking his leg.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shot the poor devil, and started to foot it. Still</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward town, as my stomach was about ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sue me for non-support.

I headed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way and found it was a freight. I flagged it down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked to the caboose, and took a good American</seg><seg type="columnLine">sassing for being a good-for-nothing cow-puncher</seg><seg type="columnLine">bumming a ride. Anyway, this said hombre invited</seg><seg type="columnLine">me into the caboose, cooked me up one meal, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then another one. He and two Mexicans were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew. After he had seen me putting that grub away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said he would take that back about me being</seg><seg type="columnLine">good for nothing, as I sure could eat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We both rolled a cigarette, when I saw a copy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Adventure under the bench.

I showed him my identifica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion-card. Then we shook hands; we were brothers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Camp-Fire. I told him about my saddle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack. He stopped the train while the Greasers got</seg><seg type="columnLine">it for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HTHERE is where the idea hit me. Why not</seg><seg type="columnLine">organize the Camp-Fire? Make it a body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its own.
