                    Horatia, so that her own son, the puppet Gisdel, may rule. Bistoff, secretly loyal to Maldio, only drugs him and later revives and rescues him from the tomb, along with Dugdale, an
                    English secret agent, buried alive for claiming Maldio was not really dead. Maldio, demanding a respite from kingly cares before claiming his throne, goes to England and secretly
                    marries Loti, the girl he loves, his identity being known only to her. Meanwhile Gisdel has become infatuated with Caroline de L'Isle, ail actress, thereby enraging his mother. The
                    Queen discovers the tomb is empty, suspects Bistoff and sends Zavair to summon him. Bistoff makes excuses. Zavair reports having seen Dugdale alive at Bistoff's home.</ab>
