This is the famous Ro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">setta stone, a heavy piece of basalt, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this ancient monument gave the clew to</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the ancient Eyptian words. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the inscriptions was in what is called</seg><seg type="columnLine">the demotic character, which had lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">or outlived the pictorial hieroglyphics.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Other such monuments have been found,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which have helped in the difficult work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A number of students investigated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject, among others Thomas Young,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the most famous physicists of old</seg><seg type="columnLine">times, celebrated for his work on the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dulatory theory of light and on the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terference of light waves.

Yet in his archaeological work he</seg><seg type="columnLine">only discovered four letters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Egyptians made great use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">seals. These were made out of stone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">often in the shape of beetles and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">design or seal was engraved on the flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">base under the carving of the body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insect. These were hieroglyphs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rubbed over with coloring matter they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were used as our rubber stamps are to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day.

Here the Egyptians really</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be ahead of us, as it is fair to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that this is the first attempt at</seg><seg type="columnLine">printing from a cylinder, and to-day cyl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inder printing presses turn out newspa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers at the rate of many thousands per</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hour from a single complicated machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would seem that the cylindrical seal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Egyptians could be modified so</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to be used for rubber stamps.

This is a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">reed which grows to a height of ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and whose interior consists of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very strong pith. Centuries before it</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred to anybody to make paper, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">pith used to be divided by cutting into</seg><seg type="columnLine">very thin slices, which were placed to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, the sides having been cut very</seg><seg type="columnLine">true, so as to give a very close joint</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were crossed by other strips</seg><seg type="columnLine">similarly cut, so that the finished product</seg><seg type="columnLine">was two layers thick. How they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">made to adhere is not perfectly clear--</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether there was some mucilaginous or</seg><seg type="columnLine">other adhesive natural sap in them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which held them together, or whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">some additional adhesive was used, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stems as thick as a man's arm at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the base, are triangular with an outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell or bark. Within is the pith. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">is white and very strong. It can be cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">into slices of various thicknesses as de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sired. So strong is it that boats can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">built with it. Moses' mother, Jochebed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her despair at the legally imposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaughter of the male children of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hebrews, put the infant Moses into</seg><seg type="columnLine">what has been called an "arc of bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushes," which was a little box made of</seg><seg type="columnLine">papyrus, and set the little creature adrift</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Nile. We read of larger papyrus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">built craft, but this little vessel carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">a more impressive load than any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The area, where it was cultivated was</seg><seg type="columnLine">much larger than the region it now grows</seg><seg type="columnLine">in.

From these, by careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">treatment and straightening, papyri</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been recovered. Papyrus has also</seg><seg type="columnLine">been found in Herculaneum, as rolled-up</seg><seg type="columnLine">documents, charred in the destruction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city, which have been unrolled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">preserved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The world to-day, is developing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mania for collecting.

And now comes the sad</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of all this. Papyrus was very en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">during, far more so than our modern</seg><seg type="columnLine">news-press paper, and buried in ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground in Egypt and elsewhere, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were quantities of papyrus manuscripts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were well worth the attention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world. It is hard to believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not until the year 1870 or there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abouts that collectors of the highest</seg><seg type="columnLine">class and students of Egyptology and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient literature including Greek and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Latin, awoke to the fact that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were quantities of papyri still to be had</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a good state of preservation although</seg><seg type="columnLine">centuries old. They were perhaps buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ruins of a building and after pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ervation for twenty centuries or more</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rapidly disappearing, not by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces of nature, but by the ignorance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Thus we are told of one instance</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a number of papyri were found</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the ignorant Arabs in a compact roll,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they amused themselves by burning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">them on account of what they thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the pleasant odor which they pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced, and of the entire roll one was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunately saved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The searching for papyri is now be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing systematically conducted by scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">organizations.

It w'ould be interest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, if it could be written into the record,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these six were powerful but corrupt</seg><seg type="columnLine">politicians, that they were the recipients</seg><seg type="columnLine">of large sums from the racketeers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">underworld, that they saw in the serum</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Biddle the destruction of all forms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vice. But such was not the case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The six men were clean-cut, respec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, hard-headed business men, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered political office simply as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary adjunct to their business. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the majority stockholders in some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the largest corporations in the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States, and their main interests were life</seg><seg type="columnLine">insurance, accident insurance, drug man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ufacturing, bonding, hospitals, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher education of the youth of Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ica. One of them was the president of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large university.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The reason for the meeting was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much disbelief in the experiments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Biddle but too great a belief. They saw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps more clearly than any other six</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in America, what the general use</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his serum would result in. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat around a table with their coats off</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their shirt sleeves rolled up. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to think.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The university man started the discus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will imagine that I represent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher education, not only of one uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versity, but of the nation. The income</seg><seg type="columnLine">on our endowments pays much of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">expenses. That money is invested mainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in life insurance companies and rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads. The railroads have been hard hit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the life insurance companies collapse,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">every college in America will have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">close. There would hardly be enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">money to pay the janitors, let alone the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professors. I am not going to do your</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking for you, but I am going to ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of you to imagine what effect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">general use of the Biddle Serum will</seg><seg type="columnLine">have on the business of the life insur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance companies! Also the companies who</seg><seg type="columnLine">are doing accident insurance!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And here is the second thing I ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to think about. What two depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of every university are the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">attended, after the plain A.B. or B.S.</seg><seg type="columnLine">groups? The answer is law and medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cine. Why do our young men study</seg><seg type="columnLine">law and medicine? Because they expect</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make a living. Now, one more ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Suppose the Biddle serum works</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way the inventor thinks it will?</seg><seg type="columnLine">What will happen to the practice of</seg><seg type="columnLine">law and medicine?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not like to admit it, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">practice of law depends on the weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesses of men's souls and the practice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of medicine depends on the weaknesses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their bodies. That must be evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all of us. There are over one hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred and twenty-five million persons in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States and every day mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions of them break some law and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have the help of lawyers, and every</seg><seg type="columnLine">day millions of them break some law</seg><seg type="columnLine">of health and have to appeal to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">medical profession. I tell you that thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">days after the Biddle Serum is given to</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of these people the income of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">two professions will cease and the law-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yers and doctors will be on the streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">selling apples and holding out the tincups</seg><seg type="columnLine">for sweet charity. No one will want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a student of these professions. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">law and medical schools will close their</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors. Who will want to study medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cine for ten years, at a cost of fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars, when any disease can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be cured by a single injection of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple serum that can be made by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">barrel by any manufacturing chemist!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The millions invested in our hospitals</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not yield one cent of income; every</seg><seg type="columnLine">drug company in America will go out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of business over night.

Reaching the rostrum, the dog sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and looked up at his master and</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog wagged his tail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Y friends," began the Montana</seg><seg type="columnLine">Senator.

I have been in</seg><seg type="columnLine">conference with the leaders of both Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">publican and Democratic parties, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they assure me that action will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken as rapidly as is consistent with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rules of our respective bodies.

I think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he discovered that he was no longer a</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessity in my life, he would die of</seg><seg type="columnLine">grief. Some weeks ago I received an</seg><seg type="columnLine">injection of the Biddle serum. I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered my sight, and now have perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision. It may have been a coincidence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I feel that the serum gave me some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing I was sure I could never have.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But in gaining my sight I saw that I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">might cause my little friend much suffer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. He is growing old and will soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">die. For the little while he lives I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to pretend I am still blind.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">President was there, a stenographer, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one representative of the press.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The physicians had been carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">selected by the American Medical Asso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciation. Each was a specialist, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, in addition to being a physician, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted chemist. After introductions Bid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle began his explanation of the serum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He talked at length concerning the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">celled animal, showed how man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply a collection of such cells. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">called their attention to the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">under favorable circumstances the</seg><seg type="columnLine">isolated cell could live indefinitely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereas, in large masses, as in the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man, they rapidly died, could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">reproduce, starved from lack of proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">nourishment and .ultimately produced</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a poisoning of the system that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire mass died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He explained that his thought, years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago, had been to improve the circulation</seg><seg type="columnLine">in such a way that the individual cell</seg><seg type="columnLine">would live longer. Later he found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the cell was a mass of energy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of providing life indefinitely if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it could be liberated. He was not sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">what this energy was; it might be some</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of radiant vibration, it might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy obtained from the splitting Qf the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydrogen atom. He had worked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some years on the probleril of the re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lease of this energy, and had finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved it. Even in the solution he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much in the dark. He simply knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the injection of a certain serum or</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution of chemicals gave an extra</seg><seg type="columnLine">function to the individual cell and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abled it to release this energy just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well when it was in combination with</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions of cells of the human body, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it could when it was isolated and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tached from all others</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even there he was in doubt as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether he was simply restoring a lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">power to the cell or giving it a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had experimented with this solu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion on many forms of multicellular life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In all instances the effect was the same.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It made a sick plant or animal well. Five</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago he had started to experiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sick mammals and had cured vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous diseases. His work with the higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">apes had been most interesting. At last</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had felt justified in beginning his</seg><seg type="columnLine">work with the human animal. The re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sults had been identical with those he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen in the lower types of animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was more and more clear to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he explained, that all conduct that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">selfish and anti-social was simply the</seg><seg type="columnLine">result of sickness. He hoped that future</seg><seg type="columnLine">work with the serum would make this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought a definite scientific fact. If it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were true, then all sin and evil in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world could be wiped out, and man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">following the Golden Rule, would leap</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward toward the stars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In his work with animals he felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been able to prolong life. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">Would have to be considered. At pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent all that could be said was that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectancy of life would be increased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How much would be added to the span</seg><seg type="columnLine">of human existence would have to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined by years of observation. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">question of a second dose would also</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to be experimented with. Person-</seg><seg type="columnLine">LIFE EVERLASTING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, he felt that the maximum result</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be obtained from one dose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten cubic centimeters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hoped that there would be an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">provement in the intelligence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation. He was sure there would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">some advance. Certain of the convicts</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shown a remarkable increase in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">intellectual quotient. That result also</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to be studied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, even if nothing more resulted than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the improvement of the physical health</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the nation, it would be worth while.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He advised that the serum be made in at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least a dozen laboratories and distributed</seg><seg type="columnLine">free to every reputable physician. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood that the Serum Bill would</seg><seg type="columnLine">provide for pensioning the medical pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fession in return for their services. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">would need some pension as, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire population was treated, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be little or no work for either</seg><seg type="columnLine">physician or surgeon, except in accident</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases. Even in severe accidents a dose</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the serum would perhaps cure with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out an operation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ended by giving the compostion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the serum and the manner of its prep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aration. It was not a true serum, but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather, a watery compond of certain well</seg><seg type="columnLine">known chemicals. He had called it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">serum because that name was best ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preciated by the laity. When he fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished he asked the chemist if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood and would be able to make it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Understand? Make it?" asked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemist. "Why, it is so simple that</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone could follow the directions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it. It is too simple. I wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">why no one thought of it before?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">COLUMBUS and the egg," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked the President. "And now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentlemen, have any of you any ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions to ask Mr. Biddle? He is very</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to leave the city."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How about the diet?"' asked one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anything at all, but the person will</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat less and less food and drink more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more water.

Then began a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certed drive to force the remaining one</seg><seg type="columnLine">percent to fall into line and to receive</seg><seg type="columnLine">their serum. The work now was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderably slower, but, at the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second year, it was thought that every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one in the United States had been pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected against disease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Biddle Serum Bill provided for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Committee of Scientists who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make constant observations on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficacy of the new drug and from time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to time were to report to the President</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the United States and his Cabinet</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerning the changes resulting in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">social, economic, and hygienic life of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. It was provided in the bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the first report be made one year</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the serum had been given to every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. Thus, the first report was made</seg><seg type="columnLine">three years following the giving of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first serum after the passage of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Biddle was supposed to be a member</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that committee, but Biddle had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared. No one had the remotest idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of where he was. Certain questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been asked him had it been</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to do so. The thinkers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation were beginning to wonder. Other</seg><seg type="columnLine">factors were forcing their way into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental life of the nation, results of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">serum, that no one had foreseen clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the months when the nation had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become free from disease. These prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lems had to be faced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the first place, the death rate had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped to a vanishing point. Except</seg><seg type="columnLine">in cases of destructive accident people</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ceased to die. The senile had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">juvenated to a healthy middle age, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young appeared to grow no older and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the infants and adolescents simply con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued to make the normal growth for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their age. But no one died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That fact, in itself, was not a cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">for instant alarm. It was considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that finally the effect of the serum would</seg><seg type="columnLine">wear out and that death again would</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear as a friendly enemy of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">human race. Perhaps old age could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">deferred by repeated doses of the serum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but eventually the human organism</seg><seg type="columnLine">would wear out and man would die,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe of no special disease, but simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a weariness of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the thing that was startling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little difficult to explain was the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the birth rate was as rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">diminishing as was the death rate. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a while after the giving of the serum</seg><seg type="columnLine">babies had been born, but as the months</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed there were fewer of them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the thirty-third to the thirty-sixth</seg><seg type="columnLine">month of the experiment there was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single birth reported in the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States. There were still lots of</seg><seg type="columnLine">little children, growing up, beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">little bronzed darlings, learning to walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and talk and do things, but there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no additional babies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What did it mean? Was the cessation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of death to be compensated for by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessation of new life? Had Biddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">known this?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The third factor that was causing in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest was the increasing efforts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">human race to entertain itself. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">long hours of leisure had to be filled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some way. Healthy, vigorous, active</seg><seg type="columnLine">men refused to become idlers simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">because they were not driven to effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the spur of necessity. The dominance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of production by machine power was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to pall. Mankind began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">use their hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SOCIAL life became fuller and physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally richer. With the increase of</seg><seg type="columnLine">health and wealth and leisure there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">30</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">greater opportunities for marriage. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no longer necessary to wait till</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man was thirty or more for him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry. Fewer women worked and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoted themselves to, the cultivation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">happiness. A life free of illness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">child-care made marriage an entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">different factor in the life of the human</seg><seg type="columnLine">race than it had been in the pre-serum</seg><seg type="columnLine">years. One philosopher said that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its jobs had been amplified and</seg><seg type="columnLine">elaborated and all of its sorrows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">burdens minimized to the point of dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance. It seemed that the human</seg><seg type="columnLine">race was experiencing the co-relation</seg><seg type="columnLine">and contacts of angels rather than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere union of animals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All these facts should have gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">far to prolong the individual marriage</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cause divorce to disappear as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">social process. To the astonishment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the students of human behavior, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">result did not follow. The percentage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of divorce increased in direct propor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to the decrease in the death rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the cessation of childbirth. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was burden-free, everybody was</seg><seg type="columnLine">married, but nearly everyone divorced</seg><seg type="columnLine">his or her mate and tried again to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a more favorable and happier union.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It really did not make much difference</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a woman who her husband was, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">long as she had one. All men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">much alike, all healthy, industrious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigorous and happily kind. All women</seg><seg type="columnLine">were beautiful, intelligent and true to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their husbands of the month. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body acted in a gentlemanly and lady-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like manner, but the opposite sexes</seg><seg type="columnLine">just did not seem to be able to live to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether for any length of time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the reason was not hard to find.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The family had disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Husband and wife remained as ever,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but children had disappeared from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In married life there was no cement-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVII</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hiram Smith Takes a Trip</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Purple Flash, more than any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other newspaper, had profited by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the changing social conditions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the first, under the insistent urging</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its secret owner, Hiram Smith, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one time -Wolf of Wall Street, it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the leading proponent of the neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sity of the world's rapidly adjusting it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to the new order of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a tabloid, it had ceased to exist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pabulum on which the tabloid pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lications fed, which made possible the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest, fleeting and infantile, of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">adenoid moron, was now a thing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past. Gone were the days of murder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scandal and disclosures of gross im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morality. These conditions ceased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">exist with all other diseases. Of all pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lishers Smith was the first to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">handwriting on the wall and the need</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a radical change. His daily was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now called The Rosey Daunt, a name</seg><seg type="columnLine">strikingly symbolic and suggestive of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new era. It had become a paper for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intelligentsia, the editorials of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">appealed only to the best interests of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smith saw, with ever increasing in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest and a growing concern, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">changes in the emotional life of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. Most people simply felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">increasing comfort and happiness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cared little for the profound biological</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances back of those changes. Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">was interested. He was not sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all was well with the new cultural pat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tern of life. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wanted to talk things over with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Biddle. But Biddle was gone. Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought about it for one day, talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">it over with his wife for another day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then issued his order. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short command of three syllables,</seg><seg type="columnLine">find biddle!!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As that order had back of it over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">LIFE EVERLASTING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">31</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred million dollars there could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt that Hiram Smith was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Six months and five million were</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent in the search and there was noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to show for it except failure. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Sally Fanning, who, with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">womanly intuition, supplied the neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary clue. She reminded Smith that</seg><seg type="columnLine">at one time Biddle had used the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Harry Ackerman. Was it possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had reverted to the use of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">name? So, Smith issued another order,</seg><seg type="columnLine">FIND HARRY ACKERMAN1.!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that order brought results.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hiram took the night plane to Quebec,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the first boat out of there for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicoutimi. He had to go down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">St. Lawrence River and up the Sague-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nay River. On the little steamer</seg><seg type="columnLine">chugged between high, precipitous cliffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Laurentian granite, till at last, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet above them, to the left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw a Madonna, holding in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms the Christ Child. Made out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood, painted white and eighty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">high, it seemed little larger than a child</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the river below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on to the next landing on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left," Smith told the Captain, "and let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me off there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not think there is anyone liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing there now," protested the Captain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Better go on to Chicoutimi."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. I know what I am doing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, he got off at the next landing.

He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">his best to be polite and tried to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">seats for all of his visitors.

The sail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ors were placed at the foot of the ram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">part, with orders to defend the breaches</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the last.

The bushman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, posted on a projection of rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard sounds which gradually became</seg><seg type="columnLine">more distinct. He was not mistaken;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Makololos were at length commenc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their assault on the mountain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Until ten o'clock the assailants did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not move; their fires were extinguished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and camp and plain were alike wrapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in obscurity. Suddenly Mokoum saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows moving up the mountain, till</seg><seg type="columnLine">the besiegers seemed but a few hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet from the plateau on which stood the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Now, then, quick and ready!" cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mokoum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The garrison immediately advanced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the south side of the fort, and opened a</seg><seg type="columnLine">running fire on the assailants. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Makololos answered by a war cry, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in spite of the firing, continued to ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vance. In the light caused by the flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the guns, the Europeans perceived</seg><seg type="columnLine">such swarms of natives that any resis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance seemed impossible. But still they</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusted that their well-directed balls were</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing considerable execution, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">discerned that not a few of the natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rolling down the sides of the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain. Hitherto, however, nothing ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested them. With savage cries they</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to press on in compact order,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without even waiting to hurl a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">assegai. Colonel Everest put himself at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head of his little troop, who seconded</seg><seg type="columnLine">him admirably, not excepting Palander,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who probably was handling a gun for al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most the first time. Sir John, now on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one rock now on another, sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">kneeling, sometimes lying, did wonders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his gun, heated with the rapidity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the repeated loading, began to burn his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. Mokoum, as ever, was patient,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bold, undaunted in his confidence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But the valor and precision of the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sieged could avail nothing against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torrent of numbers. Where one native</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fell, he was replaced by twenty more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, after a somewhat prolonged opposi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, Colonel Everest felt that he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be overpowered. Not only did the na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives swarm up the south slope of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain, but they made an ascent also</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the side slopes. They did not hes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itate to use the dead bodies of the fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">as stepping stones, and then even lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">them up, and sheltered themselves behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, as they mounted. The scene re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed by the flash of the firearms was</seg><seg type="columnLine">appalling, and the Europeans saw enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make them fully aware that they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect no quarter, and that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being assaulted by barbarians as savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">as tigers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At half-past ten the foremost natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reached the plateau. The besieged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were still uninjured (the natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet having employed their bows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">assegais), were thoroughly conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were impotent to carry on a combat</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to hand. The Colonel in a calm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear voice that could be heard above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tumult, gave the order to retire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a last discharge the little band</seg><seg type="columnLine">withdrew behind the walls. Loud cries</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted their retTeat, and the natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately made a nearer approach in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their attempt to scale the central breach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A strange and unlooked for recep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion awaited them. Suddenly at first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and subsequently repeated at intervals of</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a few minutes, there was a growling</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverberation as of rolling thunder. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinister sound was the report of the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploding mitrailleuse, which Sir John</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been prepared to employ, and now-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked with all his energy. Its twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five muzzles spread over a wide range,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the balls, continually supplied by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-feeding arrangement, fell like hail</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the assailants. The natives, swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at each discharge, responded at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first with a howl and then with a harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less shower of arrows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She plays well," said the bushman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEASURING A MERIDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching Sir John. "When you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">played your tune, let me play mine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was no need for Sir John</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be relieved; the mitrailleuse was soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent. The Makololos were struck with</seg><seg type="columnLine">consternation, and had sought shelter</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the torrent of bullets, having re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired under the flanks of the fort, leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the plateau strewn with numbers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In this instant of respite the Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Strux regained the donjon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, collecting themselves in compos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure as complete as if they were under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dome of an observatory, they , kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">a constant eye upon their telescope, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scanned the peak of Volquiria. When,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a short period of rest, the yells of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Makalolos made them aware that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the combat was renewed, they only per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">severed in their determination, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved that they would alternately re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main to guard their invaluable instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The combat, in truth, had been re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">newed. The range of the mitrailleuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">was inadequate to reach all the natives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who, uttering their cries of mortal ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geance, rallied again, and swarmed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">every opening. The besieged, protected</seg><seg type="columnLine">by their firearms, defended the breaches</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot by foot; they had only received a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few scratches from the points of the as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">segais, and were able to continue the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight for half an hour with unabated</seg><seg type="columnLine">ardor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toward half-past eleven, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colonel was in the thick of the fray, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle of an angry fusillade, Mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thew Strux appeared at his side. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye was wild and radiant; an arrow had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just pierced his hat and quivered above</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The signal! the signal!" he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The colonel was incredulous, but as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certaining the correctness of the welcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">announcement, discharged his rifle for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last time, and with an exuberant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shout of rejoicing, rushed toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">donjon, followed by the intrepid col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">league. There, kneeling down, he put</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eye to the telescope, and perceived</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the utmost delight the signal, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">long delayed and yet so patiently ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was truly a marvelous sight to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">these two astronomers work during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumult of the conflict. The natives had</seg><seg type="columnLine">by their numbers forced the enclosure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">antf Sir John and the bushman were</seg><seg type="columnLine">contending for every step. The Euro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peans fought with their balls and hatch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ets, while the Makololos responded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their arrows and assegais.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile the Colonel and Strux in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tently continued their observations, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palander, equally composed, noted down</seg><seg type="columnLine">their oft repeated readings. More than</seg><seg type="columnLine">once an arrow grazed their head, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke against the inner wall of the don-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jon. But their eye was ever fixed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal, and reading the indications of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vernier, they incessantly verified each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other's calculations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only once more," said Strux, slid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the telescope along the graduated</seg><seg type="columnLine">scale. An instant later, and it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been too late for any observations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the direction of the light was cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culated to the minutest fraction of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second; and at that very instant an enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous stone, hurled by a native, sent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">register flying from Palander's hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smashed the repeating circle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They must now fly in order to save</seg><seg type="columnLine">the result which they obtained at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost of such continuous labor. The na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives had already penetrated the case-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate, and might be at any moment ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear in the donjon. The Colonel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his colleagues caught up their guns, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palander his precious register, and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped through one of the breaches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their several companions, some slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded, were ready to cover their re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treat, but just as they were about to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">46</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">scend the north side of the mountain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strux remembered that they had failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kindle the signal. In fact, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">completion of the survey, it was neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary that the two astronomers on Mount</seg><seg type="columnLine">Volquiria should in their turn observe</seg><seg type="columnLine">the summit of Mount Scorzef, and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtless anxiously expecting the an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swering light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Colonel recognized the imperative</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessity for yet one more effort, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whilst his companions, with almost su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhuman energy, repulsed the natives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he re-entered the donjon. This donjon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was formed of an intricate frame work</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dry wood, which would readily ignite</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the application of a flame. The Col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onel set it alight with the discharge from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the muzzle of his gun, and, rushing out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rejoined his companions. In a few mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, rolling their mitrailleuse before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, the Europeans under a shower of</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows and various missies, were de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scending the mountain, and, driving back</seg><seg type="columnLine">the natives with a deadly fire, reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steamboat. The engineer, according</seg><seg type="columnLine">to orders, had kept up the steam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mooring was cast off, the screw</seg><seg type="columnLine">set in motion, and the Queen and Czar</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced rapidly over the dark and quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters. They were shortly far enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to see the summit of the mountain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The donjon was blazing like a beacon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its light would be easily discerned</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the peak of Volquiria.

Palander employed him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in rectifying and adjusting the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sults of the latest observations, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mokoum and Sir John hunted most</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigorously over the fertile, well-watered</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, abounding in game, with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Englishman would have been de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted, had it been in his power, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete a purchase, on behalf of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">British government. Three days after,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the 8th of March, some gun-shots</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced the arrival of the remainder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the party for whom they tarried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emery. Zorn, the two sailors, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pioneer, were all in perfect health. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">theodolite, the only instrument remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEASURING A MERIDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">47</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Commission, was safe. The young</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomers and their companions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">received with joyous congratulations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a few words they related that their</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey had not been devoid of diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culty. For two days they had lost their</seg><seg type="columnLine">way in the forests that skirted the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainous district, and with only the vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">indication of the compass they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never have reached Mount Volquiria,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it had not been for the shrewd in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligence of the pioneer. The ascent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mountain was rough, and the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay had caused the young astronomers</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much impatience as it had their col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leagues on Mount Scorzef. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully, by barometrical observations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculated that the summit of Volquiria</seg><seg type="columnLine">was 3,200 feet above the level of the sea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The light, increased by a strong reflector,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was first lighted on the night of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">4th; thus the observers on Mount</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scorzef had perceived it as soon as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared. Emery and Zorn had easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">discerned the intense fire caused by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning fortress, and with the theodolite</seg><seg type="columnLine">had completed the measurement of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">triangle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And did you determine the latitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the peak?" said the Colonel to Emery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, most accurately," replied Em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery; "we found it to be 19° 37' 35.337*."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, gentlemen," said the Colonel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"we may say that our task is ended. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have measured, by means of sixty-three</seg><seg type="columnLine">triangles, an arc of more than eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">degrees in length; and when we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigidly corrected our results, we shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">know the exact value of the degree, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">consequently of the meter in this part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the globe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A cheer of satisfaction could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">repressed amongst the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now," added the Colonel, "we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have only to descend the Zambesi in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to reach the Indian Ocean; is it</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so, Mr. Strux?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is," answered Strux, "but I think</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">we ought still to adopt some means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">testing our previous operations. Let us</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue our triangles until we find a</seg><seg type="columnLine">place suitable for the direct measure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of a base. The agreement between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lengths of the base, obtainind by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculations and by the direct measure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, will alone tell what degree of ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curacy we ought to attribute to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">observations."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strux's proposition was unanimousl)</seg><seg type="columnLine">adopted. It was agreed to construct a</seg><seg type="columnLine">series of subsidiary triangles until a site</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be measured with the measuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods. The steamboat, descending the af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluents of the Zambesi, was to await the</seg><seg type="columnLine">travelers below the celebrated Victoria</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falls. Everything being arranged the,</seg><seg type="columnLine">little troop, with the exception of four</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailors on board the Queen and Czar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">started the next day at sunrise. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">stations had been chosen to the east</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the angles measured, and, along</seg><seg type="columnLine">this favorable country, they hoped easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accomplish their auxiliary series. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushman had adroitly caught a quagga,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which, willing or unwilling, he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a beast of burden to carry the theodolite,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the measuring-rods, and some other lug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gage of the caravan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The journey proceeded rapidly. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">undulating country afforded many points</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sight for the small accessory triangles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The weather was fine, and it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">needful to have recourse to nocturnal</seg><seg type="columnLine">observations. The travelers could near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly always find shelter in the woods, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides, the heat was not insufferable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since some vapors arose from the pools</seg><seg type="columnLine">and streams which tempered the sun's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays. Every want was supplied by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunters, and there was no longer any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to be feared from the natives, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be more to the south of Lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ngami.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Matthew Strux and the Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have forgotten all their per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal rivalry, and although there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">48</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">no close intimacy between them, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on the most perfect terms of cour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tesy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Day after day, during a period of</seg><seg type="columnLine">three weeks, the observations steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded. For the measurement of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">base the astronomers required a tract of</seg><seg type="columnLine">land that should be level for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles, and the very undulations of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil that were desirable for the establish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of points of sight were unfavorable</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that observation. They proceeded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the northeast, sometimes following the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right bank of Cnobi, one of the principal</seg><seg type="columnLine">tributaries of the Upper Zambesi, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to avoid Maketo, the chief settle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the Makololos. They had now</seg><seg type="columnLine">every reason to anticipate that their re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn would be happily accomplished, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no further natural obstacles would</seg><seg type="columnLine">occur, and they hoped that their diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culties were all at an end. The country</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they were traversing was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratively well known, and they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be far from the villages of the Zam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">besi which Livingstone had lately visited.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus they thought with reason that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most arduous part of their task was</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, when an incident, of which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">consequences might have been serious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost compromised the result of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole expedition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nicholas Palander was the hero, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather was near being the victim, of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The intrepid but thoughtless calcu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lator, unwarned by his escape from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crocodiles, had still the habit of with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing himself from his companions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In an open country there was no great</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger in this, but in woods Palander's</seg><seg type="columnLine">abstraction might lead to serious con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequences. Strux and the bushman gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him many warnings, and Palander,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though much astonished at what he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered an excess of prudence, promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">to conform to their wishes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the 27th, some hours had passed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> since Strux and Mokoum had seen any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of Palander. The little troop were</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling through thickets of low trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shrubs, extending as far as the hori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zon. It was important to keep together,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it would be difficult to discover the</seg><seg type="columnLine">track of any one lost in the wood. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing and fearing nothing, Palander,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been posted, pencil in one hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the register in the other, on the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">flank of the troop, was not long in dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When, toward four o'clock, Strux and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his companions found that Palander was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer with them, they became ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremely anxious. His former aberra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions were still fresh in their remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brance, and it was probably the ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stracted calculator alone by whom they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been forgotten. The march was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, and they all shouted in vain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bushman and the sailors dispersed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a quarter of a mile in each direction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating the bushes, trampling through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woods and long grass, firing off their</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns, but yet without success. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">became still more uneasy, especially Mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thew Strux, to whose anxiety was joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">an extreme irritation against his un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky colleague. This was not the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time that Palander had served them thus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if the Colonel had laid any blame</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him, Strux would not have known</seg><seg type="columnLine">what to say. Under the circumstances,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only thing to be done was to en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp in the wood, and begin a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful search.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Colonel and his companions had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just arranaged to place their camp near</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glade of considerable extent, when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry, unlike anything human, resounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">at some distance to the left. Almost im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately, running at full speed, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared Palander. His head was bare,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hair disheveled, and his clothes tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some parts, almost to rags. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions plied him with questions;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the unhappy man, with haggard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEASURING A MERIDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> distended eye, whose compressed nostrils</seg><seg type="columnLine">still further hindered his short, jerking</seg><seg type="columnLine">respiration, could not bring out a word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">What had happened? Wrhy had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandered away? And why did he ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear so terrified? At last, to their re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated questions, he gasped out, in al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most unintelligible accents, something</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the registers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The astronomers shuddered; the reg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isters, on which was inscribed every re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sult of their operations, and which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculator had never allowed out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession, even when asleep, these reg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isters were missing. No matter whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palander had lost them, or whether they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been stolen from him; they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, and all their labor was in vain!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While his companions, mutely terri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied, only looked at each other, Matthew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strux could no longer restrain his anger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He burst forth into all manner of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vective against the miserable creature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatening him with the displeasure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Russian government, and adding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if he did not suffer under the knout</seg><seg type="columnLine">he should linger out his life in Siberia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To all this Palander answered but by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a movement of the head; he seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquiesce in all these condemnations, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even thought the judgment would be too</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenient.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But perhaps he las been robbed,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the Colonel at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What matters?" cried Strux, beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself; "what business had he so far</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from us, after our continual</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True," replied Sir John, "but we</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to know whether he has lost the</seg><seg type="columnLine">registers or been robbed of them.

Palander revived at the sugges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion; he arranged his tattered clothes as</seg><seg type="columnLine">best he could, and having accepted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacket of one sailor and the hat of</seg><seg type="columnLine">another, declared himself ready to lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">his companions to the scene of his ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They all started off toward the west,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and passed the night and the ensuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">day without any favorable result. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">many places, by traces on the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the bark of the trees, the bushman</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the pioneer recognized unmistakable</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestiges of the baboons, of which Pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ander affirmed that he was sure he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen no less than ten. The party was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon on their track, and advanced with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the utmost precaution, the bushman af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">firming that he could only count 011 suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess in his search by taking the chacmas</seg><seg type="columnLine">by surprise, since they were sagacious</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals, such as could only be ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached by some device of secrecy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Early the following morning one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Russian sailors, who was somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front, perceived, if not the actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">thief, yet one of his associates. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">prudently returned to the little troop,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who came at once to a halt. The Euro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peans, who had resolved to obey Mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">koum in everything, awaited his instruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. The bushman begged them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain in quietness where they were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, taking Sir John and the pioneer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned toward the part of the wood al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready visited by the sailor, carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping under shelter of the trees and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushwood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a short time the bushman and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">two companions caught sight of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">chacma, and almost immediately of nine</seg><seg type="columnLine">or ten more, gamboling among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes. Crouching behind a tree, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">attentively watched the animals. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">short tails did not reach the ground, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their powerful muscles, sharp teeth, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed claws, rendered them formidable</seg><seg type="columnLine">even to the beasts of prey. These chac-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mas are the terror of the Boers, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields of corn and maize, and occasion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally whose habitations, are plundered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not one of the animals had as yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">espied the hunters, but they all con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued their sport, yelping and barking</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though they were great, ill-favored</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs. The important point for deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mination was, whether the actual pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loiner of the missing documents was</seg><seg type="columnLine">there.

The worthy astronomer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost beside himself in consternation at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his loss, and evidently thought it a ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of life or death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After marching with the frequent</seg><seg type="columnLine">halts which the policy of being unob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served suggested, and continuing to di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verge for half an hour, the bushman</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered that they might now fall back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He and his companions, each about</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty paces apart, advanced like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">troop of Pawnees on a war-trail, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a w'ord or gesture, avoiding even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least rustling in the branches. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bushman stopped; the rest instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed his example, and standing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fingers on the triggers of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns, were ready to raise them to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. The band of chacmas was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sight, they were already sensible of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some danger, and seemed on the look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. The great animal which had stolen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the registers had, to their fancy, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of being especially agitated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had been already recognized by Pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ander, who muttered something like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">imprecation between his teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chacma looked as if it was mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing signs to its companions; some fe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">males, with their young ones on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders, had collected in a group, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the males w'ent to and fro around them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The hunters still drew on, one and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping a steady eye direct toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ostensible thief.

Sir John broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into an exclamation of disgust, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly afterward fired. Ten reports</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed, three chacmas lay dead on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, and the rest, with a prodigious</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound, passed over the hunters' heads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The robber baboon alone remained;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it darted at the trunk of a sycamore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it climbed with amazing agility,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disappeared among the branches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The bushman, having keenly surveyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot, asserted that the registers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">there concealed, and fearing lest the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chacma should escape across the trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he calmly aimed and fired. The animal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'ounded in the leg, fell from branch</seg><seg type="columnLine">to branch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In one of its fore-claws it was seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to clutch the registers, which it had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the fork of the tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the sight, Palander, w'ith a leap</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that of a chamois, darted at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chacma, and a tremendous struggle en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sued. The cries of both man and beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">mingled in harsh and discordant strain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the hunters dared not take aim at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chacma for fear of wounding their</seg><seg type="columnLine">comrade. Strux, beside himself with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage, shouted again and again that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">should fire, and in his furious agitation</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would probably have done so, if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not been that he was accidentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a cartridge for his gun, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been already discharged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The combat continued; sometimes Pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ander, sometimes the chacma, was up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">permost.

At last the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushman, seizing a favorable moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a sudden dash, and killed the ape</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one blow of his hatchet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nicholas Palander, bleeding, exhausted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and insensible, was picked up by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">colleagues; in his last effort he had recap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured his registers, which he was found</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconsciously grasping to his bosom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The carcass of the chacma was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veyed with glee to the camp.

At</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time he was an altruist, but the mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive brain contained within his herculean</seg><seg type="columnLine">body became overworked. He had trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">with our own Internal Revenue Depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, that made a heavy income tax lien</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the Russian, Verensky. The tax</seg><seg type="columnLine">assessment developed into a battle that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingered in our supreme courts. To make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the story short, Verensky lost. Stub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bornly he refused to pay the amount in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volved, and the Revenue Department filed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lien against his immense holdings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally a part of the Russian's brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">air that we inhale into our lungs is full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of swiftly moving protons and electrons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let us imagine air one hundred degrees</seg><seg type="columnLine">below zero, Fahrenheit. In this condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion the atomic motions would be very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much more sluggish than they are in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air we are now breathing. Stretch our</seg><seg type="columnLine">imaginations a bit further and imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air so cold that electrons did not re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volve at all.

In fact, some helium atoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a speed of twenty-five miles per</seg><seg type="columnLine">second. A cannon ball goes up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air with tremendous force. It leaves the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth at the rate of less than a mile per</seg><seg type="columnLine">second, and then because of gravity, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns to earth. But if the cannon ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to be shot into the air with an initial</seg><seg type="columnLine">velocity of about seven miles per second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would never return.

Why do you say 'Cos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mos'? Don't you get it? Cosmic</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays!" Millstein's voice rose to a high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited pitch as he went on. "Cosmic</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays are considered by some scientists to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the signals sent out through the ether,</seg><seg type="columnLine">announcing the continuous creation Of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavier metals out of the lighter. Many</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago it was thought that cosmic rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">originated from the fierce energy of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, generated in that mighty globe of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas by the exploding atoms that provide</seg><seg type="columnLine">its boundless energy. Later it was found,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, when machines called electro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scopes were lowered into deep lakes, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cosmic rays still had their effect. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">62</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">machine was originally designed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous Dr. Robert A. Millikan. His ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus was composed of delicate quartz</seg><seg type="columnLine">fibers so arranged that when the fibers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were charged with one kind of electricity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would repel and remain apart, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as the cosmic rays influenced</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, penetrating the shell of the electro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope, the electrical charge of the fibers</seg><seg type="columnLine">was knocked off in proportion to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect of the rays, causing the quartz</seg><seg type="columnLine">fibers to come close together. Then, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">measuring the rate of the collapse of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fibers and the discharge of the electricity</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them, the great Millikan was able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prove the strength of cosmic rays at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any moment. He made the astounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover)' that these rays have the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect at night as in the daytime, thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">proving that the rays do not originate</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the mighty energy of the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Millikan also found out in his experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments that some rays were more pene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trating than others, which proved that</seg><seg type="columnLine">cosmic rays had different characteristics.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tests showed that some of these rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">could pass through seventeen feet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead. Owing to the research of the mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificent scientist, it was decided that cos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mic rays came from interstellar space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Later, with Millikan still laboring at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">devices, it was discovered that the cosmic</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays are divided very distinctly into sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral distinct bands or groups of the spec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trum. Then it was proven that each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spectrum bands of the cosmic rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">corresponds to the production of a par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular kind of atom, as when the atoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of helium gas are being built in sky space</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is released a definite band of cosmic</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays, called the helium cosmic ray bands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again, when an oxygen atom is being</seg><seg type="columnLine">made, another sort of cosmic ray is dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged. The generation of silicon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron atoms causes the emission of very</seg><seg type="columnLine">different and distinct ray bands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now nitrogen and carbon are so close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to oxygen in their atomic pattern, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">structure of their electrons within each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their atoms, that the cosmic rays, due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their atom building, are included in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen cosmic rays.

There was no place</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth I could make a safe test without</seg><seg type="columnLine">damaging too much surface."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well!" exclaimed Cromwell, wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed, "you have got a surprise for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falcon! I don't know what earth would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done the last ten years without your</seg><seg type="columnLine">talent. You've developed practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">every new weapon they have."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EVER mind the bouquets. I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell you about this weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">here," said Millstein, pointing to a device,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the controls of which were similar to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first. "This operates in practically the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same manner, except that I call it my</seg><seg type="columnLine">expansion ray. Wrhen its fearful energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">floods itself over any element, it causes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the orbits of the electrons within that</seg><seg type="columnLine">element to suddenly enlarge the circles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their orbits many million times. This, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, has the same effect as an explo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of T.N.T. Unfortunately, so far</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've been unable to affect anything but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the electrons within an iron nucleus, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course almost every metal in a space</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship has some iron in its composition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So if we can maneuver our projection</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes to bathe this ray over a space ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and explode all the billions of iron nuc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">leuses within that space ship, the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure is certain to fall apart."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But there are lots of elements used in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a space ship, such as copper, aluminum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead and others," argued Cromwell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"These have no iron in their composition."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," agreed Millstein, "but all those</seg><seg type="columnLine">elements are always fastened to steel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which has iron content. Think of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel shell of a space ship going to pieces."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're right. The expansion ray is</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to be tough for the enemy. Have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you any other nice little things up your</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeve?" ,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just two more," answered Millstein.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This third device, which points its pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jection tube similar to the others I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained, shoots out vibrations which</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel on a beam of light. When this</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam, carrying the deadly rays, strikes a</seg><seg type="columnLine">space ship, it has a powerful effect on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atomic structure of all elements. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know just how I discovered it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stumbled on it quite by accident, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">this ray, combined with the vibration, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly stops the orbits of electrons in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any element. This of course produces</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to absolute zero, and unless the oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupants of a space car had something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcome these rays, they would be frozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've been working lately.

I have managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">project it on a beam of light, and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning this other switch, I can produce</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vibrations all around our space ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but of course in using this latter method,</seg><seg type="columnLine">66</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the vibrations weaken very rapidly as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they widen into space.

Cromwell knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">even though Millstein was discoursing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific matters of a technical nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his keen brain was shrewdly analyz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and testing every theory relating to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the problem at hand. This was their tra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditional way of working together on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult problem.

It seemed to stimulate the scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tist's brain to give out information.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, Chief, in the laboratory the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, you spoke about photons. What are</seg><seg type="columnLine">photons ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Cromwell, I guess you've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">me cornered at last. I've said enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you about cosmic rays for one time, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">photons are closely associated with cosmic</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays, light and color. We scientists are</seg><seg type="columnLine">still groping at the bottom of a vast sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of yet undiscovered wonders. The sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plest way to put it would be to say that</seg><seg type="columnLine">photons, sometimes called "quanta," are</seg><seg type="columnLine">a series of light waves, consisting of</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless billions and billions of tiny bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lets of energy. Laboratory experiments</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VELOCITY OF ESCAPE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have proven that the difference between</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet and red color is in the number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">microscopic waves of light, which enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">your eyes in a second of time. If seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and fifty-six millions of millions</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter your eyes in a second, your nerves</seg><seg type="columnLine">are affected in such a way that you call</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sensation violet. These waves cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seen in a microscope. For your edifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation, my embryo scientist, the number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of waves per inch in each color in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rainbow has been counted. Fifty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand waves to the inch give us the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensation of blue. Forty-eight thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations, green; forty-four thousand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow; thirty-eight thousand, red. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waves become so long that less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">about thirty-three thousand occur, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be unable to see them. For exam-'</seg><seg type="columnLine">pie, alcohol flame does not send out waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">that can make any but a minute impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion on the nerves of the eyes. Invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">light also comes at the other extreme, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultra-violet, where the waves are so short</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crowded together they don't give our</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes any sensation at all. You can com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pare this to the piercing shrieks of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory apparatus, or some insects that</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce vibrations so shrill that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't affect our eardrums at all. If the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves of color are so short it takes over</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty-six thousand of them to make an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch, they are totally invisible to our eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and are called ultra-violet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thus it has been that scientists,</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching the void with their telescopes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been able to tell from the various</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors of the spectrum out in space just</seg><seg type="columnLine">how the cosmic rays are vibrating, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what particular element is being born in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cold spaces. Temperatures of the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">ind stars are thus readily determined,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for many colors invisible to the naked</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye can be detected and classified in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is doubtful whether Cromwell had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been listening to this technical discourse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly his body stiffened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">REAT SCOTT, Millstein!

Perhaps some</seg><seg type="columnLine">near celestial collision distorted them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spiral shapes; but unlike a whirlpool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stars are not moving toward the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter.

In fact the space suit was strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar to the cumbersome armor used by</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep sea divers. The metal part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit was made of an extremely light but</seg><seg type="columnLine">very tough metal. Its composition was</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar to the aluminum alloys of many</seg><seg type="columnLine">years past. The inside of the suit was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lined with gold-beaters skin. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange that these scientists of a super</seg><seg type="columnLine">age would go to nature for such a mate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rial, but the gold beaters skin was found</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be an excellent material to control</seg><seg type="columnLine">leakage. It is the outer membrane of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">large intestine of the ox.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The suit was provided with small</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic energizers to produce heat, for in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the absolute zero of space the occupant</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a space suit would freeze in an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless artificially warmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was with great difficulty that Mill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stein, in spite of his extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength, moved about when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">donned the suit. Just before screwing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the helmet, Cromwell made another</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnest plea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me go in your place, Chief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're too important to lose your life in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this fool stunt. The Falcon won't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">the difference. The space suit will dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guise me. Let me go out and cross swords</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the devil. Anyway, I think he will</seg><seg type="columnLine">send a substitute. He's too smart to risk</seg><seg type="columnLine">his neck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Jack. This is my affair. I believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can overcome the Falcon. Your duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">is here at the ship, and don't you worry</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the Falcon coming himself. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunch about his sensitive pride is a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that Millstein clumped forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a round airlock in the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. Writh a resigned sigh, Cromwell</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed in Millstein's awkward-looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, that was clumsily gloved with</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely flexible metals, a heavy old-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashioned army cutlass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">74</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HIEF, I've sharpened that meat</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife till it's like a razor.

Good luck!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a minute," laughed Millstein,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you act like I'm going out to meet his</seg><seg type="columnLine">satanic majesty.

You'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in full command in case anything hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pens to me. And don't forget this. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Falcon should overpower me, and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of any treachery on the part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enemy ship I should be captured, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what to do. You know that trick</seg><seg type="columnLine">we talked over, the emergency ruse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Screw the helmet on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Millstein pushed forward to the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steel lock that was like an iron coffin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There he adjusted his oxygen valves and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested the heat generators. Perspiration</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly streamed from his body, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the apparatus off, realizing it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">operating efficiently. He could not speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, for the helmet was tight over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, but through its clear quartz lens he</seg><seg type="columnLine">winked insultingly at the anxious Crom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well. With a nod of his head, Millstein</seg><seg type="columnLine">signalled for the inner lock-door to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed. Cromwell turned the lever, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">serrated door of the toughest steel, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet thick, slowly closed in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cromwell, leaving a perfectly smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cromwell yearned with all the fiery</seg><seg type="columnLine">ardor of his adventurous young heart and</seg><seg type="columnLine">an adoring love for his chief to be in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle to come. His duty was to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main as instructed, and with grim deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mination depicted upon his countenance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pushed another lever. This he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the outer steel door of the lock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Millstein was free to push out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vast void of endless space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Millstein, wise to the uncanny condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of space, gave a slight push against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall of the airlock and almost in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly was several hundred feet from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Nemesis.' It was a strange sensation</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating out in that vast void, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nemesis" and the "Avenger" were</seg><seg type="columnLine">"standing still." In reality the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass, in fact all the universe is moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one direction at a vast rate of speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But as each object in space retains its</seg><seg type="columnLine">relative position unless given inertia, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to Millstein that the two ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">and himself were motionless. He slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his right arm that held the sabre.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The structure of the material that cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered and protected that strong arm was</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremely heavy, and Millstein moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a figure on a slow motion picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment or two he practised</seg><seg type="columnLine">wielding the sword, for he knew his life</seg><seg type="columnLine">depended upon his skill and quickness</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that weapon. The movement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising his arm caused his body to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">over out of balance, so that his face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the enemy ship. That would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not do. Swinging the sword violently in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opposite direction, he succeeded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning his grotesque looking body. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">space an object will move forever at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate of its initial inertia. This is because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the complete vacuum, no air and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistance. In space acceleration and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate are affected only by the mass of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body to be accelerated. This effect is due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to what is termed inertia. Etymologically</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking, inertia can be termed the "lazi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of matter," for in human life laziness</seg><seg type="columnLine">is sometimes the deadest kind of resis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   OW that Millstein was out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">**■ ^ space ship, he had to be extremely</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful not to accelerate any movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">too quickly. Tests on earth had shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">that humans could attain a speed of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and fifty miles an hour in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">second of acceleration without injury,</seg><seg type="columnLine">providing the person was in perfect phys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical condition. The principal danger that</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VELOCITY OF ESCAPE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">confronted Millstein in his coming duel</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Falcon was the risk of sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning while travelling at high speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This would generate centrifugal force, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect similar to that of acceleration, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which has a tendency to drive the blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">violently from one side to the other, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">risking the rupture of blood vessels. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the learned and skilled scientist was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of all these hazards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Once more he checked off the condition</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his oxygen valves and heat units and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found them to be operating perfectly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he looked carefully toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar-like shape of the mighty "Avenger."</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a few moments his eyes made out</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tiny figure floating between himself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enemy ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Falcon!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With his left hand Millstein pulled one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the propulsion pistols from his belt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fired it in a direction exactly opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that portion of space occupied by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Falcon. Instantly Millstein's body shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, and for a moment his breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">came painfully. Clumsily, like a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to pick up a thin dime with boxing</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloves, he adjusted the energy charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pistol by means of a large-handled</seg><seg type="columnLine">screw on the side of the pistol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Charges are too strong/' he muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The propulsion pistols were not wea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pons of offense or defense. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply the means of propulsion in space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By firing the pistol, which discharged a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very small burst of atomic energy rays,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its recoil pushed Millstein in the desired</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction. Inasmuch as he would move</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever at the rate of his initial inertia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was necessary to stop by firing a charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the opposite direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again he looked toward the "Avenger"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and noted that the other human figure, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it could be termed a human figure, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now very much closer. This was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the supreme test of Millstein's flashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">career. He realized full well the des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate odds against the success of this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">encounter. He was keenly aware of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental powers and resources of his clever</seg><seg type="columnLine">antagonist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Glancing about in four dimensions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching the void carefully, he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">no trace of the government scout ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been plunging dizzily about in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's positive proof," muttered Mill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stein, "that the government scout-ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commander's brain is under the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Falcon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Glancing again toward the rapidly ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching figure of his opponent, Mill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stein could see the other was advancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">warily, circling as if to study his foe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan a proper attack. Then a very clever</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought came to the young scientist. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few moments he closed his eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrated his mind on the task before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, summoning to his immediate control</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his mental faculties and physical en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ergies. He made his mind a complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">negative as far as all other problems were</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned. For the moment he forgot</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own space ship, the 'Nemesis/ Crom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well and the brave men he had left be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind. In moments of great emergencies</seg><seg type="columnLine">Millstein always followed this rule, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew his enemy, vast and far-reaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">though his intellect was, would have an</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible amount of detail on his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was well that Millstein suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened his eyes after his mental concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tration, for scuttling toward him at terri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fic velocity came the huge, crab-like figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Falcon. Shrewdly and tensely</seg><seg type="columnLine">Millstein awaited the bull-like charge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then at the last split second, propelled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a heavy charge from his propulsion pis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tol, he barely eluded the fearless rush of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was close!" muttered Millstein.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like two grotesque crustaceans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighed down with the vast pressure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mighty but transparent water, the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighters maneuvered. Their attacks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodges were surprisingly quick, yet their</seg><seg type="columnLine">76</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">arms moved with painful slowness--</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved like Sisyphus toiling up the eternal</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain. Time after time the Falcon</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged, but always Millstein dodged like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very clever bull fighter, who slips aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it seems he will be impaled upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horns of a furious bull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Millstein was employing a very clever</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan of attack. He was saving his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength. The effort of moving heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">protected arms and legs took a tremen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dous lot of energy in the mysterious realm</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nothing. Millstein wisely figured that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Falcon was using up his propulsion</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol charges very rapidly. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">soundless battle. If either spoke or cursed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sounds only thundered in their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly as the Falcon was circling</seg><seg type="columnLine">for another charge, Millstein keeping his</seg><seg type="columnLine">propulsion pistol well concealed, fired a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden blast, and was hurtled directly to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the Falcon. It was a propitious</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment for Millstein's attack, as the Fal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">con's body was turned in air so that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not present his sword in defense.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a moment it looked as though they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would collide, and the Falcon be pierced</seg><seg type="columnLine">through and through, for Millstein held</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heavy blade directly in front of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not try to wield or swing it, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might have turned his body, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might then be placed in a position where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not defend himself. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitter moment for Millstein, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited long and patiently through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird struggle for this moment. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falcon could not raise his pistol in time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fire and dodge away, but he succeeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in meeting the attack, and with a move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment that must have taken incredible</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength, swung up his sword and parried</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thrust of Millstein's sword.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up to this time the movements of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">combat had been comparatively slow, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">now they seemed to move about like two</seg><seg type="columnLine">infuriated monsters of the deep ocean.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As Millstein plunged by his enemy in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden charge, he immediately twisted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">protect his rear. To his consternation the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falcon was directly behind him and forc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his acceleration at a dangerous rate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was then that Millstein displayed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peak of his fighting skill and bravery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shrewdly noting his position, he fired</seg><seg type="columnLine">several atomic blasts against the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of his travel, holding the pistol to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side that his body might be turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet his foe. He was infuriated. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a battle to the death. Humanity</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be well served if Millstein could</seg><seg type="columnLine">die and wipe out the dangerous Falcon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY were together! Millstein found</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chance, and risking all, he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leased his hold on his propulsion pistol,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with his strong left hand grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left shoulder of the other. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">too close now to use their swords, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they slowly turned, clutched together,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evil eyes of the Falcon glared through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his quartz lenses into Millstein's eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Millstein suddenly felt a great pulling</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his right shoulder and saw that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falcon had also released his propulsion</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol and grasped him with his clumsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. Millstein knew he must act quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he could feel the fearful strength of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other trying to twist his arm and tear</seg><seg type="columnLine">his space suit. Like a man in a dream,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he watched the sword arm of the Falcon</seg><seg type="columnLine">creep upward and raise the sword point.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The clever Russian was maneuvering his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorter weapon that he might pierce Mill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stein's space suit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Millstein suddenly felt as though a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly gas had entered his brain--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not care what happened. Stub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bornly he fought against this sluggish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, for he knew that the Russian was</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to use a hypnotic or mental influ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence. After a moment's concentration,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he watched the point of the sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly move upward, a great mental and</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical strength came to Millstein; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that he was the other's master.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VELOCITY OF ESCAPE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Concentrating all his muscular effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">and energy into one mighty effort, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck violently with the hilt of his sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the wrist of the Falcon. It was a des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate blow, and while the movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to travel with infinite slowness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet the heavy heel of the cutlass struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Russian's arm with stunning force</seg><seg type="columnLine">long before the point of the deadly sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept upward to Millstein's body. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great exultation Millstein saw the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutlass of the Falcon drift away from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasping hand, and soon the sharp wea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pon was many feet away from them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Millstein had conquered the Falcon, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must be careful, infinitely careful, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew full well the vast resources and</seg><seg type="columnLine">treachery of the distorted mind. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly as possible and still holding his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental concentration, Millstein raised the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of his cutlass and inserted its sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">point under the shoulder plate of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other's space suit. The Falcon glared</seg><seg type="columnLine">with malicious hatred into Millstein's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. The Falcon was defeated, for with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a powerful, cutting thrust, Millstein's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword could be slipped through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">armor's joint and allow the oxygen in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falcon's space suit to escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT the evil powers of the Falcon</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not expended. Still grinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a horrible hate, he raised his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand sluggishly above his head. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort of a signal! A terrific tingling</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke out over Millstein's body. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind became numbed. His muscles would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not function.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Treachery!

The uncanny instinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had carried him safely through many</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible perils, functioned even before</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brain had cleared away the deadly fog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly memory returned to him.

He was lying on some</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft substance, probably a couch, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew he was a captive on board the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Avenger."

Millstein</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared a broken man as he walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, but his shrewd, trained mind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">noting every detail and analyzing every</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity. He observed keenly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements of every man, keeping a care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful observation of the Falcon's move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They finally entered a large tube at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the ship, a tube about thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in diameter.

As Millstein</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being pushed into this tiny projectile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he noted the Falcon had suddenly dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared. This was a cause of worry to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Millstein, for he wished with a mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope that the Falcon would accompany</seg><seg type="columnLine">the group on the trip to his own ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minutes passed, and the crew were each</seg><seg type="columnLine">at their particular post ready to launch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little carrier ship. Millstein noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that each man was heavily armed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray guns and equipped with some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">protective armor; a strange, metallic fab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ric that glowed with the light of dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors. Millstein reasoned the suits were</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistive screens against ray guns of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  To his great relief the tall figure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falcon suddenly entered the little craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took a place at the main controls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Millstein, standing only a few feet from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Falcon, studied his enemy with in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finite care. The Russian returned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching scrutiny with a baleful glance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some reason the madman appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a bit thinner in spite of the fact he</seg><seg type="columnLine">also wore the strange metal garment that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed with some strong and static</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy. At the moment Millstein did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">consider this of unusual importance, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he put the thought out of his mind. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel door of the space projectile was</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed. Verensky uttered sharp, gutteral</seg><seg type="columnLine">commands in that weird tongue, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Millstein knew they were floating in</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. Soon he felt the slight grating</seg><seg type="columnLine">contact against his own ship. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had entered one of its carrier tubes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His heart thrilled, and the strong muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his body tensed for action. He bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head and concentrated all his mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">capacities on the coming test.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was rudely pushed through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open door of the little space carrier into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the launching and boarding tube of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own ship.

None but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he in the group knew how to operate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong steel doors that would admit them</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly into the 'Nemesis.' The cleverly</seg><seg type="columnLine">constructed doors of incredibly tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel slid silently back. Millstein in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead of the entire group stepped directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into one of the power rooms of the 'Nem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esis'. He glanced about and a cleverly</seg><seg type="columnLine">faked moan escaped his tense lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Slumped over at the seats of their oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ating chairs and lying in grotesque heaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor were his fine, trained assis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tants.

By what leap of the imagina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion the professor bridged the gap from</seg><seg type="columnLine">insect to human and thought of applying</seg><seg type="columnLine">waspish methods to mankind, is a ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that will perhaps never be answered:</seg><seg type="columnLine">but at all events we know that, after years</seg><seg type="columnLine">of research, he had solved the secret of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insect poison, and was able to brew</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in considerable quantities and to apply</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in a practical way to mankind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the beginning, it appears, Dr. Man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dano's motives were wholly laudable; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been his hope to develop a new an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aesthetic which would supplant ether and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it possible to perform operations</seg><seg type="columnLine">without inconvenience or danger to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient.

It was literally what the name im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plies--the means of preserving men, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of preserving them over indefinite lengths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time. Not a mere method of keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">their mummified corpses! a method of</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping the men themselves in a state</seg><seg type="columnLine">between sleep and death. An injection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than one cubic centimeter of Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mandano's paralyzing fluid, based on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">formula learned from the wasps, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">causc a man to collapse into a state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeming lifelessness: he would cease to</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathe, there would be no sign of heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">action, his face would take on a waxy pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lor which would show no sign of change</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the course of days, weeks or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">years; and yet, at any time, upon the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jection of the proper antidote, he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be revived, feeling a little drowsy, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">one awakened from deep slumber, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">otherwise unaffected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The secret of suspended animation, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a word, had been mastered!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But having been mastered, it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">employed, as it might have been, for hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manitarian and surgical purposes. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead, as the world in this good year 2054</seg><seg type="columnLine">is well aware, it became the nefarious tool</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a political and social class.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is not certain whether Dr. Mandano</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself was involved in the misuse of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">invention; or whether, beneath the iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">compulsion of the Querzal dictatorship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he bent reluctantly to the will of the gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment and delivered over the paralyz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fluid into hands less scrupulous than</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own. In any case, the result is in no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt at all. Some evil genius, in an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky hour, conceived of the idea of pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serving and storing the nation's excess</seg><seg type="columnLine">man-power: of preserving and storing it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">precisely as one would preserve and</seg><seg type="columnLine">store so many hams, herrings or dill</seg><seg type="columnLine">pickles. Why not build huge warehouses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he argued, where all excess human beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be kept and filed away for refer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence ? Why not take all beggars and vaga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonds, and put them into a state of sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended animation until the dawn of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">better day? Why not seize all unem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ployed workers and their families, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of allowing them to become a bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den on the community, quietly paralyze</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and leave them in registered com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partments, until their services should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">required, when they might be immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakened? And why not, in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner, build up a vast and irresistible</seg><seg type="columnLine">army? Why not train as many soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">as possible, and then, instead of continu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to feed and quarter them, put them</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a state of inexpensive paralysis until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the advent of war should make them</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary ? In this manner Peravia might</seg><seg type="columnLine">build up a matchless military machine at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minimum of cost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is needless to add that these argu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, though appealing to the principles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Querzal government and though</seg><seg type="columnLine">acted upon without delay, were carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept from public knowledge. Indeed, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">now believed that several political offend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, who in 2034 were summarily sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenced to the noose, had been guilty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing beyond some inadvertent sugges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions hinting at the government's new</seg><seg type="columnLine">project. Browbeaten and docile as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peravian people had long been, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no reason to suppose that they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenance this un-heard-of, latest</seg><seg type="columnLine">atrocity of their leaders; hence none but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few high government officials, a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">military chieftains, a group of medieal</seg><seg type="columnLine">advisers, a handful of great industrial-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ists and Dr. Mandano himself, had any</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion of what was in contemplation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   VEN when the plan had actually been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   put into operation, the law of abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE WASP</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">93</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lute secrecy prevailed, and the govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment proceeded by means of ruses and</seg><seg type="columnLine">subterfuges designed to throw dust into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eyes of the people. The only public</seg><seg type="columnLine">pronouncement was directly misleading:</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, in the interest of the public health,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a State medical examination of all citizens</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be undertaken, beginning on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular date. In the systemmatic man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner characteristic of the Peravians, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">individuals and families were to appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">at various assigned times before duly</seg><seg type="columnLine">constituted Boards, who were to compile</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most thoroughgoing "health census"</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever known to history. Little did the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspecting common man realize that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being made to walk into a trap!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a majority of cases, it is true, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trap was not allowed to spring; merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the sake of appearance, millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were put through a superfluous phys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical examination. But in hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of instances--and eventually in</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions--the citizen, in his ignorance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked to a fate he would not knowingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">have accepted without a struggle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hence it would occasionally happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">that some man--more often than not an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unemployed artizan or laborer--would</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappear after being summoned for ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amination, and would not be heard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Or some stout and brawny youth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been undergoing military train-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in a private or public corps, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanish as if swallowed up by the earth; or</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whole family--always of the poorer</seg><seg type="columnLine">classes, and often previously dependent</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon charity--would fail to return from</seg><seg type="columnLine">its appointed examination, and neighbors</seg><seg type="columnLine">would inquire in vain as to its where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abouts. Officials, when questioned, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely shake their heads with a "know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing" expression; the police would</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove either unwilling or unable to be of</seg><seg type="columnLine">help; the public press, being dominated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Querzal party, would never so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as mention any of the missing; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rank and file of the populace, if now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and then their suspicions were aroused,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would find that a word, indiscreetly ut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, would send them to a Concentra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion Camp if not to the executioner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile, in spite of the ferocious</seg><seg type="columnLine">restraints of the Censorship Bureau,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange rumors were making their way</seg><seg type="columnLine">through carefully guarded underground</seg><seg type="columnLine">channels. Tales were told that made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair of the listeners literally stand on</seg><seg type="columnLine">end; tales that brought muttered oaths</seg><seg type="columnLine">and curses to many an indignant lip, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that caused many eyes to stare in amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment or incredulity. One heard reports</seg><seg type="columnLine">of intricately winding galleries which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like modern catacombs, were laden with</seg><seg type="columnLine">innumerable bodies--and one was told</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these were the bodies not of dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, but of living. One heard wild stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">of torture-rooms, where physicians, hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing stripped their unwary patients for</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical examination, would slyly inject</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hypodermic which caused the victims to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reel over like men stricken suddenly dead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And one was assured that, by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a carefully arranged card system, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitudes of slumbering individuals were</seg><seg type="columnLine">all placed and catalogued, each with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">appropriate designation: for example,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"1964 XW 2/17/34, automobile me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanic, unemployed, 25 yrs. old at time of</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspended activities"; or, "4456 VT</seg><seg type="columnLine">3/11/35, trained infantryman, proficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">in rifle practice, 22 yrs. old at time of S.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A."; or, again, "TYU 1154, 1155 and</seg><seg type="columnLine">1156, 12/18/36, man, wife and son, dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerous radicals, 43, 37 and 13 at time of</seg><seg type="columnLine">S.

This concerned a secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">incinerating chamber, where each day</seg><seg type="columnLine">scores of unfortunates were brought for</seg><seg type="columnLine">cremation.

Decorated for heroism dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the Equadorian War nearly thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years before, he had become violently</seg><seg type="columnLine">anti-militant after the Armistice, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">publicly destroyed his badges and decora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, and had worked ardently in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of international understanding and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disarmament. Following the rise of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Querzal to power, he was condemned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Concentration Camp, from which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped after harrowing adventures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking refuge in the United States,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he remained for several years. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling that his native country needed him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he smuggled himself back over the bor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, and, living the existence of a hunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature, carried on secret propaganda at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the daily risk of his life. By means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spies and underground emissaries--for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sympathizers even in the highest cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cles he gradually made himself the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a vast organized ring, the so-called</seg><seg type="columnLine">League of Free Men, which, working</seg><seg type="columnLine">through subterranean channels, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">vowed to overthrow the reigning tyranny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A strangely assorted group they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were--disgruntled clerics, Communists,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thwarted laborers, disinherited intellec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuals, women disenfranchised, and adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turers ready to clutch at any straw! Yet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE WASP</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">95</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">though they were so motley a crowd;</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they seemed to have undertaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hopeless task, and met with discourage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment after discouragement; though many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their members were seized by the police</seg><seg type="columnLine">and summarily executed, they were held</seg><seg type="columnLine">together by the force of their convictions</seg><seg type="columnLine">and became a greater power than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">authorities were able to realize. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Captain Cardenzos that was their</seg><seg type="columnLine">guiding spirit, and he it was that set off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spark which precipitated the explo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EVER since its formation, the League</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Free Men had been investigating</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumors concerning the Man-Preserver;</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, it was probably through members</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the League that most of the rumors</seg><seg type="columnLine">started. But at first its efforts had borne</seg><seg type="columnLine">little fruit other than in the martyrdom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">several League members by the execu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioner's noose.

And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same time, his secret agents ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired other information which made it</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible for him to plan a way to block</seg><seg type="columnLine">the war, and incidentally to accomplish</seg><seg type="columnLine">the avowed purpose of the League by</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushing the Querzalists forever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The never-to-be-forgotten thirtieth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">July, 2043, was the date set for launch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the League Revolution.

Ordinarily, armed sentries</seg><seg type="columnLine">were parading before the entrance, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this occasion they were conspicuously</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacking; indeed, the gate itself, by what</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have seemed a bit of official care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessness, swung invitingly ajar, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cardenzos and his band strode in there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no one to restrain them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But mumbled passwords were quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">interchanged with a waiting party within;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the newcomers, as they surged</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the passageway, cast casual</seg><seg type="columnLine">glances at a dozen sentries strewn about</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in a state of insensibility, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed hastily on to accomplish the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night's mission.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GUIDED bv maps and blueprints,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they made their way through tortu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously winding, electrically lighted pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sageways through labyrinthine corridors</seg><seg type="columnLine">that not only filled the building but</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched underground in a long succes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of basements; and into apartments</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffused with vile-smelling concoctions</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminding one of a mortuary chamber.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On every side of them, in orderly recep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacles, long rows of coffin-shaped boxes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were resting on shelves--scores of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds, thousands, ten of thousands!--</seg><seg type="columnLine">so many that it made one dizzy merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look at them. And beneath the cello-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phane covering of each box one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguish a wax-like human face, silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">and still as if in slumber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Working according to prearranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan, and yet filled with the fury of des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peration, the rebels set about completing</seg><seg type="columnLine">their victory.

A single drop of the liquid, forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the veins of the sleeper, would pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duce an almost magical effect.

One is that Captain Carden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zos, an avowed pacifist, should have re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorted to the use of arms--though it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE WASP</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">97</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult to see bow he could have pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vailed unless willing to oppose force with</seg><seg type="columnLine">force at the crucial juncture. Another is</seg><seg type="columnLine">in what manner he succeeded in recruiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">an efficient army with such unparalleled</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed and securing arms and ammuni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. But the second question is more</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily answered than the first: for it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not really Cardenzos that recruited the</seg><seg type="columnLine">army; it was his enemies that recruited</seg><seg type="columnLine">it It must be remembered that more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">half the men had been trained as sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diers and intended by the Government for</seg><seg type="columnLine">use in the war against Argenzela and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bolador; it must be remembered, also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that abundant weapons and uniforms</seg><seg type="columnLine">were at hand in great underground ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mories, conveniently placed near the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">storage chambers, so as to avoid unneces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary delay in case of hostilities. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it is recalled that the revived men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by virtue of their very numbers, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily batter down the doors of the armor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ies and take possession, one should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no difficulty in understanding how Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Cardenzos, on the fateful first of</seg><seg type="columnLine">July, was able to place himself at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of so great an army.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His military experience, acquired dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">irg the War a generation before, was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">to serve him well. And yet his triumph</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hardly a matter of military skill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wherever he went, he was hailed, urged</seg><seg type="columnLine">on and supported by crowds of people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">long groaning beneath the Querzal des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">potism, and long powerless to defend</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves. And wherever he went, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy fled like rats hounded out of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">holes by terriers. Only in a few fortresses</seg><seg type="columnLine">and army strongholds did they dare to</seg><seg type="columnLine">defend themselves, and even there they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not long withstand the popular</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury; for they were deserted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular army on which they had placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">reliance. After one or two battles in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the masses, though ill organized,</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevailed by virtue of their irresistible en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thusiasm, the surviving Querzalists scur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ried in multitudes across the national</seg><seg type="columnLine">frontiers; while other multitudes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken prisoners, or were brought down</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the guns or swords of the onsweeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">Revolutionaries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In-so-far as he could, however, Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Cardenzos curbed all violence and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloodshed, thereby showing a self-res-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traint rare among victorious rebels. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gave orders that all captives be scrupu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lously guarded--and the sentence that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">inflicted upon them was not only unique</seg><seg type="columnLine">in history but represents one of the rar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est strokes of ironic justice of which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have any record. No sooner had he been</seg><seg type="columnLine">established at the head of the League</seg><seg type="columnLine">government, no sooner had he announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the restoration of the Peravian Republic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and been elected President by an over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelming majority, than he proposed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried out the punishment of "Scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">Incarceration" upon all leaders of the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feated party, upon the generals and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dustrialists who had urged the use of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man-Preserver, and upon the physicians</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had lent their aid in paralyzing mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions of unwilling victims.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T) UT what, precisely, was "Scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">Incarceration"? Nothing more nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than Man-Preserving: the paralyzing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the culprit and his preservation in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of suspended animation. In accord-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance with the Presidential decree, fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand men and women were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">demned to this novel penalty; and all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, undergoing a sentence of indefinite</seg><seg type="columnLine">duration, were stored in those under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground labyrinths where their former vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tims had been secreted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And there to this day they remain.

Green, slime-covered walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">dripping with moisture, jutting rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">that reached out their sharp points to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tear at him, the echoes of the lapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters, black slimy shapes that rose to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface, then disappeared into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inky water--all these would have un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerved a man made of less stout stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the red-bearded giant who impas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sively studied every passing character-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istic on his strange journey. The tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perature of the water was delightfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm to his touch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Probably volcanic origin," he mused.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's bound to become steaming hot be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in this he was mistaken. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperature of the water dropped stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily, the air in the passage became chilly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finally frost appeared on the rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledges. Professor Norton donned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parka he had previously removed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thankful for its comforting warmth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon slabs of floating ice appeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">first as white patches in the distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the floes became denser until Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton peered with some alarm ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to see a solidly frozen sheet stretch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">106</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blue-white into the remote distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was only a matter of seconds be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he would be hurled at express</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed against this sheet of ice which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would surely crumple the thin metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">hull as if it were an egg shell. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to act quickly; no time to lose now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just as the little vessel reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid ice, he threw his weight into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern, and the bow of the craft shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">high into the air. The bottom struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sickening thud that threw Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's head forward until he thought that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had parted company with his spine;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, at slackened speed, the boat con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued over the rough ice pack to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth frozen surface, over which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly zoomed like a swift flying bird.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The powerful force had converted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal craft into an ice-boat that slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">along on its keel strips. Norton took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deep breath of relief, then huddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bottom with the searchlight pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to his body for warmth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE consulted his black note book.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yes, at the estimated rate of sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enty-five miles an hour in a westerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction he would reach his destination</seg><seg type="columnLine">in about fifty hours, after passing be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the Arctic Ocean, glacier-covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greenland, Baffin Bay, Baffin Land and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Gulf of Boothia. But fifty hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent in this weird, lonely place, speed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing like mad toward an unknown des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tination, was not any too pleasant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">contemplate, even for such a staunch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearted scientist as Norton. If he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">only taken Cullen into his confidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was sure that his good friend would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have joined him without an instant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitation. But now it w'as too late.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The song of the runners over the ice</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him drowsy; he dozed off, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally fell into a deep sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Crunch, splash!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His slumber was brought to an abrupt</seg><seg type="columnLine">end by the boat breaking through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ice and sailing beyond into open water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The frozen sheet had terminated, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his course now lay through w'ater once</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. But a new element entered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturb his equilibrium. The hours of</seg><seg type="columnLine">friction over the ice had worn the keel</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the boat down until it traveled along</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the unprotected plates of the bottom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearing the metal so thin that the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">squirted into the boat in a heavy spray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norton seized a scoop and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bail furiously, not daring to stop even</seg><seg type="columnLine">long enough to take his bearings. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">long he had slept, or how far he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled during that time he had no way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of determining.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was nip and tuck now between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise of the water in the bottom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat and the speed with which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could work the scoop. Hour after hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">he kept bailing, but it was a losing fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly the water rose, first to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ankles, next half way up his leg--thdn</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light went out. The generator, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had failed to inclose in a waterproof</seg><seg type="columnLine">housing, had been short-circuited. True,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there wras his pocket flashlight, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must conserve the precious batteries for</seg><seg type="columnLine">future emergencies, for only God knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he would be able to find his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of this dismal subterranean chamber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TTriTH head bent low and his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the immediate task of bailing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norton did not see the dark solid mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">that loomed up ahead. Steadily the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat bore down upon this obstruction. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">collision was inevitable. As the bow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vessel crashed into an unyielding</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance, the professor jerked his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and tried to jump. But it was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late. With irresistible force the boat tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scoped itself into buckled and twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel plates. Norton's body fetched up</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard against a hard substance and every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing went black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly consciousness returned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Living fires were searing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">NORTH GOD'S TEMPLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">107</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">frame; warmfi red blood oozed from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen cuts and scratches; one arm hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">immobile and useless, with a broken col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar-bone protruding through the torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking around with dazed eyes, Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton found himself on a narrow plateau</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the reach of the water. What re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained of the boat had probably sunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">from sight when he was hurled clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wreckage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cautiously he stretched out one leg,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the other. They, at least, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">intact. After a half dozen exhausting</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempts, he was able to raise his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his shaky legs, and hold himself erect</seg><seg type="columnLine">by leaning heavily against a cold, hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. Now he became curious. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist within him had taken control</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the obstacle of physical pain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental fatigue. He ran his hand up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down the side of the massive ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject. It was glass-smooth to the touch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With his good arm he managed to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flashlight in his pocket. Luckily it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had escaped destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He swept the beam upward. There,</seg><seg type="columnLine">towering some two hundred feet above</seg><seg type="columnLine">him was an obelisk-like tower of gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ebony! A hundred windows cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">its smooth surface, while at the top,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowning the summit, was a huge ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">studded with crystal window's that</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed back his light in a cascade of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectral colors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norton's eyes gleamed writh a fanatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. Here was his goal, the proof that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his researches and experiments had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been misdirected!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The base of the obelisk flared out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the platform on which he stood, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then disappeared from sight under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inky water. How much of it was below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface Norton had no means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing, but he judged that at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventy-five feet would be needed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stably support the mass of the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he attempted to walk he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back glued to the wall. He tugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pulled frantically, but to no avail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he grinned sheepishly and reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">around for an object in his hip pocket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The heavy automatic pistol he pulled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately flew from his grasp, crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">solidly against the wall, and stuck there!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the steel of the pistol which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">held him. He wras now released and</seg><seg type="columnLine">free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Magnetite; although a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">times more powerful," he exclaimed, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amining the substance closely, "yet it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">different from any mineral found on</seg><seg type="columnLine">our earth. Yes, I am positive that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure was hurled from some far</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet." And he whispered in an awed</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice: "The message was right, it must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the Temple of the Magnetic God!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Working his way cautiously around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the base of the structure, which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found to be octagonal and approximately</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty feet across, he came to the entrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was seeking. A circular doorway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloomy and uninviting led to the inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the temple. He had left his pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">adhering to the outer wall, yet without</seg><seg type="columnLine">any thought of fear, he boldly entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flashed his light around. The next</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he regretted his lack of caution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AS he turned his head he drew back</seg><seg type="columnLine">±1 with a jump, to stare right into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vacant eye sockets of a monstrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">skull! And strewn about within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber were hundreds of other skulls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bones of the creatures who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">worshipped and died here. The air was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dank with the odor of death and decay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls wrere festooned with rotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">draperies, the floor slimy from the ebb</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flow of the water that had flooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place periodically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nerved himself to examine the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mains more closely. The bones were</seg><seg type="columnLine">green with mould and crumbled to pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der at his touch. It was evident at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">108</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">glance that the creatures who had used</seg><seg type="columnLine">the temple for worship were not human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings in any sense of the word as ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied upon the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The skull was massive, measuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a foot across and shaped not</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlike that of a huge bird, yet it had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high and deep cranium, denoting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession of an enormous degree of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligence. The thorax was short, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thigh bones of the four legs un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">believably small; but the two arms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">terminating in delicate phalanges in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicated that the creature had twelve ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremely sensitive fingers that could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been possessed by a race skilled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">performing precision work or operating</seg><seg type="columnLine">complicated machines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Glancing up from the bones at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, Professor Norton's eyes riveted</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves upon a circular opening in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle of the vaulted roof. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening appeared small to him below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was undoubtedly large enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to admit the priests of the temple to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chambers where they had lived and</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked. The shaft was as smooth as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bore of a shot gun, and he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">detect no means of reaching it to gain</seg><seg type="columnLine">access to the upper part of the temple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They might have used ladders," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">mused, "but creatures possessing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligence of these surely must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">employed a more efficient system--some</seg><seg type="columnLine">type of elevator, perhaps."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This thought gave him an idea. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">took out his pocket knife and held it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the palm of his hand. "Whizz!

Now, to find the car."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He kicked away some rubbish and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones and discovered a circular trap</seg><seg type="columnLine">door directly below the shaft. At first</seg><seg type="columnLine">he imagined that it led to the basement</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the structure, but he now realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had some bearing upon the mode of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ascent. After considerable scratching</seg><seg type="columnLine">around he found the combination, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he pushed a button the trap-door sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">down slightly then slid aside, revealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a car that resembled a huge iron pot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boldly he stepped into it, and taking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance, pulled a lever that projected</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its side. At once the released</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicle shot up into the air and entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opening like the plunger of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solenoid. Up it went, until it came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest at the first level.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eagerly Norton stepped out into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory that was filled with strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking machinery and instruments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the eagerness of a small boy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a toy shop, the red-bearded scientist</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutely examined ever}* item and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fond hands caressed the fine mechanisms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of them he understood, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was much more that puzzled him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The problem of descending in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevator was solved when after trying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">various controls in the car, he discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one that served to neutralize the mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">netic force, permitting the car to drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">by gravity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On an upper level he found the elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trical generating plant in an operative</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition. Fortunately all the metals</seg><seg type="columnLine">used by these creatures were non-cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rosive, which accounted for the perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">preservation of the equipment. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw a switch, and at once the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in fact the entire tower, lit up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a soft sea-green light that illum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inated perfectly without dazzling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.

Hunger and thirst were tear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at their vitals. Stark fear and linger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing death within: pitiless, cold space with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of the two, Josh Malcolm was hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out better, as men of stronger mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nerve usually do.

More than</seg><seg type="columnLine">once he barely prevented the other from</seg><seg type="columnLine">helping himself while he slept, awaken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing just in time to frustrate Ed's selfish</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that the radial velocity of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meteor was gradually diminishing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">zero; by this time having receded to about</seg><seg type="columnLine">300,000 miles from the earth--fortunate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly in a direction away from the orbit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then one day, as days were counted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chronometer, his face lightened up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eagerly he went over his equations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ed, he shouted joyfully, "we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing closer to the earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ed stirred himself from his torpor;</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced eagerly toward Josh. "Are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure, are you sure?" His hands opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and closed spasmodically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, after a further look at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculations, Josh's face fell in hopeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">dejection. "I'm sorry to have raised</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">false hopes, Ed," he spoke sadly; "but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess I rejoiced too soon. I find that</seg><seg type="columnLine">though our centrifugal force is not equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the gravitational pull of the earth, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">though as a consequence we are now be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning to fall back to it--I fear too</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly to save us.

By</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time ... I don't think we shall be</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was true. At first imperceptibly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then at an accelerating rate, the Meteor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was drawing closer and closer to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. The initial momentum of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">radial component was exhausted. Gravita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was now forcing it earthward; at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first slowly, then faster and faster; until</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would approach the planet with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same velocity of 6.95 miles per second</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which it departed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Josh took careful stock of their remain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing few drinks of water and small supply</seg><seg type="columnLine">of air.

They grap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pled and, both being etherially light and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsteady of foot, fell to the floor. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle which ensued, Josh wrenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the automatic from the other's hand, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it fell like a feather to the floor out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reach of either.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Weak though both were, they battled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with frenzied energy, each striving to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick up the fallen weapon. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">about evenly matched for weight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength. Josh drove a hard right at Ed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who dodged the blow which was absurdly</seg><seg type="columnLine">ineffective due to their lack of weight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">causing the former, however, to slip to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one knee. In a flash the other leaped for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the automatic, but was tripped headlong</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Josh entwined his arms football fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion around the frenzied man's legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over and over the two men rolled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bouncing, cursing and yelling, striving for</seg><seg type="columnLine">mastery. The none too fresh air made</seg><seg type="columnLine">them gasp for breath. Their struggle was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tragi-comedy-farce, ludicrous in the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treme; for at their distance from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth they were practically weightless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their weight being only about 1/5800 as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as at its surface. They jumped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounced and floated about this way and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that, locked in each other's arms; their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mightiest blows landing feather-like, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickest motions ridiculously slow. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like some silly dream, without con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol or effectiveness. In their ineffectual</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggles Ed happened to bounce clear to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other end of the cabin, and Josh re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trieved the automatic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ed rose slowly to his feet, eyes blood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot, features distorted with meanness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly he backed away and stood in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">comer of the cabin, cowed into furious</seg><seg type="columnLine">submission by the levelled automatic in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hands of his companion, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing him with set jaw and glinting eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand still and don't move, Ed; or,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Heaven, so long as you are determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one of us shall pass out--you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the one.

For shame: I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought you were a man!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ed cowered sullenly, somewhat brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his senses.

Full well Josh knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that even if he did agree by lot as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">who should remain alive with the last of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their water and air, the other would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">abide by the draw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As things stood their situation was ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solutely hopeless.

The great</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing is the idea's all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the driver behind had a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion on the subject, and it was some</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable time before the usual for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">malities were concluded and once again</seg><seg type="columnLine">they maneuvered themselves into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream of traffic, which between times</seg><seg type="columnLine">had grown to much greater dimensions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After the first misadventure Stewart</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more careful, but even so found it</seg><seg type="columnLine">very difficult not to pull up in too short</seg><seg type="columnLine">a space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Passing through London in this man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, they drew away to the South.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll take to some of the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways," remarked Stewart, "so that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can carry out a few trials without fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther mishap."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Considering the fact that the weather</seg><seg type="columnLine">was delightful, the country roads were</seg><seg type="columnLine">PHOTO CONTROL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">129</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">comparatively free of traffic. They drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">along for some miles and were shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">down hill at a good pace when Stewart</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked out quickly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold tight; I'm going to brake."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bob clung on for all he was worth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was not much. Again he felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpleasant sensation, as if someone had</seg><seg type="columnLine">butted him in the stomach, and he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stewart extricated themselves from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not bad," murmured Stewart, clam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bering out. From his pocket he drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large roll of tape and between them</seg><seg type="columnLine">they measured up the braking distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stewart had depressed the lever as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they passed a particular gate, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there should be no doubt about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopping distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just over 17^ feet," he announced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What was the speed?" asked Bob.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly 94 and on a down gradient</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 1 in 7, but we must check this</seg><seg type="columnLine">again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After entering up the particulars they</seg><seg type="columnLine">backed up the hill and made a similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">giddy descent, this time being less for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunate in the result. Bob sustained a</seg><seg type="columnLine">severe cut on one arm, where he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown against the windshield, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rear tires burst. Stewart, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, was delighted, though he spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">little as they slowly retraced their way</seg><seg type="columnLine">through London and back to the work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shops.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as they reached home, me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanics were set on the job of stripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the wheels and brake mechanism,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so as to determine how much wear</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken place, and whether anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been severely strained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's no use relying too much on</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory, ray lad," said Stewart, catch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Bob's curious eye. "We have done</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot in the last few years in bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">design down to the standard of pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">mathematics, but you can never be abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely certain of the factor of safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The human element is far too great to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut down strength to the very minimum</seg><seg type="columnLine">which after all is the object of true de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Bob nodded. "We shall have to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good many changes before we try out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that old bus again.

We shall be able to lay down</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few principles and get Smithson to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work on an entirely new model. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid we shall have to re-design the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chassis. We can probably make use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the existing motors, although their accel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eration is far too low for our purposes."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Too low?" Bob raised his eyebrows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, only the other day I thought you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were complaining that acceleration was</seg><seg type="columnLine">far away in advance of the rest of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, it ■was" rejoined Stewart curtly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but let's go over the points in ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion which our mishap this morning has</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought to our notice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Back in the office they talked the mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter over at length and eventually Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">drafted out a series of proposals which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to be passed to the Chief Designer</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was to commence work immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a more elaborate model. Briefly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were as follows:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  (1)	In the first place, examination of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tires and wheel rims showed straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">away that each time the gyroscope had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been applied the complete tire had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">flattened so that the rim itself bit on</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the metalled roads. This was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason why a burst had occurred. Since</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was practically out of the question to</seg><seg type="columnLine">inflate tires to a higher pressure on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">score of comfort a new method was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be tried. By the side of each driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel was put another wheel some three</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches smaller in diameter, the tire made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a solid ring of hard rubber. Under</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal conditions this was just clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the roads and played no part in ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary driving. So soon as the brakes</seg><seg type="columnLine">130</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were applied and the gyroscope toggles</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove the car down to the face of the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">these solid wheels served for braking</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposes. By this means they hoped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">eliminate bursts and at the same time</seg><seg type="columnLine">enable even greater braking pressure to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be used if necessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stewart also postulated that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to develop a material more</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistant to abrasion than the common</seg><seg type="columnLine">type of synthetic rubber, but this would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be difficult since their experiments</seg><seg type="columnLine">had previously extended rather fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">into this field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> (2)	It was found that the brake shoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves besides being badly worn had</seg><seg type="columnLine">in places fused. Beryllium, long since</seg><seg type="columnLine">used as a material of construction in car</seg><seg type="columnLine">design, would have to be replaced by</seg><seg type="columnLine">something capable of standing up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher temperatures. Again, some meth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">or of cooling of the brake drums would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to be adopted. Stewart proposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to incorporate a small refrigerator such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as then used on racing cars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The greatest problem of all was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elimination of the human element of</seg><seg type="columnLine">braking together with its inevitable time</seg><seg type="columnLine">lag. It was all very well to design and</seg><seg type="columnLine">develop super-efficient brakes, but even</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would be of very little use in pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venting accidents if put under the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol of any Tom, Dick or Harry, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had enough money to buy a car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the weeks that followed, Bob spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of his time in the workshops,</seg><seg type="columnLine">supervising the construction of the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine with its strengthened brakes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chassis members. Experiments on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">synthetic rubber had been entirely satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">factory and they had decided on a ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terial composed of the usual elastic bond-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing agent and floculated asbestos which</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave astonishing results on dynamometer</seg><seg type="columnLine">tests.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stewart had retired to his private lab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oratory whence he issued only at meal</seg><seg type="columnLine">times. He was hard at work on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other side of the problem but gave no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">indication of the direction which his en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deavors were taking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Bob felt rather irritated at this atti-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tude, for he could not help remembering</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that it was his own particular idea which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> had brought the gyrobrake into being.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	What little spare time he had at his dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> posal he spent wondering how Stewart</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> proposed to rule out the trouble of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> brain reaction. In fact he went to sev-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> eral demonstrations of the newly de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> veloped robot chauffeurs, which how-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ever, had not yet gained the sanction of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the Transport authorities. What he saw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> at the demonstrations did not impress</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> him very much, for, although the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> mechanical men seemed capable enough</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of controlling a vehicle under simple cir-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> cumstances, it seemed very doubtful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> whether they would be able to show up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> well under the terrible traffic jam of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Metropolis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  One day Stewart appeared in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">workshop with a whole sheaf of draw-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ings under his arm and called Bob to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "I think the problem is pretty well</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cleared, my lad," he said in a curiously</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tense voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Bob was full of questions, but Stewart</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> was unduly reticent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We'll let Smithson get busy with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">these drawings and incorporate them in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the new model, and see how it works."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   With this Bob had to be content. Days</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> passed quickly and days into weeks and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> slowly the new machine grew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   At last came the day when it was com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> pleted. It resembled the ordinary road</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> car, except possibly its construction</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> seemed a trifle sturdier and the wheels</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> were, of course, novel. To the front two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> curiously shaped headlamps were placed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> at the lateral extremities on a compli-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> cated swivelling arrangement. Bob noted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> further that these apparent lamps were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> twisted slightly inwards and instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">PHOTO CONTROL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">131</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing towards the ground were di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rected straight out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was examining the foreign parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the car when Stewart came along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're due for a little explanation,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, to tell you the truth, I had be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun to wonder when you were going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stewart patted his shoulder. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry, my lad, but I have been very busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and very worried, but that's past now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let's have a look at the 'bus."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the idea of these head</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamps?" asked Bob.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're not headlamps, of course,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">rejoined the other. "Actually they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully prepared and focussed tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenses at the back of each of which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">situated one of the new ribidium photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric cells. But perhaps I'd better</seg><seg type="columnLine">start at the beginning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bob nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, it's like this," proceeded Stew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">art. "From the first it was clear that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was out of the question to leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of a car fitted with these new</seg><seg type="columnLine">brakes to the varying abilities and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">actions of a human driver. The ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was then to replace personal control</seg><seg type="columnLine">by something mechanical or, to be more</seg><seg type="columnLine">corrcct, electrical, since this is somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the sphere of mechanics. A little</seg><seg type="columnLine">consideration of the question showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that each car when driven at a particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed required a zone of safety in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of it extending just over the width</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the car and to a distance slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater than the stopping distance at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed at which the car was driven at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular moment. By some means or</seg><seg type="columnLine">other this speed zone had to be main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained. You see with your gyroscope we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can pull up a car driven at 90 miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour in, say, 15 feet. Good enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the time taken in braking and bring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the car to a standstill is very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than the actual time taken for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">driver to see the source of danger, trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit this to his brain and from the brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the various nerves and muscles down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his toe on the pedal. Good braking</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone would only make the whole ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of driving control more dangerous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">much after the style that acceleration has</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked havoc in the past years." His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes shone brightly. "But I'm getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the subjcct. You know, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, how we are able to judge dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I suppose because we have two</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes," suggested Bob.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly. Our eyes are set apart and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so when we look at an object they point</seg><seg type="columnLine">inwards and the subtended angles gives</seg><seg type="columnLine">us immediate indication of the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the object is away. Not exactly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, but at least to a degree. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">my arrangement, I duplicate these con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditions by what you refer to as head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamps. These are always trained ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the car and inwards to an extent de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pending on the speed. Actually their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountings are coupled indirectly to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road wheels so that the faster the wheels</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotate the lesser is the angle subtended</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the two sets of lenses. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">other words the faster the car goes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">further away is the point of intersection</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the two beams. This distance is on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this particular model four feet greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the minimum braking distance at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the particular speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately we are afforded a means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of noting whether the distance between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front of our car and the rear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicle in front of us is safe. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought in the first place to build an ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus after this style giving an audible</seg><seg type="columnLine">or visible indication, but, after all, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been practically useless, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brain-lag would come into the ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion again when the brakes had to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">applied immediately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As the thing stands now photo-elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tric cells are placed behind the lenses</seg><seg type="columnLine">132</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and as soon as any body falls within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the zone of safety the photo-cells are</seg><seg type="columnLine">affected and, operating on a relay, apply</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brakes to the full."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bob thought for a moment. "It seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very good stunt," he admitted at last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but does it take into consideration the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of any object? What I mean to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say is--supposing you arc driving to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards a building, I can see then that</seg><seg type="columnLine">your trained photo-cells snap on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brakes and prevent you crashing, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposing instead of its being a building</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was another car coming in the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction at a speed about the same as</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours. You might pull up in time, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">what about the other fellow?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh! of course," he laughed uncom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortably, "I forgot that all the cars</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be fitted in this manner. Still,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went on, "I'm not sure that I see it</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Steady, steady, you're quite right,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stewart assured him, "but I'd thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this already. When I said that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">photo-cells operated as soon as any ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject was brought within their field, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only stating the action roughly. As a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of fact, although they do operate</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that manner, they are also sensitive to</seg><seg type="columnLine">infra-red beams, which you have proba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bly guessed are used through the lenses."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I see," Bob nodded. "That seems all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. I suppose it works though?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course it works, or will work!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stewart was rather tart. "There are one</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two points that I have not mentioned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For instance rounding corners. I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose you have noticed that the car has</seg><seg type="columnLine">no steering wheel?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This has been replaced by a simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">right and left key switch. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver wishes to take a turn to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right he throws over the switch just be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore coming to the turn. Immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">the photo-visor lamps swing to the right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their angular speed being dependent on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">die speed of the car at the time. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">is adjusted so that road grip under worst</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions is sufficient to counteract the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inevitable centrifugal action of the mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the car. Later on, we can probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrange that wheel pressure is increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">while taking turns, so as to permit faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">and safer cornering."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Again--''Stewart continued, "but no,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a demonstration will be better than all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this talk. However, I can tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight away that all factors of road</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions have been taken into consid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eration. You can visualize the action of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the safety zone quite easily. Besides</seg><seg type="columnLine">being connected with the brakes, it also</seg><seg type="columnLine">acts on the accelerator, so you can im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agine the traffic of the main roads and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city itself. Speeds raised even high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er than they are to-day--all cars</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanically controlled by their photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zones. As soon as any object or any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other car or a pedestrian gets within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the zone so soon do the brakes come on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As soon as the object is removed the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">accelerates to its maximum. If the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject does not move the zone swerves first</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the left and then to the right seek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out its own path. At corners the</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver flips his switch and the zone</seg><seg type="columnLine">swings round accordingly seeking a safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">path. As it rounds a comer the gyro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure is applied automatically depend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on the speed. This particular piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of apparatus will be fairly easy to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vise and we shall probably profit by ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perimenting on the mercury pendulum."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Can't you see them?"

Much of it was known to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but this branch of science had progressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at such a pace that it needed a special-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ist eye to comprehend the functioning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">each detail. He moved towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great windows and stared down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strand with its turmoil of traffic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a great day for the world. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps the greatest day for a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">years.

A tur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moil truly, but an ordered turmoil, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bustling blundering of human hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the steady, infallible rush of me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanised science. Each of those thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand vehicles below him were travelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">at high speed, but none crashed, none</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in danger of crashing. Violent</seg><seg type="columnLine">braking, violent acceleration, sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">swerve, spin round a corner, stopping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting all were carried out with utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">precision.

Heavy penalties, brought to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">equivalent of attempted manslaughter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to be applied to any one found</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving manually-controlled machines.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not that anyone would have dared.

Now at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">day of triumph it seemed that the fires</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life were almost spent. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown thin, emaciated, but, with a de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clining physical strength, his eye had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown brighter, his brain more alert than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, albeit there had been strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapses. He had grown fond of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">company. Sometimes he would shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in his room for days and see</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one. Something was wrong with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jason Stewart.

"I'm afraid I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know anything about that.

He shook hands with Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervously and avoided his gaze. Without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a word he made to a side door, unlocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and disappeared within. The whine</seg><seg type="columnLine">of generators broke through the silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room, rose in pitch and disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared as it passed the limit of audible</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequency. Ten minutes, twenty min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes passed and the crystal indicator</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed five minutes to the hour. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">door opened and Stewart reappeared, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face flushed and of staring eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Five minutes.

His voice rose to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Steady, sir, steady!" Bob did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the look of things.

The ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort and endeavor of the past three years</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">combined with his brooding sorrow had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been too much.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Two minutes to go.

Ten million people were watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, were listening to the wheezy gasp</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his lips.

"Three years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago, I had a daughter, as many of you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have daughters.

Stew'art paused for breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams, standing just aside, thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have fallen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take it easy, sir," he suggested in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stewart glanced at him and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">some adjustment on the table.

To-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day I feel it more than ever." Sudden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly he laughed. "If I had a daughter I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might feel better, peoples of the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but you and your traffic took her away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from me. Look what I have given you</seg><seg type="columnLine">in return! Safety for yourselves, safety</seg><seg type="columnLine">for your daughters. D'you think I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fool, yes, an old fool?" He grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigid. "The safety of your traffic de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pends on my photo-zones.

Although</seg><seg type="columnLine">the so eloquent Mr. Rawson may have already</seg><seg type="columnLine">read what he terms "a waste of valuable space,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself and all the newer readers have not. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">A.

If</seg><seg type="columnLine">many letters like the one I have mentioned come</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, with its talk of nightmares and phony ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuses, you certainly have a lot to put up with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stall sympathize with you once more, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">start criticizing your magazine. It really is too</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad that you cannot express your thoughts about</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-flying without being so severely criti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cized. My common sense agrees with you about</seg><seg type="columnLine">such stories as "Triplanetary," but my opti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mism is up in arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cover on the May issue is, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">much better than any yet, so much better that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I scarcely recognized the magazine. The pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent size is convenient and makes the magazine</seg><seg type="columnLine">easier to hold while reading.

After all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what does the format matter, anyway?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having defended the reprints, I should praise</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. "The Diamond Lens" was fine and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the story (I forgot wThat the title was) of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clockmaker that thought he could create</seg><seg type="columnLine">life much better. I liked seeing the "Gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bug" in our magazine, although I had read it</seg><seg type="columnLine">before; it was like meeting an old friend. Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinue the reprints, they rest one's mind after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stress and strain of ultra-space, sub-ether,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inertia-less matter, green emanation, red heat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays. blue disintegration rays--and pink ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phants. At one time I liked interplanetary stories,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but now there is so little story and so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray, wave, new kinds of ether and vile forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life, that they all leave the same impression:</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion. "Terror Out of Space" started out</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine, but in the end it deteriorated until it fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed the same old formula as all the others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By this time, the indignant reader will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered that I did not particularly like "Tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetary" or "When the Universe Shrank."</seg><seg type="columnLine">In spite of my aversion to waves and rays, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked "The Ultra-Gamina Wave," because it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one wave and the reader did not get</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixed up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thoioughly enjoyed "The Lost City," but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a shameful trick of the author's to break</seg><seg type="columnLine">off just when "Things Began to Happen." Talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of breaking off, the piece pulled out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of "Dr. Grimshaw's Sanitarium" pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vented an excellent story from becoming well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nigh perfect. In spite of the preponderance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those old spoilers 'ultra, super, sub, wave and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray,' the Jameson stories have me cheering for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Even if they have their faults, they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">so unusual and interesting in plot that they sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply refuse to be ruined. "The Lost Language"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a wonderful story. Mr. Wolheim's letter</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the subject was also interesting. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Regenerative Wonder" and "The Death Proto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zoan" were two very good stories. I think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time travelling idea is getting somewhat out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn, unless it is used simply as the instrument</seg><seg type="columnLine">for telling a more interesting narration. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was done in "The Mentanicals" and in "Time's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mausoleum" to a certain extent. "The Theft of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Washington Monument" and "The Time</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jumpers" were just undiluted time-travelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as a result were not nearly as good as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first two. There was one humorous time-travel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling story that I believe was called "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Island." That I found very interesting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusing. Why not get the author to write a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequel to it? "The Supermen'' might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly good when the author first got the idea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he completely ruined it for me by writing it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in diary form. Two other stories that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">outstandingly well written and interesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">were "Cat's Eye" and "Peril Among the Driv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers," Readers interested in the latter story</seg><seg type="columnLine">might find the hook "Insect Behaviour" by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cheeseman excellent reading.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have just one more suggestion to offer. (I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that you must be tired of suggestions, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">how are you to know what we readers want</seg><seg type="columnLine">and don't want unless we tell you?) Amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stories could be made more interesting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">people who can only get it occasionally if only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one serial were given each month and the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fiction space were devoted to short</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories.

I always liked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">receding title; and, too, the larger magazine</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to possess more wordage. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I think of the fact that so far the covers</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been 100% perfect, in contrast to many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the older magazine covers, and the magazine</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself much better bound, I think the new format</seg><seg type="columnLine">is almost as good.

A story</seg><seg type="columnLine">written up to book length always seems to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be better written than the short story, possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bly because there is always the chance that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long story will be made into a book, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">short story lives only a short while; conse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently the author spends more time and art on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the longer one. Now I see that you have three</seg><seg type="columnLine">serials, and with me that registers o. k. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought I had either read or knew the titles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all of Verne's fantastics, but "Measuring a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meridian'' is one I never heard of.

So you see the Editor is really</seg><seg type="columnLine">between two fires in wanting to do what im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">presses one as right and also in wishing to pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lish what his readers will like. You are a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little too hasty in your criticism of such dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinguished authors as the ones you name. H.

It is curious that</seg><seg type="columnLine">while you object to the reprint, "A Decent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Into the Malestrom", you say it has been re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">printed about fifteen times already. Does not</seg><seg type="columnLine">this indicate that at least fifteen Editors have</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed with us? It is a long time since we</seg><seg type="columnLine">published a story by Wells. In 1927 and 1928</seg><seg type="columnLine">we gave a number of them and we consider</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were well received.

First of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wish to protest loudly about the printing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Edgar Allen Poe's stories in our mag. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is nothing worth while in the way of science in</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.

If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you insist on his stories why not publish another</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine containing his complete works. Oh</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, maybe by the time this letter is printed</seg><seg type="columnLine">(if it is) you will have gotten over your mania</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Poe stories.
