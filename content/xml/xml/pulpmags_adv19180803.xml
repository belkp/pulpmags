It is so</seg><seg type="columnLine">written in the book of Abulghazi, called by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some Abulfarajii, historian of dynasties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was on such a night of power, say the</seg><seg type="columnLine">annals of Abulghazi, that Hulagu Khan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nephew of Ghengis Khan and leader of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Golden Horde overcame the citadel of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alamut, the place of strange wickedness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the river Shahrud, in the province of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rudbar.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange prophecy. And never had Khlit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cossack of the Curved Saber, shared in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a hunt. It was not of his own seek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing--the hunt that disclosed the secret of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alamut.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">response was not slow in coming, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">from an unexpected quarter. A cloaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure rose from the shadows behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one lamp which lighted the shop and con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fronted him. The cloak fell to the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disclosed a sturdy form clad in a fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tipped tunic under which gleamed a coat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mail, heavy pantaloons, and a peaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet. A pair of slant, bloodshot eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at Khlit from a round face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Khlit recognized the newcomer as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tatar warrior of rank, and noted that while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other was short, his shoulders were wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">and arms long as his knees. Simultaneously</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khlit's curved saber flashed into view, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tatar's scimiter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As quickly, the Syrian merchant darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a corner. Cossack and Tatar, enemies</seg><seg type="columnLine">by instinct and choice, measured each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously. Neither moved, waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other to act. Khlit's pipe fell to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor and he did not stoop to pick it up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Toctamish!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a woman's voice, shrill and angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">that broke the silence.

Above the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">garment which covered her from foot to</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat, her black hair hung around a face</seg><seg type="columnLine">which arrested Kill it's attention. Too</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alamut</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">5</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow to be a Tatar, yet too dark for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Georgian, her head was poised gracefully on</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender shoulders.

Under</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khlit's gaze she scowled. Abruptly she</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped to his side and watched him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">frank curiosity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you leave courtesy outside when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you enter a dwelling, Cossack?" she de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded. "You come unbidden, with dirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">boots, and you flourish your curved sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of Toctamish who would have killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">you because he is crafty as a Kurdish far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sang, and feared you. I do not fear you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You have a soiled coat and you carry a foul</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick in your mouth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Khlit grunted in distaste.

An old, gray owl."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toctamish made no reply, eying Khlit</seg><seg type="columnLine">sullenly. Khlit was fast recovering from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his surprise at the daring of this woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a race he had not seen before, and very</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful, who seemed without fear. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter of a chieftain, he meditated;</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely she was one brought up among many</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, daughter," he responded moodily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Gray, and therefore forbidden to ride with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the free Cossacks, my brothers of the Siech.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wherefore am I alone, and my sword at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">service of one who asks it.

The black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed woman stared at him boldly, head on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one side. "Did you truly enter here in</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace, seeking only food?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye," said Khlit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait, then," said she, "and the nameless</seg><seg type="columnLine">one whose house this is will prepare it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you.

The argument seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be about himself. Also, he heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name Berea repeated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although Khlit was not of a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature, the identity of the girl puzzled him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the beauty of a high-priced slave,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the manner of a king's daughter, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">went unveiled in a land where women</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered their faces from men. Moreover</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was young, being scarce eighteen, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of delicate stature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Khlit bethought him, and it crossed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory that he had heard of dark-haired</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fair-skinned women of unsurpassed</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty whose land was at the far end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sea of Khozar, the inland, salt sea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were Persians, of the province of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rudbar.

Toctamish, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">meditated, was not one who could invent</seg><seg type="columnLine">answers to questions out of his own wit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Either he spoke the truth, or he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully taught what to say. Khlit was</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-satisfied that the girl's and the Tatar's</seg><seg type="columnLine">story was true in all its details, strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it seemed. Yet he was wise, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisdom of years, and certain things troubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not customary for a Tatar of rank</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow the leadership of a woman. Also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not clear why Berea should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been so eager for the services of Khlit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Wolf. Again, she had declared that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Old Man of the Mountain was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be met with, yet, apparently, she sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pondering these things, Khlit tapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly on the door of the girl's cabin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no response and he listened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From within he could hear the quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing of a person in sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had come to speak with Berea, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was loath to turn back. Pushing open</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door he was about to step inside, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Full length on the floor lay Berea, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue cloak she always wore. Her black</seg><seg type="columnLine">curls flowed over a silk pillow on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head rested. Her eyes were closed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face so white that Khlit wondered it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever been pink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What drew the Cossack's gaze were two</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects on the floor beside her. Khlit saw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so close that some of the dark hairs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught in them, two daggers sticking up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right on either side of the girl's head. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">daggers were curved, like a tongue of fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Khlit's glance, roaming quickly about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin, told him that no one else was there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berea had not carried two weapons of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">size. Another had placed them there. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">he noticed the silk cushion, he remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Syrian silk-merchant who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Berea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a muttered curse of surprise, Khlit</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped forward, treading lightly in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy boots. Leaning over the girl he</seg><seg type="columnLine">scanned her closely. Her breathing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet and regular, and her clothing un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbed. Seeing that she was asleep, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cossack turned his attention to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Drawing the latter softly from the wood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he retreated to the door. Closing this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he climbed to the deck and scanned it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Syrian merchant. Almost within reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw the one he sought, in a group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">several ragged traders, squatting by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail of the ship. No one noticed him, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">black sheepskin hats bent together in</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnest conversation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the daggers under his arm, Khlit</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaggered over to the group, the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking up silently at his approach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey, infidel dogs," he greeted them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Here is a pair of good daggers I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">IO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lying by the steps. Who owns them?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Speak!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  His eye traveled swiftly over the brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces. None of the group showed interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond a curl of the lips at his words. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had expected the owner to claim his</seg><seg type="columnLine">property, he was disappointed. The Syrians</seg><seg type="columnLine">resumed their talk together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So be it," said Khlit loudly. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are useless to me. Away with them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Balancing the weapons, he hurled them</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the deck. As he did so, he glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the traders. Their conversation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">uninterrupted. Yet Khlit saw one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">group look hastily after the flying daggers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was only a flash of white eyeballs in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lean face, but Khlit stared closer at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow, who avoided his eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Something in the man's face was familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Cossack. Khlit searched his memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smiled to himself. The man who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the fate of the daggers Khlit had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen in Astrakan. The man had changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his style of garments, but Khlit was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasonably sure that he was no other than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Syrian armorer who had offered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shop to Berea and Toctamish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Fingering his sword, the Cossack hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated. It was in his mind to ask at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword's point what the other had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing in Berea's cabin. Yet, if the fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitted he had left the daggers by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">' girl, and Khlit did not kill him, the Syrian</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be free to work other mischief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Khlit, careless as he was of life, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see no just reason for killing the Syrian.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Better to let the man go, he thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unaware that he was suspected, and watch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As an afterthought, Khlit went to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the twisted daggers lay on the deck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw them over the side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE YEAR of the lion, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a drouth around the Sea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khozar, and the salt fields of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">south shore whitened in the sun.

The girl's voice was low, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">words trembled with passion and the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes that peered at the Cossack over her</seg><seg type="columnLine">veil were dry as with fever, and burning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Halen ibn Shaddah shall pay for his evil;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he is cursed in the sight of Allah.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wicked--wicked beyond telling is Alamut</seg><seg type="columnLine">and therefore cursed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Chirp shrilly, little Sparrow," laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khlit, "while your white throat is still</seg><seg type="columnLine">unslit.

One or two Kurds gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look at its contents. Among the group</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khlit noticed Toctamish who had come up</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly. The Tatar pushed past the others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heedless of their muttered curses until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood directly in front of the trader. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Syrian looked up, and, seeing Toctamish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was motionless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Khlit saw the Kurds stare and draw back</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if they sensed trouble. The Syrian,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still watching Toctamish, rose with a swift,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat-like movement, his hand hidden in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silks.

Around him a crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed, watching with attention. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry, the Syrian, who seemed to have found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the suspense too much for him, drew a pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the silks in which it had been con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cealed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly two giant arms were flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">'round him.

Writhing impotently, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Syrian saw Toctamish draw a dagger from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his girdle. And Khlit grunted as he noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was the one he had seen with blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a curved flame. While he held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller man powerless with one arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toctamish lifted the dagger and thrust it</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully into his foe's body, into stomach</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, rising, he wiped the curved dagger</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a handful of the trader's silks. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment the arms and legs of the unhappy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Syrian stirred on the ground. And Khlit</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a strange thing. For, before life had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone from the body, several men of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">caravan, Khirghiz warriors by their dress,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed through the throng with daggers</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that of Toctamish and struck at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Syrian. Not until the body was still did</seg><seg type="columnLine">they cease to strike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the Khirghiz men looked around for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toctamish, but the stocky Tatar had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared in the throng. Khlit, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed nothing of what happened, thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself that it was well that the dagger</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been in the hand of Toctamish, not of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Syrian. Plainly, he thought, the Khir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghiz murderers had been fellows, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing, to the Syrian. And he wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">how men of many races came to be banded</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, not knowing that he was to wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon, and very greatly, at other things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BERCA had disappeared; and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khlit strode through the crowd of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the caravan seeking her, his horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his elbow, he met Toctamish. The Tatar</seg><seg type="columnLine">was mounted and leading the pack-mule.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mount," he said gruffly, "and follow."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And what of the girl!" queried Khlit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was unwilling to take orders from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toctamish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She has told us to go on, as you know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">caphar," snarled the Tatar, who disliked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk.

It was advancing swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward them, and the Cossack could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was made by mounted men riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">very fast. He made out turbans and spear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">points in the dust. The horsemen were</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed directly toward the caravan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Robbers-," said Toctamish briefly;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"there will be a fight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A poor one, it seems," growled Khlit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Kurds are leaving us as fast as their</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses can take them and your countrymen</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the looks of things little--they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">not drawn sword or bow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In truth, the Tatars who were acting as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alamut</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">guard, sat their horses stolidly, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismayed traders added to the confusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">by rushing about frantically, trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">assemble their goods. Khlit turned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention, in disgust to the oncoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">horsemen, and counted a bare two score.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In numbers, the caravan was three times</seg><seg type="columnLine">as strong; yet no attempt at defense was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead the traders were anxiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">spreading out their bales of goods, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all were displayed. Camels and donkeys</seg><seg type="columnLine">were stripped and their burden placed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground. In the meantime the horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who had come up were trampling</seg><seg type="columnLine">recklessly through the confusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A fat Greek merchant held out an armful</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rugs to one of the riders who stared at it</seg><seg type="columnLine">insolently and pointed to the heavy packs</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the merchant. Other riders jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the contents of these packs, and ranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in nine piles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Khlit, watching them, saw that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were men of varied race. He guessed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Persian, Kurd, Circassian, Turk and others</seg><seg type="columnLine">with whom he was not familiar--dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skinned, and heavily-cloaked who sat their</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses as a swallow rides the wind. Also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Khirghiz men of the caravan had joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">the newcomers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first rider flung some words at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greek who was cowering on the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Khlit thought he caught the phrase</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Alamut." Then the horsemen picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of the nine piles of goods, and flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">them over pack-horses. Other riders who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been similarly occupied joined them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All the while the Tatar guardians of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">caravan watched without interest, as men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had seen the like before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not until the horsemen were well</seg><seg type="columnLine">away over the salt plain that Khlit recov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered from his astonishment at the sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">few robbing many.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better the mountain-folk than these,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he growled, spitting in the direction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">merchants who were putting their goods</seg><seg type="columnLine">away amid lamentations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it came to pass that a Cossack rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the foothills of Rudbar where, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">words of the historian Abulghazi, none set</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot who held Allah or Christ for their true</seg><seg type="columnLine">God, and with him rode a Tatar who, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">other circumstances would gladly have slain</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They rode in silence, as rapidly as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack animal could move, and by nightfall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had gained the edge of the salt deposits</seg><seg type="columnLine">that made that part of Persia like a frozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each made camp after his fashion. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">two fires were lighted instead of one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khlit produced some barley cakes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wine and made a good meal. Toctamish</seg><seg type="columnLine">took some raw meat from under his saddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had placed it for seasoning and</seg><seg type="columnLine">washed it down with his favorite arak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both kindled pipes and sat in silence in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toctamish's pipe went out first, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khlit knew that the Tatar had swallowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smoke until with the burning arak he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lost consciousness. The Cossack was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His sleep was unbroken, except that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">near dawn, he thought he heard the tramp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling of many horses' feet, which sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the rays of the sun, slipping into liis</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, awoke him. He made out at some dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance the track of a cavalcade in the dust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and considered that it might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a caravan. Yet it was out of the path of</seg><seg type="columnLine">caravans. Moreover, he was reasonably</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure the track had not been there the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. Toctamish, when wakened, yawned</seg><seg type="columnLine">in bad spirits and told Khlit he was an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, of great fear and unmentionable</seg><seg type="columnLine">descent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they resumed their path, it led</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward through the foothills of Rudbar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A few date trees and some thorn bushes</seg><seg type="columnLine">lined the way, but for the most part there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was little foliage and many rocks. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass, however, was good, and this was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, the reason why groups of horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">were met with under the care of single,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted horsemen who watched Khlit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his companion with curiosity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They rode apart and silently, as before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khlit's thoughts dwelt on Berea's last</seg><seg type="columnLine">words. The girl had spoken as one having</seg><seg type="columnLine">authority. She was no ordinary sheik's</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter, living out of sight of men, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. She was daring, and he wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">if she came from one of the hill-tribes where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the women ride with men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Berea had told him they were in the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Halen ibn Shaddah, in the territory</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Refik folk, yet Khlit saw no signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a town or city. He did see the tracks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitudes of horses in the mountains</seg><seg type="columnLine">where caravans were unknown. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses themselves puzzled him. For he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see nothing of their riders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toctamish, apparently, wasted no</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought on his surroundings. He rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">warily, but kept his thoughts to himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pressed onward rapidly. Thus it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the two came to a wide, shallow river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and followed the bank along a valley that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to sink further into the hills as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they advanced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Until sunset they rode, making detours</seg><seg type="columnLine">to avoid waterfalls and fording the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it curved--for it was very shallow--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then Khlit who was in the lead came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a halt as they rounded a bend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the bones of Satan," he swore, "here</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the place Berea told us of. Devil take</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, if it does not look like a dog with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">front paws in the river."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like an arched bow the river curved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the two riders standing at the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bow looking inward. Across from</seg><seg type="columnLine">them rose a high point of rock, serried and</seg><seg type="columnLine">overgrown with bushes, several hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. No trees were on the summit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock. Instead, Khlit could make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses of stones tumbling together and</seg><seg type="columnLine">overgrown. A few pillars stood up through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the debris.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Around the summit ran the semblance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a wall. So great was the waste of stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was hard to see any semblance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">order in it, but Khlit judged that a citadel</seg><seg type="columnLine">as big as a good-sized town had Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowned the dog-promontory. The rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">jutted out to make the massive head of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast, and ridges suggested paws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here is no Alamut, Toctamish," growled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khlit in disgust. "Truly, we are fools--•</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little sparrow, Berea, has made game</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait, caphar," retorted Toctamish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismounting. "She said we would find the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog sitting in the river, thus, and we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it. We will wait here and see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">happens."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, we will wait," laughed Khlit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and see if the dog will give birth to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LITTLE Khlit suspected how true</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chance word was to be.- The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun had dropped behind the furthest</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain summit, and the night cold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the high elevation had wrapped around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two watchers when they saw a sight that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made their blood stir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Cossack had stretched on the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little distance from Toctamish, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">subsided into snores. He watched the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">light melt from the ruins on the summit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliff, and as he watched he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard echoes from across the river, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">from far off. Straining his ears, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch bursts of music and shouting. Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membering his experience with the horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">the previous night, he wondered if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains were playing tricks with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sounds would come in bursts as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though a gate had been opened to let them</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, followed by silence. Khlit was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">at home in the hills, and he did not recognize</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peculiar resonance of echoes. What he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought he heard were songs and shouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated from mouth to mouth, as by</seg><seg type="columnLine">giants, in the heart of the rock opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lighting his pipe and cursing himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a dreaming fool, Khlit sat up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scanned the darkness over the river. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">if to mock him, the burst of shouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">became clearer. And then the skfa moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">along Khlit's back of its own accord and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jaw dropped. He shook his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">angrily, to make sure he was still awake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of the rock across the river a multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude of lights were flickering. The lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">came toward him rapidly, and the shouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew. There were torches, moving out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, and by their glare he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mass of moving men armed with spears</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bows.

One, very lean and dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">of face, dressed in a white coat bossed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold, and wearing a tufted turban of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same colors, spoke in a tongue Khlit did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey, brothers," swore Khlit genially,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alamut</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing, for the presence of danger pleased</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, "have you any who speak like Chris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians?

A circular opening formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the ceiling, and through this</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could see the stars and the velvet vault</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two of the dark-faced men, strange to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khlit, like the Dai of white and gold, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the wall, wearing mail and resting on</seg><seg type="columnLine">spears. A small ebony table was loaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with parchments and instruments which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cossack had never seen before.

The Dai</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowned and fingered a dagger at his girdle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khlit drew his curved sword and stood over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white cloths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell Rashideddin, Iba Kabash," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"what this othfir shroud is for."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What--how do you mean?" muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kurd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is for the man who first tries to kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, dog," snarled Khlit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The astrologer bent over the chessboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">impassively. Apparently he was blind to</seg><seg type="columnLine">what passed in the room and to the words</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Iba Kabash. The others watched him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was silence. Until Rashideddin</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his head suddenly and compressed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale Ups.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You fool," he smiled, "blunderer of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steppes! This is not Russia. Here there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is one law, *and punishment; murder!</seg><seg type="columnLine">See!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pointed a white hand at one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mailed Tatars. The man started forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drew back shivering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kill thyself, fellow," said Rashideddin</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Tatar stared at him and cast a help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less glance around the room. Khlit saw his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand go to his girdle and tremble</seg><seg type="columnLine">convulsively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fedaviel" the astrologer's voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentle, "show the Russian our law. By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oath of the Refik, kill thyself!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a grunt of sheer terror the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped his spear. His right hand rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the girdle, gripping a dagger curved</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a flame. Rose, and sank into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat. With the hilt of the dagger wedged</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his chin, the Tatar sagged to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, quivered and was still. One blood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stained hand had fallen among the chess-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was silence in the room for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, broken by Toctamish. The Tatar</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped to Khlit's side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You and I are brothers, Cossack," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled, "and your danger is my dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rashideddin, who had given a sigh of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure at the death of the attendant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied the disordered chessmen impas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sively. The Dai sprang to his feet with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">oath. For several heart-beats no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved. Iba Kabash stared in fascination</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a red pool which had formed under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead Tatar's head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vni</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">?.TM3 THE astrologer, apparently giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bmla lIP as hopeless the attempt to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">place the chessmen, stood up. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khlit, who was watching, wondered at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure. The man was bent so that his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the form of a bow. His head stuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, pale as a fish's belly, topped by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red skullcap. His gray cloak came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground. Yet when he moved, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a soft quickness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see," he said, as if nothing had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened, "the oath of Alamut--obedience,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stirred the shroud contemptuously</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his foot. Then, as if arriving at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">decision, he turned to Iba Kabash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take these clowns to the banquet-place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and give them food. See that they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">not harmed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that he motioned to the Dai and</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreated through one of the recesses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toctamish wiped his brow on which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">perspiration had gathered and touched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead man with his foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The good Rashideddin will not kill you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanted the Kurd eagerly. "It must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a miracle, for you are both fools. You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to thank for your safety. I have given</seg><seg type="columnLine">good advice, have I not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toctamish eyed him dubiously. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not feel oversure of safety. Khlit, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, whispered to him. Rashideddin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the man to play with them if he desired</seg><seg type="columnLine">their death. It might be that the astrol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oger's words were in good faith--Khlit</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned later that the latter never troubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lie--and if so they would gain nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lose much by staying where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it happened that both warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheathed their swords with apparent good</seg><seg type="columnLine">grace and followed Iba Kabash who led</seg><seg type="columnLine">them through empty rooms until they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out on a balcony overlooking the banquet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">place of Alamut. And Khlit was little</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared for what he saw now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The warm wind touched their faces again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Iba Kabash pointed up. In the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lofty ceiling of the place a square open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing let in the starlight. A crescent moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">added to the light which threw a silver sheen</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the great floor of the hall. Toctamish</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted in surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first it seemed as if they were looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the camp of an army from a hillside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alamut</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">19</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dozens of fires smoldered on the floor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">below them, and a hundred oil lamps</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sprinkled the intervening space. About</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the lamps men were lying, around small</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tables on which fruit, wine and dishes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">massed. A buzz of voices echoed down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the hall, and Khlit was reminded of bees</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stirring about the surface of a hive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The sound of eating and drinking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drowned the noise of voices. Along the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stone balcony where they stood other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tables were placed with lamps. Numerous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dark figures carried food and drink to these</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">h and carried away the refuse left at other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tables.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Slaves," said the Kurd, "captives of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Refik. Let us find a table and eat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It is a lucky night that I met you, for I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shall go into the paradise of Alamut."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Khlit paid little attention to the last</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> phrase. Later, he was to remember it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Being very hungry he sat down with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toctamish at a convenient table and took</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> some of the bread and roasted meat which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> he found there. Toctamish was less re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> strained, and gulped down everything with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> zest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As he ate Khlit considered his com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">panions, and the banquet-place. All of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them, he noticed, seemed drowsy, as if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drunk, or very gay. In the lamplight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their faces showed white. They lay in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heaps about the tables, sometimes one on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   To the Cossack drunkenness was no sin,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> yet there was something about the white</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> faces and limp figures of the men that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> stirred his blood. And the smell of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> place was unpleasant, a damp, musky odor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> seemed to rise from the hall under them,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> as of beasts. Piles of fruit lay rotting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> about the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "It is time," chattered the Kurd, who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was sipping at a goblet of wine, "Halen ibn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Shaddah showed himself. He comes to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the banquet-place every night, and we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drink to him. Drink, Khlit--are not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Cossacks born with a grape in their mouths?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You are lucky to be alive, for Rashideddin</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is a viper without mercy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Who is this Rashideddin?" asked Khlit,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> setting down the wine, for it was not to his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> liking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Oh, he is the wise man of the arch-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">prophet--the master of Alamut. He knows</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more magic than all the Greeks and der-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vishes put together. He reads the stars,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and tells our master when it is time to send</seg><seg type="columnLine">out expeditions. They say he has servants</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every city of the world. But I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">he learns everything from the magic</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands." Iba Kabash's tongue was out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripping his wit. "There is nothing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes on in Persia and Tartary that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">does not see. How did he know you wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cross?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He saw the chain at my neck, fool,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">retorted Khlit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He began to feel strangely elated. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had only a little wine, but his head was</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling and he had a curious languor in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his limbs. The trouble extended to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, for as he looked at the banquet-place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed to have grown wider and lighter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could see that Toctamish was half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconscious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus it was that Khlit, the Wolf, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banquet-place of Alamut came under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence of the strange evil that gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place. And came to know of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">wickedness, which set Alamut apart from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world, as with a curse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Khlit, turning the situation over in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, saw that it was best to play the part</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had taken on himself. He doubted if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were possible to escape past the guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the river stairway, even if he could free</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself from the guardianship of Iba</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kabash. Rashideddin, he felt, had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">left his visitors unwatched. Also, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious to see further of the strange world</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Alamut, which was a riddle of which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not found the key. He had seen a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tatar kill himself at a word from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astrologer, and Iba Kabash who was a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">without honor, speak with awe of the master</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Alamut. Who was Halen ibn Shaddah?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And what was his power over the men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alamut?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it happened, it was not long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khlit saw die man he was seeking, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he was sworn to kill. There came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pause in the murmur of talk and Iba</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kabash clutched his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look!" he whispered. "Here is Sheik</seg><seg type="columnLine">Halen ibn Shaddah, who will choose those</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go into paradise tonight. You are new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comers in Alamut and he may choose you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereon I shall follow behind without</seg><seg type="columnLine">being seen. Pray that his eye may fall on</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, for few go to paradise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Across the banquet-place, on the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">balcony, Khlit saw a group of torches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bearers were Dais. In the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">20</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the torches stood a tall man, dressed as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dais except that he wore no turban, a cloak</seg><seg type="columnLine">covering his head, drawn down so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing could be seen of his face. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheik's shoulders were very broad and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands that rested on his girdle were</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Khlit watched, Halen ibn Shaddah</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved along the balcony among the eaters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the banquet floor a murmur grew into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shout--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Blessed be he that has unmade all laws;</seg><seg type="columnLine">who is master of the akd; chief of chief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">prophet of prophets, sheik of sheiks; who</seg><seg type="columnLine">holds the keys of the gate of paradise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Iba Kabash shouted as if in ecstacy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising on his knees and beating his palms</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, as the group of the sheik came</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer them. Once or twice Khlit saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Halen ibn Shaddah beckon to a man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose hastily and followed the Dais. Iba</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kabash, he thought, was drunk, yet not</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a fashion known to Cossacks. Klilit</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself felt drowsy, although clear in mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw that the noise had wakened Toc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tamish who was swaying on his haunches</seg><seg type="columnLine">and muttering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Halen ibn Shaddah stood over them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Khlit thought that one of the Dais</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered to him. The Cossack had fast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened his gaze greedily on the cloaked face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he wished to see the face of the master</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Alamut. He could make out only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, dark countenance, and eyes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed much white. Vaguely he remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered that he had seen others who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces like that, but he could not think who</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were. The sight of Halen ibn Shaddah</seg><seg type="columnLine">affected him like the foul smell of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banquet-place and the rat-eyes of Iba</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kabash. Halen ibn Shaddah beckoned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and Toctamish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Klilit supported his companion to his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but found that the wine had taken away</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his own strength. Hands, belonging,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he suspected to slaves, helped him after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white • figures of the Dais. They passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the banquet-place through passages</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could see only dimly. The torch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light vanished, and there came a silence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was broken by music, very sweet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khlit's head was swimming strangely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he felt himself moving forward through</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness. Darkness in which the music</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoed, being repeated softly as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the voices repeated when they first</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into the passages of Alamut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IF IT was a dream, Klilit asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, why should he be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">taste the red wine that trinkled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down his throat? Yet if it were not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream, why should a torrent of the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">wine issue from a rock? And sunlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">burn on the red current, when Klilit was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passages of Alamut, under the ground?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Truly, it must be a dream, he thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed that he was lying on his side</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the flowing wine, with the sun warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his face. Whenever he wanted to drink,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not need to sit up, for he raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and a girl with flowers around her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and breast came, and filled some</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel which she held out to him. Khlit</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very thirsty and the wine was good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl, he felt, sat by him, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger-nails and the soles of her bare feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">were red. He had never seen such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">maiden, for her hair also was red, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun glinted through it as she drew it across</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face. Her hair must be perfumed, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, like the harlots of Samarkand, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it smelled very good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The music came to his ears from time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, and he snorted, for Khlit was no lover</seg><seg type="columnLine">of soft sounds. Neither did he fully relish</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wine, which was oversweet. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">well content to be in the sun, and too</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowsy to wonder how it happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dream, if it was that, changed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khlit was in a boat lying on some rugs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boat was drifting along a canal. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to tune it would pass under a porcelain</seg><seg type="columnLine">kiosk, tasselled and inlaid with ivory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From these kiosks girls laughed down at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and threw flowers. One of the tinted faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like Berea's, and Klilit thought then it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was surely a dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One other thing he remembered. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a grove of date trees where young boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran, shouting, and pelted each other with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fruit. In spite of the warmth and pleasant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, Khlit felt very tired. He was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade of one of the date trees with his sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">across his knees. The music was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint here, for which he was glad. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed very wakeful. The air was clear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looking up he could see the sky, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween jagged walls of stone. He had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">other walls of stone like these. That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he and Toctamish had stood at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shahrud looking up at the dog rock that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Alamut.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alamut</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">21</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even in the dream, Khlit felt ill. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the damsel of the red hair and flowers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beckoned to her, for he was thirsty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She ran away, probably at the sight of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword. Khlit felt angry, for she had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">him drink for what seemed many years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he saw the gray-cloaked figure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rashideddin, the astrologer of Alamut,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside him, and the white face stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him until Khlit fidgeted. He heard Rashid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eddin speak, very faintly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where art thou?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Khlit was too tired to answer at first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know not," he said finally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thou art in paradise, and by favor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Halen ibn Shaddah. Do not forget."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Truly, Khlit had not forgotten. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were other things he remembered. Vistas</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blue pools where dark-skinned men</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathed, and date groves where bright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored birds walked, dragging their tails</seg><seg type="columnLine">on tije ground. He saw girls pass, hand in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, singing. And the music did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">cease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If it had been a dream, Khlit said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, how could the taste of the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">wine stick to his palate? Or the warmth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sun be still burning on his skin?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nay, surely it must have been a dream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the waking was disagreeable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The place where he found himself on</seg><seg type="columnLine">waking was dark, wet and smelled strongly</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wine dregs. Khlit rose to his knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously and felt about him with his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could feel the outline of something round</seg><seg type="columnLine">and moist on all sides except overhead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also he came upon the body of a man lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">by him, which he identified by its fur tunic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and peaked helmet as Toctamish. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tatar was snoring heavily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wake, Flat-Face and son of an unclean</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal," he growled, shaking him. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">are no longer in paradise. Devil take me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it ain't a wine cask."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toctamish roused at length and sat up</seg><seg type="columnLine">reluctantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it you, caphar?" he asked, stretching</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. "Many times have I been drunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">as an ox, but never such as this. May the</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil bite me, if there was ever such wine!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let us find some more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you have been dreaming, also,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">meditated Khlit. "Did you imagine that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you saw Berea?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Berea? Nay, but she said that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would visit us here. That was no dream,</seg><seg type="columnLine">caphar, for there was sunlight, and much</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">feasting. Did Rashideddin tell you it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">paradise? I met other Tatars there. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me what it was."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Were they also men who dishonored</seg><seg type="columnLine">their god at Rashideddin's bidding? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">said they concerning this paradise of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Toctamish snarled in anger, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory of the scene by the chessboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are one without brains, Cossack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it is well that we are here alive. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions said this: that all who came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alamut were admitted to the paradise by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Halen ibn Shaddah, if they were worthy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, if they were killed in the ranks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Rejik their souls returned to the para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dise. That was a lie, for how can there be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a soul in a man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Khlit said nothing. But he thought that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had found the key to the riddle. Halen</seg><seg type="columnLine">ibn Shaddah's power lay in the lusts of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. They looked on him, even so shrewd</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man as Iba Kabash, as one who held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret of paradise. And, although he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know it, Khlit's thought had come near</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the evil of Alamut, which was a plague</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot on the face of the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE next few days the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors, bound together by mutual</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest, although cordially hating</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other, made frequent explorations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chambers of Alamut. In the daytime</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight filtered in at the banquet-place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the round chamber of Rashideddin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other places, but at night the only light</seg><seg type="columnLine">was from lamps or torches. The chambers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were large enough to hold a hundred men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in each and there were many. Khlit, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had keen eyes, learned several things, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluding the place of the Refik treasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First, a certain area was guarded against*</seg><seg type="columnLine">intrusion by picked Tatars and Arabs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Into the guarded chambers he had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dais and other higher dignitaries called</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dailkebirs go, and he guessed they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied by Halen ibn Shaddah and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">court, where was kept the gold that flowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Alamut as tribute money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, there was no exit from the chambers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Alamut save by way of the stairway</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the river, which was guarded. Fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently armed bands went in and out, also</seg><seg type="columnLine">messengers of many races, but all were</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely watched. Moreover, few except old</seg><seg type="columnLine">22</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">residents of the place, like Iba Kabash, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kurd, knew the way to the river stairway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The slaves, he learned, brought food not</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the river stairway, but another source.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also wood for the fires. The warriors of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alamut, fedavie, as they were called, lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they chose, under the eyes of the Dais,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ornamenting their quarters with spoil taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">in raids or from caravans. Each man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">richly decked in whatever suited his fancy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of silks or jewels. The Dais who com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded them took interest in them only</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it was time to take an expedition out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Alamut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So much Khlit saw, and more he learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the talkative Iba Kabash, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">won some gold at dice from Toctamish, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was inclined to be friendly. The slaves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, brought the food from the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alamut away from the river, where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew it up in baskets to the summit of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall that barred all egress from the citadel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Iba Kabash had not been beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls of Alamut since his entry. Yet he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard much of the empire of the Refik that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched its power from Semarkand to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aleppo and from Astrakan to Basra. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">murderers of the Refik were feared so</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly, he explained, that tribute was</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid by the cities to Alamut. Questioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Khlit, he admitted that in numbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of the califates were superior to Alamut.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The power of Halen ibn Shaddah lay in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">daggers of his men. No enemy escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">assassination once he was marked. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">many were marked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then there is no way to leave save by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river stair?" asked Khlit, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened attentively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Iba Kabash stared and shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is the fool who would escape,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khlit?" he responded. "Thrice lucky are</seg><seg type="columnLine">we who are here. There was a calif who</seg><seg type="columnLine">marched against us with horsemen from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irak. We rained down stones and baked</seg><seg type="columnLine">clay on his men; then sallied forth, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shadrud was red with blood."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye," said Toctamish sullenly. "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are no better fighters than those of Irak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remember Hulaga Khan and his horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nay, I knew them not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Iba Kabash glanced at the Tatar curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously, and Khlit laughed to distract his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, for he did not trust the Kurd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There was another who opposed us,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued Iba Kabash. "That was a sheik</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hillmen in the mountains around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alamut. Him we killed by tearing out</seg><seg type="columnLine">his belly and bowels. He had a daughter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was a spit-fire. Rashideddin dealt</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How?" asked Khlit carelessly, recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nizing the description as Berea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cleverly, very cleverly," chuckled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kurd, rubbing his hands together. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had Halen ibn Shaddah order her off to</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry some Tatar chief who knew her not.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was when she had gone that we slew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old chief slowly, and scattered his tribe."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Truly a shrewd trick." Khlit gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toctamish a warning blow in the ribs that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the stocky warrior grunt. "How</seg><seg type="columnLine">fared the chief's daughter at the hands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tatar? Your knowledge is greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that of others, Iba Kabash. Can you</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nay, that is a hard one," laughed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kurd. "I have heard, from a slave that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief's daughter, Berea, was seen in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Astrakan. Also that she was taken as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave by some caravan not far from here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Was the one who told you a slave in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alamut?" demanded Toctamish, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming restive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where else, offspring of a donkey?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered Iba Kabash. "I suppose you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">also ask how he came to hear of the girl."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nay," interrupted Khlit. "Toctamish</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered at the power of Alamut. He is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clown. You and I, Iba Kabash, are men</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wisdom."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it happened that Khlit was not aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished when, as he came from the floor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banquet-place, one night, his head hazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the fumes of the strange wine, a girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave leaned close to him and whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">briefly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the far corner of the balcony," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated, "in an hour."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked thoughtfully at an object the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave had thrust into his hand. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sapphire which Berea had once offered him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not tell Toctamish of the message.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he was at some pains to get rid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Iba Kabash before the time appointed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the message. So he was alone when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went slowly along the stone balcony to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark corner. The slaves had retired from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the banquet-place and the fedavie were</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching for Halen ibn Shaddah to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his quarters. Standing so that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be' seen by those below, Khlit</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alamut</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">waited. Waited until the torches came,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Dais and the huge figure of Halen</seg><seg type="columnLine">ibn Shaddah. He felt a touch on his coat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Follow," whispered the soft voice of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Persian, "and do not tread clumsily."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Khlit found that this was not so easy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berea carried no light. He could barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">see her cloaked form by the reflection of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional candle as she passed swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through chambers and rock passages. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">head was light from the wine, although his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind was clear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Berea kept to passages where there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">few persons, and these Khlit saw to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaves. She was taking him through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave quarters where he had not been before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through corridors that narrowed until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to turn sideways to pass; by sunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls which smelled evilly. Through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor that led out of the chambers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alamut into the paradise of Halen ibn</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shaddah.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Klilit paused in amazement and felt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head which was throbbing. A half-moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimmered down at him, and a cofll night</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind played in his hair. The branches of</seg><seg type="columnLine">date trees stirred lazily. Under his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could feel grass, and he saw one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange birds that dragged its tail come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the shadow of the date trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Berea shook him angrily by the arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One without sense, eater of swine flesh!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she hissed. "Are you a clown to gape at</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange things?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A FOUNTAIN threw its spray on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind into Khlit's face, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scent like the roses of Ispahan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Below the fountain was a canal, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khlit remembered vaguely, with a boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">attached to the shore. In the water he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the reflection of the moon gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at him. And he was dizzy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the paradise of Halen ibn</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shaddah," he muttered unsteadily, "where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I came by his favor. So Rashideddin</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Berea peered up at him silently. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloak fell back and Khlit saw the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses of hair which fell on either shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the white throat under the curved</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark mouth that was twisted in scorn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A weak fool," she stormed, shaking him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Toctamish is a better man than you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Toctamish is drunk. Nay, little Spar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row, it is my head. It will be better pres-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ently. This is no dream. How did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to Alamut, little Berea?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For answer the girl drew Khlit, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting the dizziness in his head, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canal, and into the boat. Pushing it from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shore, she paddled in the water until it</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated into the shadows. Not content with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this Berea urged the craft along the bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly, and Khlit who was flat on his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the shadow of a bridge fall over them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nay," he said drowsily, "the stars are</seg><seg type="columnLine">good.

And, nimbly as the Kurd took</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way from the banquet-place, Khlit was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as quick to follow, keeping in the shadows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passages, but well within sight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it happened that Iba Kabash did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">see Khlit when he turned into the winding</seg><seg type="columnLine">stair that led to the room of Rashideddin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the Cossack saw him and waited by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer chamber.

Nay, he surely had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear of Halen ibn Shaddah, who held the keys</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the blessed paradise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Khirghiz swore even more fluently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a lie that Rashideddin spoke with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Halen ibn Shaddah more than others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rashideddin was favored by the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers, for he read books.

We must</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to get the girl. If you know a way tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and it shall be done. Remember, say</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to Rashideddin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Khlit weighed the words of the Kurd for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their gist of truth and foimd very little.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He little liked to face the astrologer, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascended the stair at once, swaggering, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamping his boots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the round chamber of the astrologer</seg><seg type="columnLine">he halted.

In a cleared space on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor in front of him the wise man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alamut had ranged a number of images,</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver and cleverly wrought, of stars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stars formed a circle and in the circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a bag.

Looking into them, Khlit</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see nothing. The room was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still and deserted except for the two. Khlit</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished that others had been there. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill at ease, and sucked at his pipe loudly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the place of darkness, of the spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">Munkir," said Rashideddin, "there are no</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars.

He lifted his voice in a shrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">syllable. "Aie!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly the sound was taken up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated through the corridors.

Arm's</seg><seg type="columnLine">length from Rashideddin among the Dais,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her blue cloak closely wrapped on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender form, stood Berea. Her black curls</seg><seg type="columnLine">were pushed under a fold of the cloak; her</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown eyes, darting from under fringed</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashes, swept about the gathered Refik and</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed Khlit by in unconcern. Yet he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she had seen him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No other woman was present.

Khlit followed him, keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">as close as he could without being seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently both halted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A voice called through the corridor</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly, and seemingly very near.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A man must be crafty and wise," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice of Berea came to their ears, "when</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger is 'round Ills path, else is his labor</seg><seg type="columnLine">vain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Khlit crossed himself in astonishment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a moment he had forgotten the echoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the corridors of Ala-eddin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XIV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RASHIDEDDIN went straight to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the winding stairs that led to his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment. At the foot of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs Khlit, who had traced the astrologer</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely, paused. It would not be easy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go farther without being seen. And this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khlit wanted to avoid. He believed that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Rashideddin was having him watched, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Khirghiz had attended him to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">divan under orders. And at all costs he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be free to act that night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rashideddin, thought Khlit, sensed</seg><seg type="columnLine">something impending. In some way the</seg><seg type="columnLine">magician of Alamut kept himself informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what went on in the citadel. His spies</seg><seg type="columnLine">were everywhere. And on the night when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berea planned to admit the enemies of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Refik, both were under watch. Where was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toctamish?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Khlit wasted no time by the foot of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winding stair. There were other entrances</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the circular chamber where Rashideddin</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept his henchmen, and the Cossack cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">about until he came to one of these. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage led upward, unlighted in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction he sought and this Khlit followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he came to a curtain which he sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected divided it from the chamber of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astrologer. Beyond the curtain he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear voices.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lifting one edge of the hanging, Klilit</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked out cautiously. Candle-light in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber dazzled him for a moment. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">made out a dozen figures, Rashideddin not</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them, dressed in the red and white</seg><seg type="columnLine">pf the magicians' cult. They were grouped</seg><seg type="columnLine">around a man prone on the floor. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was Toctamish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Tatar's coat and shirt had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed. Two fedavie held each of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms outstretched on the floor. His thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest was strangely red, and he gasped as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if in pain, not once or twice, but long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken gasps that shook his body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Klilit watched, startled, one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fedavie, a gaunt Tatar with a pocked face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed some brown dust on the chest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prostrate man. Khlit recognized the dust.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the same that had singed his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he sat opposite Rashideddin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thrusting aside the hanging, Klilit</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped into the room. The fedavie took</seg><seg type="columnLine">no notice of him, believing that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of Rashideddin's henchmen stationed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the passage. Toctamish, however, lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes, which gleamed as they fell on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cossack. Khlit saw that his brow was</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with sweat, and that blood ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man of the pitted face lifted some</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown powder and sifted it on the chest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his victim. Another pushed a torch into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand. Khlit realized then how his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion was being tortured. The smell</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IfiPBI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mm mm</seg><seg type="columnLine">30</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of burning in the air came from singed flesh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Toctamish was feeling the angry hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Rashideddin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Khlit stepped to the side of the fedavie</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the torch, and peered closely at Toc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tamish. He saw then what made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tatar's chest red, of a strange shade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strips of skin had been torn off over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs, and here the powder was laid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khlit swore and his hand strayed to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword. And fell to his side. The fedavie</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbered a full dozen, armed, and able-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodied. To draw his sword would be to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring ten whirling around him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Khlit had no love for Toctamish. Yet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this room the other had stood with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword drawn beside him. And they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shared bread and salt. Toctamish was</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing the torture with the stark courage</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was his creed. The lips of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufferer moved and Khlit bent closer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kiragai Khan--Khan of the Horde,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cracked lips gasped, "tell him. Blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">for blood. We have shared bread--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">salt, and arak. Tell him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Cossack nodded. Toctamish was</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking him to report how he had endured</seg><seg type="columnLine">torture to Kiragai Khan who was advancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Alamut at the head of his men, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">claiming vengeance. He was weak, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have no hope of living.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What said the dog?" muttered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fedavie with the torch who had been trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to catch what Toctamish whispered. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke in a bastard Tatar with a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">lisping. "He will not speak and Rashid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eddin has said that he must or we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">hang by the heels."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is out of his mind," answered Khlit</seg><seg type="columnLine">carelessly. "What must he tell?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He stuck a dagger into a fedavie, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Syrian, on the shore of the Salt Sea. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, Berea, the sheik's daughter, was there</seg><seg type="columnLine">also. This yellow-faced fool must tell if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl ordered him to do it. Bah!

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that Toctamish would not yield to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torture. And great love for the man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">whose courage was proof against pain rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the heart of Khlit whose own courage</seg><seg type="columnLine">was such that men called him the "Wolf."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Aye," he growled, "blood for blood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is the law of Alamut.

From some quarter the horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of Kiragai Khan were nearing the gate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Alamut. Khlit realized that unless the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack came as a surprise the citadel was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impregnable. A surprise might carry the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tatar horde into the entrance. Berea had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said there was a way. And this was it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet, if a surprise was to succeed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khirghiz must be disposed of. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been drinking, but he was still watchful.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No movement of the Cossack escaped him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quietly Khlit drew out a small vial.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From this he poured a few grains of a while</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder into his hand. Lifting his hand he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made as if to take the powder into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. The Khirghiz bent forward, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face lighted with evil desire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you--" he began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, Brother," whispered Khlit geni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, "we will be comfortable on the rocks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Is not the bread of the Refik the vintage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Shadna to be eaten? Come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Khirghiz swore softly and held out</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand. In wine and food, the vintage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Shadna was often in the hands of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Refik men. But not, except on expeditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Master of Alamut, or by costly</seg><seg type="columnLine">bribery of the Dais was the pure powder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hashish to be had, the hashish that brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright dreams of paradise and lulled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind with pleasures, that hardened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">souls of the men of Alamut, and steeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hands to the dagger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Khlit, who had discovered the secret of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drug through the babblings of Iba</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kabash, quietly dropped his portion back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the vial. Later, he knew, the Khir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghiz would want more and he had but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XIV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS not long before Khlit was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. The Khirghiz lay at his side</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the rocks, muttering to himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">with enough hashish inside him to make an</seg><seg type="columnLine">imbecile of an ordinary man. Khlit sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his side, saber across his knees, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the moonlit sides of the heights</seg><seg type="columnLine">that frowned down on him. On the slopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could make out the shadowy outlines</seg><seg type="columnLine">of droves of horses, and he wondered if the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dais were planning an expedition that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Usually, Khlit was not given to fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodings. Yet the black mass of Alamut</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising at his back gave him the feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of approaching danger, and when he scanned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadows along the river they moved as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if filled with the bands of drug-crazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">fedavie. Especially, Khlit wondered if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spies of Rashideddin were watching him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rashideddin had learned of the murder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Syrian, had connected Berea with it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Toctamish with Berea. Toctamish, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his order, had been tortured with such</seg><seg type="columnLine">devilish cruelty that even the Tatar's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortitude might break down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How much did the astrologer know of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berea's secret? Once the alarm was raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Alamut a thousand swords would block</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stairs at the river gate and the rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoists of the slaves at the rear would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn up. There were no signs of activity</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Khlit could see, but few ever saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements of the fedavie. Accustomed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was to war on the steppe, he was skeptical</seg><seg type="columnLine">of horsemen taking such a stronghold as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alamut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once the Tatar horde forced the entrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would be a battle such as Khlit had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never seen before. Himself a Cossack, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cared little whether Refik or Khan were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">victor--except that he had sworn an oath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a double oath, that the life of the Master</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Alamut, Halen ibn Shaddah, would fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his sword. Wherefore, he waited pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiently, eyes searching the road by the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the invaders might come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Berea had told him that twenty thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tatars were riding through the hills to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alamut. Yet the road was narrow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way twisted. It would be hard to move</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. And there were the horse-tenders</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the hills who would give the alarm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khlit had come to grant a grudging admira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to the sheik's daughter who had defied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Halen ibn Shaddah. But she was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rashideddin's hands, and the astrologer</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the man Khlit had marked as most</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous of the Refik.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rising suddenly, Khlit drew in his breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply. Outlined against the summit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hill he saw a horse and rider moving very</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly. The man was bent low in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle and Khlit thought he saw the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloak of the fedavie before the rider came</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the brow of the hill. Half-way down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the descent the horse stumbled and fell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">32</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Khlit saw a dark object shoot from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling horse and lie passive, clear in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlight. The messenger, if such it was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fedavie would not reach his destina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. And at the same time Khlit saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">something else. Before his eyes as if by</seg><seg type="columnLine">magic he beheld Kiragai Khan and thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands of his horsemen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Khlit, surnamed the Wolf, buckled</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight his belt and drew on his sheepskin hat</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly. There was to be a battle that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would redden the waters of the Shahrud</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, among the swords of the fedavie Halen</seg><seg type="columnLine">ibn Shaddah was to be found.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apparently there was nothing stirring</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the mountain slopes of Rudbar except</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shapes of the horse droves that drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the river as was their custom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaiting the bands of the Dais which came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out for mounts. Tonight there were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">men issuing from Alamut. And it was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">when one of the herds moved across the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the moon that Khlit saw the tips of Tatar</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmets moving among the horses, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood why the horses seemed more</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous than before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as Berea had promised, the Tatar</seg><seg type="columnLine">horde was approaching the gate of Alamut.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of the herds reached the river's edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pressed on, in the shadow of the hill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. Khlit could see the faces of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">peering at him, and catch the glint of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">spears. He gave a hasty glance at his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion. The man was sleeping heavily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Familiar with the ways of the Tatars, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cossack could guess how their whirlwind</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush into Rudbar had cut off all news being</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent to the citadel, and how, after dark, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Refik horse-tenders on the pastures had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been singled out and cut down. One had</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken away with the news that was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry the doom of Alamut, only to fall by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The foremost warriors had reached him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging closely to the sides of their horses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A low voice called out to him cautiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are the Cossack who will guide us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye," said Khlit, "but the moon is</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright here and there are others within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">caverns. Are you ready to rush forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lead," said the voice, "and we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow. Lead us to the gate of Alamut and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will purge the devil's hole of its filth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Khlit cast a quick glance at the hillsides.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Other bodies were moving down. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">were nearly at the river. Thousands were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">coming over the hillcrest. More were</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming by the river road. On the far</seg><seg type="columnLine">flanks detachments were moving to the rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Alamut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Drawing his sword, he sprang down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river and splashed toward the shore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dark forms closed in beside him, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome stench of sweat and leather filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nose. The river was full of moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms, and horses that dashed, riderless, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side. Khlit's heart leaped, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clasp tightened on his sword. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foremost caught him roughly by the arm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khlit had a quick glimpse of a dark, lined</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and flashing eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am Kiragai Khan, Cossack. Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">is Toctamish? He was to stay by the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Berea!".</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She sent him to watch with me. Yet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">very likely he is dead by now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other swore, as they gained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter of the caverns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take me to her, then," he snarled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it happened that before the light of</seg><seg type="columnLine">day touched the date trees on the summit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alamut, citadel of the Refik, and place of</seg><seg type="columnLine">plague and evil, the first of the horde that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ridden from the shores of the Salt Sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the river gate, overcoming a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards, forced their way up the stair, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread through the passages of Alamut,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making no sound but silently, as tigers</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking their prey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE annals of Abulghazi it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">written how, in the year of the lion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the doom of Alamut. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Refik folk were cornered in the cellars of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the citadel, and taken by surprise. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">swords of the Kallmark Tatars flashed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passages, and their sharp arrows sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the corridors. And, as the proph-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ecy said, the waters of the Shadrud were red.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet in the book of Abulghazi and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">annals of the Persian dynasties there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing said of the fate of Halen ibn</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shaddah who was the last leader of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Refik. The followers of Kiragai Khan</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought through Alamut from the wine</seg><seg type="columnLine">chambers to the gardens among the ruins</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the summit, and they did not find</seg><seg type="columnLine">Halen ibn Shaddah.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The battle was not over for many hours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Separate bands of mounted Tatars had</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded the height on which Alamut</seg><seg type="columnLine">\</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Alamut</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">33</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, and when throngs of slaves, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eunuchs with the houris of the gardens</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept out from hidden tunnels and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered over the wall, they were cut down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were not spared, for that was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word of Kiragai Khan. The fedavie, cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nered, and led by their Dais, rallied and</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacked the columns of invaders which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were penetrating to the heart of Alamut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Tatars without their horses and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting in the gloom of the caverns were</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a disadvantage, which was offset by</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater numbers and the leadership of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kiragai Khan. For the fedavie had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader. Messengers who sought through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tapestried apartments of the Shadna</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Halen ibn Shaddah found none but</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic-struck Daikebirs.

Within</seg><seg type="columnLine">half an hour after Buck Saunders had shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the peaceable Scotchman fifty well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed, determined men were hot on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail with Sheriff Bill Doble riding well in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lead on a big bay mare that was known</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be one of the hardest and longest trav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">elers on the range.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rusty McGee was among the Double-0</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys that Bill had selected to accompany</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He was a good rider, an excellent</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot and, with all his talk, nerve and grit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the backbone. He had been picked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest at the suggestion of "Sawbones"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawkins, foreman of the Double-O, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been irritated at Rusty's criticism of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheriff and wanted him to get ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quainted with Bill Doble at close range.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In this, the code of the cow-country was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being followed to a nicety--the code which</seg><seg type="columnLine">never seeks to change a man's opinions by</seg><seg type="columnLine">argument, but leaves it to the more em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phatic school of experience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Straight out across the Mesa Perdita they</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode, into the purple twilight haze, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">turquoise and lavender met and mingled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with crimson and gold. At their head rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Indian Joe," an Indian trailer who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">invaluable to every posse when trails turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hard ground and aboriginal skill became</seg><seg type="columnLine">more valuable than white men's logic. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most part the men were silent, attend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing strictly to the business of conserving</seg><seg type="columnLine">their mounts across the uneven ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The only sounds were the jingle of bridles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steady drum of the horses' hoofs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rattle of mile after mile of mesquite</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the stirrup leathers, with now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then some brief comment of the trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sky, which had been lowering all</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, settled down at dusk into an ominous</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness. Little gusts of wind puffed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their faces, bringing odd desert odors. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mesquite gave way to matted chaparral</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the jaws of Dead Man's Canon closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in upon them. Clothespin Mills sniffed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air like a hound and muttered to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What say?" chirruped Latigo Jones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging in his saddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Rain cornin'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's goin' to be nice ridin' tonight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure is.

Me--I'm doin' a heap o' thinkin'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Rusty McGee had been an interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">listener to the conversation.

Besides, there's hot grub ahead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'm strong for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The posse was in the canon now. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">way was narrow and the little band strung</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in single file, picking its way among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulders with difficulty. The work de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded their full attention and conversa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion lapsed. An hour's laborious riding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they came out of the upper end. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights of the Johnson ranch were just visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the sudden night when the rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtook them. By the time they reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the friendly shelter of the ranch build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, the water was pouring down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">torrents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The severity of the shower changed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aspect of things. The boys turned their</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired animals into the corral and clattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the ranch-house, where Johnson, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">owner of the place, gave them a cordial</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fan up old Betsy," he said, jerking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumb toward a cast-iron stove in the mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle of the living-room. "I'll tell the Chink</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hunt out some chuck steak and a pan</seg><seg type="columnLine">of soda biscuits. Some rain, ain't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The posse needed no second invitation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They stoked the fire, spread out their wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing and thawed themselves into some</seg><seg type="columnLine">semblance of comfort. By the time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feed was ready, everybody was in better</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirits. Buck Saunders became a remote</seg><seg type="columnLine">wraith of rain and storm, to be forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">until tomorrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You ain't calculatin' on goin' on to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, are you?" asked the ranch-owner, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they pushed back their plates and felt for</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipes and cigaret papers. The sheriff shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head morosely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No use," he replied. "Trail's plumb</seg><seg type="columnLine">washed out. We'll hit it up at dawn."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boys gave a sigh of relief. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to round up the outlaw. But trail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through wet adobe in a pelting rain was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty disagreeable. There was little</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance they would overtake him with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark in his favor. There would be better</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity with the daylight. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a chance then of being seen by a pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing herder or cowman. That would start</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fresh trail. There was plenty of time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They do not ride to a kill in one day ,on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">range. It is persistence and not the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">element that counts in a desert man-hunt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So they settled down to the intricacies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stud poker in the bunk-house with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropers from the ranch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT DAWN the following morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with freshened mounts under saddle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the posse swung upward into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foothills. The sky had cleared and every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was new-washed and fresh. A lilac</seg><seg type="columnLine">haze hung along the upper levels and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance the rugged outlines of Big Eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">Butte stood out in relief like a sharp-cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">cameo. The little cavalcade wound its</seg><seg type="columnLine">way across the steaming earth, discarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">known trails for less frequented roads, most</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely to show a sign of the man they</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll bet a squaw-hitch he turned off at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that water-hole," snapped Rusty McGee, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing irritation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listens reasonable," opined Clothesipn</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mills. "Reckon we might take a look</seg><seg type="columnLine">'round on the way back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly, when late in the day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sheriff Doble finally backtracked toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, after hours of fruitless search through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "bad lands" of the mesa, the two cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys dropped behind the rest. When they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the water-hole they turned into an</seg><seg type="columnLine">arroyo past a salt-lick, to where green stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprouting from the earth gave indication</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hidden water. A brief space and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to the hole itself, its edge stippled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">innumerable cattle tracks running in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">directions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rusty jumped from his horse and studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground closely. Clothespin hooked one</seg><seg type="columnLine">knee over his saddle-horn and rolled a cig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aret. As he licked his wheat-straw into</seg><seg type="columnLine">position, a sudden exclamation from Rusty</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him to the red-headed roper's side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look," said Rusty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">40</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He indicated the mark, of a shod horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sand. Beside it was the print of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's boot--a high-heeled, Mexican boot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the type ropers wear to give a firm an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chorage in the ground. Clothespin followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">McGee's outstretched finger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's Buck, sure as shootin'," said Rusty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand shaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Humph!" ejaculated Clothespin, bend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down for a closer inspection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rusty continued:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He got off here for somethin', gave his</seg><seg type="columnLine">animile just time to water and then kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a-goin'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Head down, he began' to circle like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hound. Suddenly he swung off abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the bed of the arroyo to a clump of</seg><seg type="columnLine">underbrush. Gun in hand, he stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the bushes, Clothespin Mills at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">elbow. Directly under a cottonwood tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">a horse was tethered by a slim correa with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single knot. The animal whinnied as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men came into view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Buck's hoss," exclaimed Clothespin, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth close to Rusty McGee's ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stood silent and tense--listening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was only the faint rustle of small</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground-animals scurrying through the dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches underfoot. Rusty waved the nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his weapon at the animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He changed animiles here," he com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented. "This here is the one he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridin' when he plugged Mac."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two cowboys crept out into the open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">alert for possible ambush. But they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmolested. Earth trampled down by</seg><seg type="columnLine">restless hoofs and tracks running east and</seg><seg type="columnLine">west told the story to their trained eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was as Rusty had said. The outlaw had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied an extra animal at the water-hole for</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergencies. Riding to the utmost limit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his horse's speed, he had gained sufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">headway to give the beast a drink and</seg><seg type="columnLine">change saddles. This done, he had ridden</seg><seg type="columnLine">away again on a fresh mount, more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">match for the jaded posse behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rusty glanced along the bed of the arroyo</seg><seg type="columnLine">where an ordinarily dry bed had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">a creek from the downpour of the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ain't no use in tryin' to foller him</seg><seg type="columnLine">now," he said.

There was conviction in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tone. "He's too foxy to walk into any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing like that.

"The next time I'm gonna use my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own judgment--and not some other hom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bre's." He flung the last with sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">venom.

His standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still further enhanced when the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">law, emboldened by his first success, held</seg><seg type="columnLine">up two more saloons within the course of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next fortnight. One was in Pacheco,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty miles from Grit. The other at Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barte, just across the Mesa Perdita. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">each case, Sheriff Bill Doble had gone out</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the sands at the head of a posse in</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuit. In each case he had returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty-handed and disgusted, conscious of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a growing unrest among his men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not that the posse blamed Sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill entirely. Buck was a genius for</seg><seg type="columnLine">swooping down on an unprotected or unpre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared community. In addition, he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret hiding-place somewhere in the bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands to which he always returned when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hunt grew close, and which had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet been discovered. Buck's habit was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay low in the daytime and ride only at</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. It was a combination hard to over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come in a desert country mostly wide, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded stretches of canon and valley. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">posse might ride all day and be no nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outlaw at sun-down than when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">started.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was after Buck held up and robbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank at Malona, in the middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, shot the cashier blind, and escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his booty, and the posse saddle-weary</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dusty, had returned without their man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hip Shootin'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">41</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and carrying the realization that the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">law had changed his night-riding tactics</seg><seg type="columnLine">to open defiance, that matters came to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the minute Sheriff Bill gave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to return home, after following an</seg><seg type="columnLine">aimless trail into the Mohave sand, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware that there was a change in his men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conversation dropped out entirely. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there he caught a furtive glance from</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath a hat-brim, supplemented by sul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">len mutterings and monosyllabic grunts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was not surprised when they followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into his office in Grit, and hung over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his furniture in uncomfortable attitudes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnnie Murray, foreman of the Hash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife rancho, cleared his throat and stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, aided by the urgings of several</seg><seg type="columnLine">elbows and covert glances of encourage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bill," he said, twisting his sombrero</seg><seg type="columnLine">between nervous fingers. "The boys--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is--we-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced around the room, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiving several nods of approval, gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see, Bill, it's like this.

Old Bill glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the circle. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye to meet his own. The members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">posse sat or stood in uncomfortable pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, their eyes on their feet, the ceiling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the window--everywhere, except in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his direction. Johnnie Murray was star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at a band of sunlight that came through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open window and made a pencil of yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low on the floor.

It was the one place in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the world he knew and loved best. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling dunes with their undulating out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines, the rugged sandstone outcrops that</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoved through from beneath like a giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist thrust upward; the flaming grandeur of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening skies, more beautiful than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">preacher's heaven; the fresh, fragrant mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nings with the shifting colors of the dawn--</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was all his world, his country, his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His best years had been spent there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Posse after posse he had led across the trails</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew like the lines in the palm of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.

Until the coming of Buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saunders, no outlaw in his territory had</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped the reckoning. The idea of quit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting had never entered his head. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected, of course, to die in his spurs--</seg><seg type="columnLine">most likely in the saddle. Now--they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">making it plain to him that he had failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">--"a young man's job"--Bill glanced once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more at the circle that ringed him in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a cold glint in his eyes now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So he was growing old, was he? Suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eye did hit fifty yards or so shy of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">record and his leg latches were getting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">might tight?

With all that talk on the left side</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ledger, they had a right to look for</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to strike a balance, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buck Saunders loose on the range, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew Rusty would be too busy to spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">much time in reminiscence.

Whenever Miller had spent all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he brought down from the hills, barring</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for a supply of "sow-belly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">aigs," it was always Rusty who put him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a horse and started him homeward</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the night that Buck Saunders, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlaw, made his famous display of hip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting de luxe, Rusty had left Lonesome</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack peaceably playing stud poker in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hell-Abendin' bar, and had crossed to an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other equally disreputable place across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street with a couple of Double-0 boys and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crowd from the Hashknife outfit who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been on after rustlers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had just about reached the fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink, when the sound of gun-play across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way brought them back on the run.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They found Lonesome Jack Miller lying on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor with two bullets in his stomach--</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead.

After</seg><seg type="columnLine">some circling they finally located some</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrub cottonwood, under which they hud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dled with dripping ponchos until the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking of the dawn disclosed their posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in a small arroyo which opened into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nuevo Cut. Beyond, lay Perdito Valley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">objective of the ride.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they swung their stiffened limbs to</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle, Windy Smith noticed the Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound asleep with his back against a tree.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stirred him up with his toe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wake up, ol' blubberin' Choctaw," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.

Johnnie Murray cinched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle-leather another hole and looked off</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the end of the valley. Ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">loomed Big Eye Butte, a huge granite jut</seg><seg type="columnLine">that stood out like a ruined pyramid</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a great top overlooking the flatlands</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath. Somewhere at the base of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">great pile was the rendezvous of Buck Saun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders, for whose capture, dead or alive, Rusty</seg><seg type="columnLine">McGee was taking his life in his hands. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought acted as a stimulant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Reckon we'll be movin' on," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly, and flipped his horse into action with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of his riata.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Single file, the little cavalcade wound up</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the cut, across the upper end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley toward the base of the mountain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As" they topped the rise that led down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor of Big Butte Valley, Murray sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly threw up his arm. Every rider in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party immediately sat his horse back on</seg><seg type="columnLine">its haunches. Following the foreman's out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched finger, they made out a speck</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling up the side of Big Eye Butte just</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the canon from Bone Mountain, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the ridge as to be outlined almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">in silhouette.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rusty McGee!" cried one of the party.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The foreman shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take another look," he said.

Suddenly he slap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped his leg and gave a shout of excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knowed it, I knowed it!" he exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I knowed there was something familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">about that ridin'.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">here is a short-cut along the side.

"He shore is one clever ol' coot!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently as they watched, the speck</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed the skyline of the Butte and van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished over the edge on to the plateau be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond, thence to reappear again a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later on the slight depression that dipped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greater slant of Bone Mountain. Johnnie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murray galvanized into sudden action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fellows," he said. "BUI ain't ridin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that for his health. Likewise, Bone</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mountain ain't such a bad place the which</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take a squint over the country for Rusty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I reckon we'll just take a little pasear up</seg><seg type="columnLine">there and see what's goin' on. How?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The effect of his words was electrical. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack of astonished horses were suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">roweled into life and the next instant the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowboys were tearing across the open space</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Hashknife foreman in the lead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It took them just two hours to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of the mountain--such was the condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the country through which they rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">--taking the same trail followed by Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doble on his big bay mare. When they</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally swept out oh the level plateau, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat as a table-top, they gave one look across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface and fell to swearing with all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluency with which a puncher is gifted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From edge to edge of the mile-square rect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle, there was not a sign of life!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cowboys gave their horses a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to breathe, and then, impatiently, they can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered across the level space toward the far</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge. There, on the very rim--weary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusty, their nerves and patience worn to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">raveling--they clustered in a compact knot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and peered over the edge, to find, with unex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected suddenness, spread out nearly a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand feet below, in the natural amphitheater</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Taza Caliente, a drama that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have thrilled a movie producer to the soul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Taza Caliente, as the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicates, is the "hot bowl" of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">B' extinct volcano. It is nothing more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a huge pit, resembling a natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">arena, spooned out of the hills by some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">igneous action of prehistoric days. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor of the bowl is perhaps an eighth of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile in diameter, stippled with huge gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulders and blocks of once molten rock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the center a score of tiny geysers or</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot springs of sulfurous waters, bubble out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">draining through a narrow crack in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowl, which extends off toward the south.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sides are pitted with caverns and grot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tos until the ensemble looks, as Windy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith expressed it, "like the entrance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hell with the gate left open."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There, lying on the floor on the Taza</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caliente, comfortably braced against a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulder which sheltered him from the heat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Buck Saunders. His rifle was resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his arm, conveniently located for rapid</seg><seg type="columnLine">use. His horse was nowhere to be seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the boys inferred, rightly, that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hobbled in one of the near-by caverns. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side of the outlaw was a hot spring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bubbling and simmering in the heat. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other was a hole of quicksand, deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and treacherous. The only path by which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could be reached was over the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulder toward which his rifle was pointing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some two hundred feet away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlaw, tucked behind another rock of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jagged formation was Sheriff Rusty McGee.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But what a Rusty! His hat was gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His shirt was torn half-off so that the skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed through in patches of white. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">head to foot he was plastered with dried</seg><seg type="columnLine">adobe. His face was grimed and bloody,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had fought his way through innu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merable acres of matted underbrush. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">these details the boys got later, for, stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on the edge of the overhanging butte,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all they saw at that height was the figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the red-headed sheriff worming along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">limestone bottom on his stomach toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unsuspicious Buck Saunders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gosh A'mighty," ejaculated Windy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith. "The little red-head is goin' to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">his man sure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He slapped his leg in excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'Less Buck hears him cornin'," com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented Red-eye Weeks skeptically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnnie Murray gave the speaker a ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lignant glance. Then he whipped his rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its saddle scabbard and slid to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. There came the sound of a shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliding into the discharge chamber--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then Johnnie Murray cursing softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damnation," he muttered, squinting</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the sights.

"It'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over before we get there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buck was smoking a cigaret. They could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see little puffs of smoke sail up into the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disappear. Rusty was crawling toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, dragging his rifle in the warm mud.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boys packed together in a tense group,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their eyes taking in every movement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God!" exclaimed Johnnie Murray. "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">here is gettin' on my nerves. Why don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">they start shootin'?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rusty kept up his crawling until only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock separated him from the outlaw. Leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his rifle on the ground, he drew his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver, a puncher's invariable weapon for</seg><seg type="columnLine">close work, and edged along on his elbows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was apparent to the watchers on the rim</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bowl above that he had an exact idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of where Buck Saunders was located. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was also equally apparent that the outlaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not know that a soul was within miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buck finished the cigaret he was smoking</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flipped the stub into the hot spring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he stood up, shook the sand from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes and picked up his rifle. It was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that instant that Sheriff Rusty McGee laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand on a shelf of rock that projected</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the big boulder and, in two lightning</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounds, vaulted to the top. Buck whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the sound and swung his rifle under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">armpit with one motion. Together the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two weapons shattered the silences of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steaming caldron.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rusty McGee's hat sailed across the area</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a bullet-hole through the crown. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlaw's weapon described a parabolic</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve in mid-air and sank in the quick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The exchange left Rusty in command of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation. He slid down the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock until he fronted the outlaw on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">level. Buck's back was half-turned. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood rubbing his left arm, which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">jarred numb by the impact of the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver bullet on his rifle stock. Rusty</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be talking, his weapon at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlaw's middle. They could see him ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticulate with Ills free hand. Once he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed off toward Vaca, as though he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">referring to the murder of Lonesome Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller. Of a sudden, he reached for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">handcuffs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the steel bands glittered for an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant in the sunlight, there came a quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurt of flame from under the outlaw's arm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly McGee's weapon coughed back--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single flash. The sounds came up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense little group of watchers with a hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">plop-plop that was taken up by the walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bowl and echoed and reechoed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diminuendo. For the barest fraction of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second, the two men stood motionless, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though each was awaiting the next move of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other. Then Rusty McGee curled for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward on his face, his fingers plucking at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm sand beneath him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, my God! He's got him!" moaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnnie Murray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice sounded high and cracked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old man's. The rest caught the rasp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rifle hammer as he dropped on one knee</seg><seg type="columnLine">to steady his aim. Before he could fire, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drama, that had become in the- twinkling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an eye a grim tragedy, was interrupted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buck was in the act of dropping his still</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking weapon back into its holster when</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attention was caught by a movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">high up on the side of the bowl. The boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the posse, clustered on the rim, above</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught it at the same time. There, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain sight, about three hundred feet from</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Rusty McGee lay, a silent figure on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground, stood the one man everybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that part of the country had forgotten--•</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Bill Doble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The former sheriff was mud from head</seg><seg type="columnLine">to foot. His hat was pulled low over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes to shut out the glare of the sun. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the rim, his white hair stuck out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a matted fringe. Slung over his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, English fashion, was a belt of car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tridges that glistened in the sun. In one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand he balanced his old-fashioned Colt</seg><seg type="columnLine">six-gun--the one with the notches on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle. Clearly exposed to the outlaw's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire and within easy range, he made no pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense of seeking cover as Buck Saunders</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The outlaw had just time to register the</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture when he went into action with both</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. Straight from the hip he fired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and again, the bullets tin-owing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">little flecks of dust around Bill Doble's feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The shots rippled together like the ha-ha-ha</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a machine-gun, as he sprayed a deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">hail of lead up the hillside toward his enemy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">48</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Four--six times he shot while the white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired figure before him stood motionless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then--with all the calm deliberation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man shooting down clay pipes in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallery, Bill Doble raised his old-fashioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">six-gun with its wickedly long barrel in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand as steady as the rocks that surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and with perfect precision, shot Buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saunders neatly between his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The group on the rim of the bowl above</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the bad man flounder in the sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then lie still. The wreath of smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Bill Doble's weapon hung idly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air for a moment and dissipated. After a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit, he threw out the empty shell and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to feel in his pockets for a jack-knife. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">action broke the tension. The eyes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little group met.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Reckon we might as well go down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get Rusty," said Johnnie Murray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice was unsteady, and his hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he dropped his rifle back in the saddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">scabbard was shaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GRIT was just shutting up for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night when a cavalcade of horsemen</seg><seg type="columnLine">trotted down the main street with</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Bill Doble in the lead with the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of Buck Saunders swung over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pommel of his saddle and Rusty McGee</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying dizzily in his stirrups.

Before the tax proposal the busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness had been at unusually low ebb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"straights" down to thirty-five cents on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tropic wharves, seven-handed bunches</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to eighteen cents, "sixes" rejected</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether as not worth their stem weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and returned with all smaller bunches for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quashie's family pot and pig-feed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But since the tax proposal prices had</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved steadily upward. The first week</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Rio Hacha quotations of both the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amalgamated and the Caribbean companies</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluctuated from fifty cents to fifty-five,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a tot of rum for the donkey-man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought in not less than four "straight"</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunches. The second week, while "Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant Reader" and "Pro Bono" discussed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tax up North, the islands' price went</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to sixty-five and seventy cents per</seg><seg type="columnLine">"straight" with frequent fist-fights between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the runners of Pereira and Hambridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In one such fight a scared jackass, laden</seg><seg type="columnLine">with five eleven-handed bunches--extra</seg><seg type="columnLine">"straights"--fled with its coveted load and</seg><seg type="columnLine">committed inadvertent suicide in the Rio</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hacha. And once Hambridge, irritated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">lavender floating down from westward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Pereira a soor kaboocha, which Pe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reira, ignorant of Hindustani, but sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picious, resented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The third week Hambridge's chief hench-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, Mitch-Chell, smote the Amalgama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted's chief runner in the eye, Pereira's</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had called him a "t'iefin' porpus,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is not Hindustani but has to do with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the questionable honesty of a person who</seg><seg type="columnLine">has once been in a home for paupers. Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">were arrested, but promptly released. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">police force owed both Hambridge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pereira since the last poker game--a love-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feast which occurred on the evening fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing each Banana Day, when the nights</seg><seg type="columnLine">again grew lonesome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now it was the dawn of the fourth Ba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nana Day since the tax proposal. In his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hip pocket Pereira had a written slip</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought in the night by a black boy on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mule. It was from the Amalgamaled's</seg><seg type="columnLine">boss at Port Antonio. It tersely stated his</seg><seg type="columnLine">instructions:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rio Hacha: Fifteen thousand bunches--sixes up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Average seventy-five cents--dollar limit.

The chief happened to be War-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den's father. His son, fresh from an</seg><seg type="columnLine">American college, was in Jamaica to ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve Ananzi spiders, the native and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals, and to learn the difference between</seg><seg type="columnLine">Para and Guinea grass, white yams and</seg><seg type="columnLine">afu, and particularly the difference between</seg><seg type="columnLine">a banana and a plantain. The bus ha was</seg><seg type="columnLine">expert in these matters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Warden Sr.'s message of instruction was</seg><seg type="columnLine">less formal:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buy all you can lay hands on and keep out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jail.

Show the rah-rah</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy something.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This message Hambridge studied again</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the swim, when he and the rah-rah</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy had returned to the shack. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly clear message. There was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it that should have brought a moody</seg><seg type="columnLine">frown to the busha's sun-scorched brow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He studied it, turned it over, and even held</seg><seg type="columnLine">it up to the light. Once when the Amal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gamated had been waylaying the Carib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bean's dispatch bearers, the busha himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">had written an important message with</seg><seg type="columnLine">banana-juice, which remained invisible un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til it had been laundered with a hot flatiron.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this message from Warden Sr. was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all on the surface.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow was doubtful, but Mitch-Chell was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his brother's wake, wasn't he? Mitch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chell must take care of him.

The settle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment which at morn had seemed as dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Spaniards who built it under Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sasi, was now alive with Jamaican clamor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and American hustle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wharves of the rival companies were</seg><seg type="columnLine">scenes of activity. On the piers half-clad</seg><seg type="columnLine">negroes were piling bunches of green-gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">fruit, at each pile a mulatto clerk in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense hat checking the bunches as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were passed into a whaleboat by perspiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">handlers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the doorway of the Caribbean's wharf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">building Hambridge sat under a huge pith</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet watching the battle which was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">on directly before him on the sand road.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down at the Amalgamated's wharf, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Portuguese sat complacently breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing lavender, there was, on the other hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparative order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The main road from the hills entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rio Hacha from the east, and the incoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">fruit-carriers ran the rivals' gantlet at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caribbean's wharf. Once past that point</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was agreed that the spoils were to Pe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reira. But that worthy's runners were on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the job with Hambridge's at the danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">point. Both sides yelled, cursed, cajoled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatened and tried to bribe the dazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quashie from the interior, who had ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rived with his humble donkey and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">banana patch's yield of "fit" bunches for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the week.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clashes between the rival runners, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the banana-sellers and the over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zealous banana-buyers, were so frequent</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one continuous fight was in progress.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The moment one was settled and peace</seg><seg type="columnLine">established, generous libations at Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chung's rum-counter led to renewed re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">criminations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Warden arrived on the scene he</seg><seg type="columnLine">witnessed a typical collision. A well-to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">do native planter had arrived with twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">"straight" bunches in a small dray dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">by an unhappy mule that was half-sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended between the shafts. The negro was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a newcomer to Rio Hacha, drawn thereto</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the promise of high prices.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unused to Rio Hacha methods he flayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">54</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the belligerent runners with his cowhide</seg><seg type="columnLine">whip. Failing to dislodge them from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of his dray he turned his lash upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mule, urging it out of this pandemonium.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knowing that if the dray once passed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caribbean's wharf the fruit was lost to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pereira, Hambridge's runners seized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal's head. Pereira's runners tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dislodge them. The proprietor raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms to heaven and called upon his Maker</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bear witness that he was a Baptist in</seg><seg type="columnLine">good standing and had never backslid or</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in the poorhouse--whatever these</seg><seg type="columnLine">virtues had to do with the case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the mule took a part in the affaip--</seg><seg type="columnLine">resentfully. It let loose with its hind legs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The traces broke; a shaft cracked. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes later Pereira got the mule and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sections of harness. Hambridge's men bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled in the dust with the rival runners for</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession of the fruit. That which sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vived undamaged presumably found its</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to Baltimore by the Caribbean's</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man from the hills went back to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">yam-patch and his dusky bride with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed dray, a penitent mule in mended</seg><seg type="columnLine">harness, the price of nine good bunches</seg><seg type="columnLine">mostly in his head, the rest being in Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chung's till, five "rejects" and the remains</seg><seg type="columnLine">of six mutilated banana stems. But then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had learned much.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hambridge observed all this without</seg><seg type="columnLine">once rising from his bench or removing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe from his mouth. Occasionally he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrote an order and had it passed to Mitch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chell. It usually was a command to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">some prospective banana-seller a la-a-arge</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink of rum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How goes the battle, General?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warden, coming to the busha's side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good enough," said Hambridge, rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloomily. "We hold our own. He's ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us on his contracted fruit, of course, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's turned a lousy trick or two.

Warden thought the over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seer did not look quite himself--a touch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fever perhaps. He advised a personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">application of the bribe-bottle as a stimu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lant to zest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't as a rule," said the bus ha</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully, "but I may before I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">through."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The afternoon lengthened and swift dusk</seg><seg type="columnLine">came. Into Rio Hacha trundled more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">donkeys, drays and natives burdened with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bananas. Many lights appeared on land</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sea and the tropic heavens lit their</seg><seg type="columnLine">million candles. The fireflies danced among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coconut palms and the low logwood</seg><seg type="columnLine">greenery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the semi-darkness the broad negro</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices, hilarious with rum or furious with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage, and the constant squealing and bray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of mules and donkeys contrasted oddly</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the mirroring sea from which the day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze had fled. Against the dense blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the evening sky the palms rose as sten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciled things in mid-air. The kling-kling</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds, returning in pairs to the palm-crests,</seg><seg type="columnLine">again beat out their anvil chorus, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the unanimous gusts of dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Already the rival steamers had appeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Caribbean's Amato first because it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained time through failure to get its quota</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the other ports along the coast. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amalgamated's Haciendado was now in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagoon, too. Her gun-ports were wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">open and the trust's handlers were passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in thousands of bunches of bananas. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wharf at the western end of the bay</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pereira's loaders could be heard number-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the bunches for the checker in a sing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">song with doggerel rhymings:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          Bana-a-ana--four'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         Come gimme one mo-ore--O!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          Bana-a-ana--fi-ive!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          Ho, boy, look ali-ive--O!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Amato had not begun to load. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first whaleboat had just left the Caribbean's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wharf and it would be some time before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hambridge could keep the passers as busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the stevedores desired to be. Things</seg><seg type="columnLine">were going badly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Earlier in the afternoon he had received</seg><seg type="columnLine">another dispatch from Warden Sr. at Port</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maria.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Amalgamated cleaning up everything all along.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amato not half laden!

And go she</seg><seg type="columnLine">must with her perishable cargo ripening in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her holds. But even if he captured every</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunch that came into Rio Hacha, even if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stole fruit regularly contracted to Perei-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ra, even if he assassinated the fat, lavender-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soaked sponge and lifted his deliveries from</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Gfeat God Ananzi</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">55</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the piled wharf, still he could not hope to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fill the Amato.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he told the anxious supercargo who</seg><seg type="columnLine">came ashore from the Amato the minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">she dropped her hook. But he went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work to do his best, although somehow that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious prescience followed him like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow. His pupil and guest, Warden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the fever of the game and went so</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as to leap himself to the driver's seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a newly arrived dray, shoulder the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prietor off and drive the load of bananas</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the Caribbean's shed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There!" he cried, dismounting, flushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with battle. "I like this game, buskat"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You-fool!" said Hambridge thickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You can't do that.

He would hate</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell the governor of this, but--he ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to. Hambridge was the company's best</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Ye gods!

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the curious grin on his face, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inane smirk of a man half-paralyzed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on!" said Warden, thinking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapse might be merely temporary--a touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fever and consequent light-headedness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let's lean up against it.

"He wins.</seg><seg type="columnLine">-tax on b'nanas anyway!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wins!" shouted Warden, his Yankee</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatred of defeat cropping out. "Not by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">darn sight! And if you're that sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">weak-spined rabbit-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardly knowing what he expected to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplish right away, he grabbed a bunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bananas from the hands of one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">negroes and-- just as quickly dropped it</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. He sprang back aghast. The ne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gro also leaped away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the bunch had dropped a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">spider, even larger than that which had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mayed him in the shack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Spidah!" yelled the negro.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Mitch-Chell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Warden, ashamed of the fact that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunch he had dropped had burst into three</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces, sprang with both feet upon the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sect, intent upon vengeance. He did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">miss. That spider emerged from the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pact a flat mess of pulp and quivering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hairy legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now you've done it!" said the Anglo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jamaican overseer. "That settles it. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you--" He hiccouped--"might's well</seg><seg type="columnLine">a killed Nancy this morning. Nancy heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">ya, an'way.

Mitch-Chell protested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut up--you!" shouted Hambridge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glaring at his henchman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But, busha-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will you close your black mouth!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared the busha. "Get me a drink!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!" groaned Warden, the pupil,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he turned toward the shack in despair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He would have to talk to the governor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before he entered the shack he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back at the wharf-shed. The chief runner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mitch-Chell, appeared to be arguing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the busha. Hambridge had gripped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">negrp by the shoulders--possibly for sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port or in drunken affection--and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing in his face. Warden went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room in the shack where he had slept every</seg><seg type="columnLine">night for nearly a week--for no purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">except to be alone with his thoughts. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first thing his eyes sought and found was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ananzi spider of the morning, still im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pending over his cot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had not moved. It was like a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">insect fastened by some invisible web.</seg><seg type="columnLine">56</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventu?&amp; t</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Only the light of the hurricane lamp caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">two little gleaming points in its head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shuddered slightly. He desired to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill it, attributing to the strange creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow the ill-luck of the day; desiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">more to slay it because Hambridge seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to believe in its power, that he himself was</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-inclined. . .Bah!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He picked up one of his still sodden</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathing-shoes and balanced it for an accu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate shot. But as he swung his arm a voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick with inebriation, said behind him:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don' do it! Musn' do it, ol' fella!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Warden gave the busha one contemptu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous look and hurled the shoe with all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">force. The spider vanished. The Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can turned furiously upon the overseer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was chuckling inanely. Hambridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed waveringly to the opposite wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Misshed!" said he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was the spider! How it had got</seg><seg type="columnLine">over there, whether it had leaped or--some</seg><seg type="columnLine">magic. It seemed impossible; yet there it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The overseer reeled toward the wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand. He poured a half tumbler of liquid</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a black bottle which had stood there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drained it off. Then he fairly col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapsed on his cot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Warden, disgusted, dismayed beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression, went out into the night. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury raged in him. He would not let his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dad lose because his dad's trusted best man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fallen down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took charge; but he might as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">have followed the busha's example, at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the matter of going to bed. The hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened dully to his orders, or quite ignored</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. They, too, had slacked up. They,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, had been drinking. They worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, clumsily. Bunches of bananas were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped and shattered. They pitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">other bunches into the whaleboat, bruising</seg><seg type="columnLine">them against marketable possibility. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed dray after dray to run the gantlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">unchallenged. The victorious Pereira on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other horn chuckled as he heard of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Soused--on Banana Day!" he said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chief runner. "Never knew him take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink before, even. Well, it's an ill wind--</seg><seg type="columnLine">my tally says twenty-two thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunches. How about yours, Amos?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a last resort Warden appealed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mitch-Chell, the faithful. Upon him, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spell of evil had descended. He, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed more than half drunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wehfado, buccra?" ("What else can we</seg><seg type="columnLine">do, white man?") he said.

It had been a disastrous week</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the independents, especially at Rio</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hacha.

On the other cot lay the busha,</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently dead to the world. By his side</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a broken chair and on it the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle and a glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What was the man drinking, anyway?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The dregs in the glass were not red or brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">or amber, but transparent and colorless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was it possible he had sunk secretly to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last resort of the tropic tippler--gin?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sadly anxious to know the worst, Warden</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiptoed to the side of the man he had ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mired until that night. He smelled of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid in the glass. It had no odor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neither had the remainder of it in the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle. He poured a few drops on the palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his left hand and touched it with the tip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was plain water! Yet ....</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">§|p||[ IN THE morning there was little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IIIjkI to be said. The busha, naturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, slept late. Warden took</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dip in the Rio Hacha alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pereira came around, as usual after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Banana Day, to talk it over, offer to shake</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and call it a deal for another week.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On this occasion he expressed the sympathy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of good fellowship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We all do it, even the best of us, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">times," said he. "Suppose you have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair of the dog, Hambridge?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, massa," said Hambridge gravely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I never touch the stuff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pereira chuckled and helped himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bottle he had brought along for</seg><seg type="columnLine">diplomatic use.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Great God Ananzi</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Warden came back from the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found them seated together, quite friend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, talking over the setting of a turtle</seg><seg type="columnLine">net.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Warden did not like it.

Well, I'll give him a fair hearing."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hambridge, upon a summons to Port</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maria next day, rode there huddled in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle like a bag of loose bricks.

Possibly he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ass, a superstitious fool, but ever since</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time he lost on the favorite in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Overseers' Sweepstakes he had been more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more inclined to listen to that inward</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. No, not voice. That. . .What was</seg><seg type="columnLine">it the Americans called it?

Yet I</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have ventured a suggestion concerning</seg><seg type="columnLine">my condition, and the lack of any need of</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the startlingly intensive "training" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned for me. But he was decided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fights he had known in plenty, but never</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a fight as this. Usually he had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">principal, a more than willing combatant;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maze of Memory</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">61</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but now he was an organizer, a director, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trainer, a second, a man of functions. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was no common fight--no mere differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of opinion followed by a blow and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle among cuspidors and men's feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a barroom floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No, this was to be a well-conducted con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">test, with--had he not told me--a watch for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the keeper of time, a referee, certain wagers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a purse for the winner. And was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">training the invariable preliminary to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">such deliberate entertainments? Was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, a small matter like shortness of time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be allowed to upset a well-established</seg><seg type="columnLine">custom? Would we let the keeper of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">public house, the referee and all the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrons of sport think us ignorant?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brennan was very serious. And there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the other side of it. Did he not want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do the best for me? And how could I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight my best if I were not trained? I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not sure myself, and my vague notions</seg><seg type="columnLine">respecting time were dissipated by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnestness. Only, there did seem to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">something wrong about training for a fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few hours away. But who was I to argue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hurt his feelings? Besides, if it hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">been for him there wouldn't have been any</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight. And no fight meant no purse of three</seg><seg type="columnLine">or four shillings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three or four shillings would buy a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">second-hand books. And Brennan might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be right, after all. Of course I was big and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong, and had taught myself to read al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most all the words in my precious books,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but--I was only a bit over fifteen, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brennan was a man. He must know best.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Train I would. And we had the ship to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves, for the officers and crew were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt that Brennan would have liked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have an audience, but there was only the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">night-watchman, puffing a contemplative</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe over the galley door, and watching our</seg><seg type="columnLine">performance with a face expressive of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">utmost approval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shadows gathered as I trained--</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the deck as fast as I could run, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down the rigging almost as rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">--until the few lanterns that flickered about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dock told that the night of adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">was upon us. The day-time voice of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city had hushed to a soothing undertone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smoke of the many chimneys was drift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out to sea in fantastic shapes which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never again assume, and I, utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhausted, was fed with mastodonic zeal,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and played with advice that I regarded as</seg><seg type="columnLine">cunning beyond price.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, hardly able to move, I was assisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my bunk, where I at once fell asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shades of an ultra-perfect digestion, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">an imagination as little likely to trouble as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faitliful dog to bite! An hour later I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakened, and I awoke reluctantly--so</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired and sleepy that even the lure of dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">figuring another human had no attraction</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me. And with Brennan in the smelly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly lit forecastle was the night-watchman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrilling unheeded reminiscences in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracked treble of age about the gory battles</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which he himself had had a hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An examination into my physical condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion followed, the result of which afforded</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire satisfaction to both my trainer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ancient admirer. Often, in the light of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knowledge of further years, did I muse</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the method of that examination, find-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a fascination in its uniqueness--as if,</seg><seg type="columnLine">testing the fitness of a horse about to run a</seg><seg type="columnLine">race, the color of its tail was the crucial</seg><seg type="columnLine">consideration. Yet I was genuinely glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Brennan found no fault in me, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night-watchman's toothless comments</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose to the shrill exclamation that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't mind betting a shilling on me</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, that he wouldn't.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So what wonder if I took on new dignity</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I dressed to go ashore--a dignity that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chill drizzle, pattering in a melancholy way</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the water of the dock, and dripping dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mally off everything else, in no wise ruffled</seg><seg type="columnLine">or upset. The gaunt masts and rigging of</seg><seg type="columnLine">many ships looked an impartial understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out of their own stressful fives, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchman waved his smoky lantern, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">set out upon my crusade with my squire</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying a pair of swimming trunks--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">armor in which I was to fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, indeed, I felt something of knight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood in my attitude toward the affair, spite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the victor's wreath being a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">three or four shillings: for was I not content</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight without question, out of sheer loy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alty to my rather erratic friend, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown his faith in me by what to him was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large wager? Could I imagine keener joy</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that coming from his pat on the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gratitude when he pocketed the money I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had won for him?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the prospect of the fight itself was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean delight, and every step of our muddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress brought its thrill of anticipation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Little fun had life offered me--no school, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">62</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">playmates, never a "show" or a "party"--</seg><seg type="columnLine">what wonder, then, that I became as happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and excited at the thought of what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">before me as a luckier child would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the way to a circus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Brennan did not guess my state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. Perhaps I seemed thoughtful, for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw him glancing at me furtively whenever</seg><seg type="columnLine">we passed under a street lamp, and he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to regale me with funny stories, told with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous haste that betrayed his fear of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental condition--something which even</seg><seg type="columnLine">his system of training could not take care</seg><seg type="columnLine">of--the while he pushed his way through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowds with an eye to my protection</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the jostling drunkenness of both sexes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His solicitude pleased and flattered me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indeed, I strutted, swelling slightly at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual importance--for I had no memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ever having been of greater consequence</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a fathom of rope or a pot of paint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A FEW yards past the grotesquely</seg><seg type="columnLine">abominable "Museum of Anat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">omy," we turned down a dingy side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">street that had no lamps of its own, and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the lights of the main thoroughfare</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly penetrated. It was a very narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, uneven cobblestones under foot, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sidewalk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two gin-sodden women veritably flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves at us, hiccuping, "Hello,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dearie," like two cuckoo clocks.

So he knocked again, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">loudly. And then we heard footsteps, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drawing of bolts, and the door opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">widely enough for a head to protrude and</seg><seg type="columnLine">break the uncanny secrecy of the perform-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance by asking what we wanted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's us," whispered Brennan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A gust of wind blew a spluttering of rain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the head swore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And who in-is 'us'?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me and the boy for the fight," explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">my companion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh," said the head, withdrawing itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to open the door. "Why didn't you say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that at first?

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as dark as a tomb, and smelt horribly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shivered for many reasons, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheered but little when the saloon-keeper lit</seg><seg type="columnLine">a piece of candle which he produced from</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere about his person after a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunts--each grunt indicating a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">place of search.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked at him apprehensively in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little light.

The bird shows it when the cat</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaches, certain animals bow before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake because of it, and the old-time sailor</seg><seg type="columnLine">always manifested it when in the presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crimp or saloon-keeper, both of whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">made their living by robbing him. Bren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nan answered servilely, and I felt shocked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You say he ain't sixteen?" the saloon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper grunted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maze of Memory</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">63</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just a bit over fifteen," replied Brennan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a deprecating giggle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "-," exclaimed the other, "he's ugly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for twenty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brennan laughed loudly, and seemed de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted that the other appreciated his</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And where's your boy?" he asked, show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing pride in the saloon-keeper's toleration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tentative familiarity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I never lets him out till the fight is</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to start.

He laughed until the fat man</seg><seg type="columnLine">hushed him with a reminder about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police, who were very active at suppressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">these illegal fights--hence the cellar. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">they turned and walked down the passage</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, and I trailed along behind, physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally and spiritually sick, keeping back my</seg><seg type="columnLine">tears with a great effort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The saloon-keeper opened another door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the place of battle flared before us, lit</seg><seg type="columnLine">with lanterns strung from the floor above</seg><seg type="columnLine">and along the walls. A small--far-too-</seg><seg type="columnLine">small--ring, without any padding, occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pied the center of the cellar, and crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">around it upon a heterogeneous collection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">seats were about two dozen men, who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">varying the monotony of smoking by spit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting generously upon that part of the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">where presently I would have to stand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were greeted by what the parlia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentary reports call "cheers and laughter,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I shrank under the unkindly curiosity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the spectators, whose attention was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessarily directed to my unhappy self by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the owner of the place--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'Ere's the fighter!" he announced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he said something to Brennan which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not hear, and my "second" beckoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to follow him to a comer of the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I shiveringly undressed and put on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swimming-trunks, after wringing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain out of them as well as I could. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course I had no rubber shoes, only my</seg><seg type="columnLine">clumsy every-day affairs, but Brennan</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not appear to notice this need, or,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, he did not know that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet I tried to smile at him, finding no</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate in me, and--oh, well, we all revolve</seg><seg type="columnLine">within our limitations, the years have mel-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed the memories, and the seed of early</seg><seg type="columnLine">association has grown into a friendship that</seg><seg type="columnLine">finds nothing to forgive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a burst of real cheering announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entrance of my antagonist, and I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">over at him, startled and much afraid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brennan had said that he was ugly, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">description was not unkind. The saloon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper had said that I was ugly enough for</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty. I do not flatter myself, but using</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same method of calculation the boy I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to fight must have been nearly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand; and he was at least twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds heavier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Brennan led me back to the ring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving my one poor suit as a careless offer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to any thief that unpleasant gathering</seg><seg type="columnLine">might contain, and I found myself sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on an up-ended box, waiting for the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world and hoping it would'come quickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The main events of my unhappy little life</seg><seg type="columnLine">came before me, and I had not felt so miser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able since somebody stole the barrel in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which for three weeks I had once made my</seg><seg type="columnLine">home. For Brennan was the one friend I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had known, the only human being from</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom I could remember receiving any sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of affection, any sort of kindness; and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had denied me for the laughter of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon-keeper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT THE opposite comer sat my</seg><seg type="columnLine">rugged opponent, attended by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds--two young fellows like</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, posturing with what they obviously</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarded as the correct amount of tough-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. The spectators were pridefully ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertising their friendship for the boy I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight with vociferous questions concern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his health, and to these questions he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the properly condescending replies;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but after some minutes of this they became</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent, and I found myself the object of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">wordless appraisement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tried to look back at them all, not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show my courage, but with the vague, vain</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope of finding just one spark of pity, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps might lead them to "let me off"--</seg><seg type="columnLine">my body shaking with the mixed emotions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a schoolboy about to be publicly</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrashed, and a felon waiting to be hanged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But there was no pity, only regret that I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not appear to be enough of a fighter to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the affair interesting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Brennan patted me timidly on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, and I felt that he was sorry for what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had done; so I warmed to him, like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">64</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry dog grateful to the one foot in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd that does not kick him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a slight disturbance at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of the crowd where some steps led to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bar above, and the saloon-keeper ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared, half-supporting a tall, thin man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge mustache, who was evidently very</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk, but whose dress, and an indefinable</seg><seg type="columnLine">something, proclaimed the "gentleman"--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">proclamation which the extreme deference</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the owner of the house corroborated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With some difficulty this person was as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted to a seat at the ringside, where he im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately fell asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Captain Blake, the referee," announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saloon-keeper, pulling out his watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the intimation that he would keep time</seg><seg type="columnLine">and look after the refereeing until the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain "felt better"; an arrangement to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one offered any objection--for after all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "fight" was merely a show, to amuse the</seg><seg type="columnLine">customers of the place into buying more</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinks from the two frowsy potmen who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were kept busy navigating through the fog</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tobacco smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blake had probably offered to referee in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment of drunken»whimsy, and the saloon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper, anxious to oblige a good customer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had accepted the offer, regarding the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointment as a distinctly humorous for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mality and using it as an added lure for Bren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nan's bet of ten shillings. For it is unlikely</seg><seg type="columnLine">that any of the spectators saw any necessity</seg><seg type="columnLine">for having a referee, and some of them saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">no need for a timekeeper--prefering to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">me beaten to a pulp without the minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">rests between punishments; but the major-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity were of a more epicurean leaning, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">esthetic tastes demanding a more lingering</seg><seg type="columnLine">brutality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only Brennan found a glimmering of</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt regarding the ethical status of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">dual official, and, doubtless feeling that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cordial reception at the cellar door entitled</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to intimacy, he approached the saloon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper smiling deprecatingly and timidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered his objection, adding, as his rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son for speaking, a laughing but most un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diplomatic reference to the ten shillings--</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, by the way, he had not only bet with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saloon-keeper, but, also, with child-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">faith, had "put up" with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho," shouted the master of the cere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monies loudly, "wot is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the dead silence that naturally followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brennan murmured something about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">double job being too much for one man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Speak up," bellowed the saloon-keeper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making great pretense of listening with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand cupped over an ear. "Speak up, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">carnt 'ear yer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Brennan could not speak, up or</seg><seg type="columnLine">otherwise. Under the leering gaze of every</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the place, except the sleeping Blake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he flushed and shuffled his feet uneasily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, with a pitiful effort to appear uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerned, he returned to his place behind me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saloon-keeper winking elaborately to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd and raising an appreciative laugh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For Brennan, so far as the owner of the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">was concerned, had long ceased to exist, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wager had changed hands when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money had changed pockets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was always thus with Brennan's type</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore. In a ship's forecastle, not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">would their positions have been reversed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the fat man would have been washing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brennan's place after meals--out of sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, that is. Now my friend was as help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less as a shanghaied sailor in the power of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crimp, and he tried to hide his ignominy</seg><seg type="columnLine">by whispering plaintively to me:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The referee, me boy, is a real gentleman</seg><seg type="columnLine">--he'll see ye get fair play. Once he was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer in the army--just a bit of a habit he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had of cheating at cards was what got him</seg><seg type="columnLine">put out. So-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But his doubtful testimonial was inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted by the saloon-keeper, who called</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Time," and waved his hand expressively.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I saw my opponent dancing toward me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fighting attitude--I forgot to mention</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was a "bare fist" fight--and all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew of right and wrong bade me get up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and meet him. But I was unable to move.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sat helpless, not so much from fear--al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though fear was but half-suppressed--as</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a strange pity that suddenly grew into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a most extraordinary fondness for every one</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that cellar, the result of the emotional</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm I had been through. I craved affec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, not contest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And my opponent was coming nearer--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had almost reached the center of the ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but still I could not move. My thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were racing past my ego, like hurricane-torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds driving across the face of the moon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The dreams of my very earliest years</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled up from the dark horizon of forget-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulness, and I wondered again why I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been put into a world for which I had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire. I forgot, became oblivious to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">surroundings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fact of another human's intention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maze of Memory</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">65</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"beat me up" became as relatively unim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant as it was absolutely so. The hoarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring of the spectators was the wind in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rigging, and it was soothing. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very sleepy, and I would go to sleep. Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would sleep, and perhaps I would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">obliged to wake up any more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was a discordant note in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind, and because of that discord I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not sleep. I tried to ignore it, but it per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted with devilish insistency. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I made out that it was Brennan's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">howling, and patting my back as he howled:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up at him, Barney, and scatter every</seg><seg type="columnLine">feature of his face."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that I jumped to my feet, and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">for my opponent, who had just reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the small ring. I had no wish to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight, and I was still a bit dazed, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the red-headed boy with the for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lorn friendliness of a stray puppy. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed at me, dropping his hands in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sultingly; whereupon the saloon-keeper, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still in the ring, also laughed, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jovial spectators added their hilarity to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">general mirth. Now, even a dog resents</seg><seg type="columnLine">being laughed at.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A cold anger stiffened my spine, cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">my tired brain and added strength to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ijody; an ancient ancestor-lent me his stone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age ferocity, the cruelty of those who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">long been dust stirred my Ijlood, and a cu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riously pleasant determination to smash the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly face of my antagonist became the sole</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason of existence. He leaned toward me</seg><seg type="columnLine">tauntingly, his hands by his sides, and as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">vile breath puffed into my face I jabbed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">viciously on the nose--the sudden spurt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood cheering me more than anything I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever seen. He hit back, and his blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed somewhere, but I felt no pain. So,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we stood, toe to toe, slugging at each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">U I I MUST imagine that the specta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prg? tors were surprised, and that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon-keeper nearly dropped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch in astonishment, for I was too busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to notice them; but the pained grunts of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">opponent were not imaginary, nor was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">change that underwent his expression--not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only that of blood and bruises, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">change from the grinning leer of confidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the dawning fear of possible defeat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stepped back, and I followed; then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately drove at me until he bore me by</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer weight to my corner, getting home a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific blow on my left eye which almost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">blinded me; then for some time we struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a clinch, the referee making no attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to separate us, because I was at a disad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage owing to my being th'e lighter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, in spite of Brennan's training, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the better condition by far. Even with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his extra weight, my opponent tired of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrestling before I did, and at last he</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosened his hold on me and stepped back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping his guard as he did so. Seeing my</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity, I drove my fist into that part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his body where ribs cease to be ribs--</seg><seg type="columnLine">where flesh is weak, and had my full</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength been behind it, that blow would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have ended the fight, but, as I hit him, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist hit my biceps, and the power of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">punch was lessened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nevertheless, it looked as if he would col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapse. His knees sagged inward, his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped forward, and so sure was I that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">was over that I stepped back without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">finishing blow I could have so easily given.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he pluckily straightened, and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to retreat. Too late, I followed excitedly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitting at him with far more energy than</seg><seg type="columnLine">skill, making most remarkable swings at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, more often than not missing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly aim by a foot, and forgetting all about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vulnerable portion of his anatomy I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">recently disturbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Why hadn't I finished him when I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chance? Why had I held back--wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">I there to beat him up? Was I going to let</seg><seg type="columnLine">him win? And so on--I prodded myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a sort of desperation, forgetting what</seg><seg type="columnLine">little boxing I knew, but utterly changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the scared child who had come into</seg><seg type="columnLine">that cellar. Twice I bumped into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon-keeper, who had cast aside the dig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nities of timekeeper and referee, and who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was exhorting his boy with the zeal of both</seg><seg type="columnLine">backer and second--the boy responding by</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging at me as wildly as-I swung at him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and making about as many hits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a frantic scene, with the spectators</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their feet, yelling advice and criticism,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping pipes and upsetting beer mugs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands waving, fists pounding palms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sometimes I got a glimpse of their faces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gibbering like strangely pale baboons at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bars of a cage, with the uncertain fog of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke billowing fantastically. Occasion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally I slipped, and occasionally the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy slipped, but a curious chivalry grew be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween us, so that neither hit when the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on his knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I could see that the saloon-keeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">66</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could hardly keep from hitting at me him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, and knew that at the first chance he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do something foul to defeat me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And here I must give credit to my antag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onist; for once when his boss told him, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded him, to hit me when I was down, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found something in his soul which told that</seg><seg type="columnLine">obese brute to "go to-1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The noise increased, and wilder became</seg><seg type="columnLine">our boxing. It seemed ages since I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn a satisfactory breath, and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">throbbing heart was reaching up into my</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat. The lights swayed uncertainly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my opponent's ghastly, bloody face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as difficult to hit as that of the chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil in a nightmare. The arcs described</seg><seg type="columnLine">by our swinging fists became smaller, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fists themselves took on the weight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannon-balls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Amid my physical distress I found myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering if my face was as badly mauled</seg><seg type="columnLine">as that of the red-headed boy. Then, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">both of the same mind, we fell into a clinch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbing, not breathing, upon each other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder; and through the tumult of voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">came that of the saloon-keeper--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of three minutes, we must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been fighting for ten; and whether he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped us because we could fight no longer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or because he was afraid the noise would</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring the police, is something I have never</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided. With uncertain steps, I stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered in the general direction of Brennan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but instead of taking the box he hastily</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed forward for me to sit upon I lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon that indescribably dirty stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, finding it as delicious a haven as ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered by a feather bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And my unexpected success had won me</seg><seg type="columnLine">some adherents. Half-conscious, I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a pillow of empty sacks was being put</seg><seg type="columnLine">under my buzzing head, that rough hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">were lifting my brusied body tenderly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laying another sack between it and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, and that Brennan was fanning me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">amateurish vigor and the tails of my shirt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I also knew that no power either in</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaven or in earth could get me in shape to</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue the fight at the end of the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribed interval of one minute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I need not have concerned myself, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon-keeper had no intention of allowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his duty as timekeeper to interfere with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">workings of his "natural affection" for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">protege. He was swearing horribly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfortunate boy because I was as yet un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">licked, while the two seconds rubbed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fanned him, but several minutes passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">without his showing any interest in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch, and I knew that the red-headed one</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be allowed to fully recover before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the spectators were impatient. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to see somebody beaten properly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the delay annoyed them. It was noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to them if the saloon-keeper's boy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">licked. There were other saloon-keepers</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fighting boys, who sold as good beer</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the same price; and as my strength and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind came back to me, until I felt almost as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as I had done before the fight, I under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood what I had hitherto been ignorant of.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Competition was keen between the differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent public houses of the district, and, price-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting having gone the limit, some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">attraction was required to get the business.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hence these fighting boys. Every saloon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper had one, and the red-headed boy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">proven the best of them all. Therefore, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a valuable asset, and his boss did a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bigger business than his rivals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was all very simple-- had I looked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have had a chance, we would have been told</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the cellar door that the fight was off; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now that I was more than holding my own,</seg><seg type="columnLine">every dirty trick would be tried to defeat</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. The red-headed boy lacked my con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition, and the spectators were booing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistling, like the audience in the gallery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a theater, for the show to continue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Time--call time," yelled one large-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunged individual at the ring side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'Taint quite time yet," replied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon-keeper placatingly, his pig-like eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking in my direction with an illuminating</seg><seg type="columnLine">malevolence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Call time," the other yelled back at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Call-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, suddenly the bibulous but some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times benevolent god of the chances</seg><seg type="columnLine">prompted him, and he leaned over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook Captain Blake's shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'Ere, you're the referee, ain't yer? Make</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em fight!" and he laughed heartily, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd laughing with him, and the saloon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper readily grasping the opportunity for</seg><seg type="columnLine">further delay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lor', BUI, you're the funny one," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheezed.

"And, besides, I'm going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">referee inside, American fashion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wiped his hands fastidiously, and fas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cinated me by tucking his handkerchief up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sleeve, and, the potman having spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sawdust--the spectators watching with</seg><seg type="columnLine">admiring silence--he stepped into the ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Briggs," he asked, "what's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">delay?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'T'aint quite time yet, sir," answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saloon-keeper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, it is," yelled the crowd.

"So, you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir," Briggs' voice was full of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right--get out of the ring."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get out of the ring."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, sir," obeying slowly.

It was obvious that I was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">better condition, and that if he kept at it</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this rate he would tire out, and be at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercy. That was my job, then--to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">him waste his strength with these wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">swings, keep out of danger and wait for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity. It was very simple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, we whaled away at each other, Blake</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching us carefully and the spectators</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelling their appreciation. But this did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">last long. As I had expected, my opponent</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to back away from me, showing every</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of weariness, while I was fairly com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable. I followed him, still swinging and</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasionally getting home lightly. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he backed against the ropes, his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">lolling tiredly. I had him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wavered, his hands dropped, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadied myself for the final blow. Next</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment came the realization that I was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second or two too late; for the other boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened up, and putting all his remain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing strength into the blow, beat me to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">punch--getting home on the point of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">chin--and I landed in a quivering heap on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trampled sawdust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I was not out, and I felt no pain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only I was so angry at myself for falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">into so simple a trap that I could have cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over me Captain Blake was counting, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his was the only voice in the cellar, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of Brennan, who was putting up some</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful prayer to the numerous queer</seg><seg type="columnLine">deities of his acquaintance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I was puzzled. Why was the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain counting me out? Couldn't he see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could get up as soon as I wanted to? Did</seg><seg type="columnLine">he think I was hurt? Why, I was all right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would just he there for a little while, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Five--six."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was absurd. And everybody watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me, and so quiet, too. Of course, I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a man was beaten when ten seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">were counted over him, but that meant a</seg><seg type="columnLine">68</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt man--I was not hurt--I could get up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">if I wanted to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Seven."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There he went again. One thing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, the seconds seemed to be long ones, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">those when one is half-asleep. But it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all rot. Surely the captain knew that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-headed boy could'nt hit hard enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hurt me?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Barney, Barney--get up, get up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oh, well, I thought drowsily, suppose I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must.

But, must get up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I yawned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I don't remember getting to my feet. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the fist of my opponent swing past my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head without touching, and then the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petus of his blow carried him into me, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">clung desperately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Break--break," commanded Blake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still I hung on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain tried to pry us apart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's time," I shouted. "More than</seg><seg type="columnLine">three minutes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blake pulled out his watch, and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">sternly at the saloon-keeper, who wilted</seg><seg type="columnLine">under that look, and called "time." I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled into Brennan's arms, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">eased down upon the kindly sacks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So," Blake was saying, "you let the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time pass. Want your boy to win, eh?</seg><seg type="columnLine">After this, I'll keep time myself. A little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more nerve, Briggs, and you would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded--I hadn't looked at my watch for</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours until just now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I really wasn't much hurt, although I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heartily wished for more than one minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest; and when the captain, totally ignoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saloon-keeper, called "time," I had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble stopping the rushes of the red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed boy, and presently I felt that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">far more tired than I was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now I was not swinging--contenting</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself with blocking, and waiting for a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain opening, and at last it came; the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy dropped his guard for a moment, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit him again where ribs end, and he sank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">groaning, to the floor, apparently all in. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened so suddenly that it looked like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluke, and perhaps it was, but I was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">worried by that. I was too pleased to hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain counting over somebody else to</seg><seg type="columnLine">care how that somebody came to be counted</seg><seg type="columnLine">over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT that boy was plucky, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he struggled to his feet at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">count of nine, I felt sorry for him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only a few minutes before he thought he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had won, and my youthful health had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheated him. Besides, his very existence</seg><seg type="columnLine">depended upon his winning, while to me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight was but an incident, an experience to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember and talk about. He staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathetically as he got up, and the specta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors held their breath, waiting for the finish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I didn't want to do it. I saw no reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">why I should hit the poor devil again. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a stranger to me, and, somehow, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had grown to like him. Why take away his</seg><seg type="columnLine">living, then? And then I remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brennan's ten shillings, and the purse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">three or four bob, of which I had seen no</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since I had entered that cellar, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">changes of years had passed over me. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to understand that certain things</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be done, however much we may dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like doing them, and however much we</seg><seg type="columnLine">may wonder why the Absolute should allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions which make it necessary we</seg><seg type="columnLine">should do them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, it was necessary that I should re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duce that red-headed boy to a condition</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he could fight no more. I put up my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few feet away my opponent stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying on sagging legs. I made a step</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him, and then the saloon-keeper lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">control of himself and deliberately pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his foot into the ring and tripped me</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the rottenest trick I had ever seen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was mad clear through. I forgot the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-headed boy, turned 'round, hearing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">babble of voices, and hit the saloon-keeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the middle of his fat face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was the most comforting blow I ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck. But it had the most extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">results. One of those causeless panics,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which occur in herds of humans and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattle, was the consequence; and it all hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened so rapidly that to tell about it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The red-headed boy seems to have started</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Whether he thought that my striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his boss was a sort of sacrilege, or whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was his notion of the end of the earth, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether he knew that Mr. Briggs' temper</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some hours would be a thing best</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoided, and, consequently, lost his head in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his haste to escape, I know not. Let it be</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maze of Memory</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">simply told that he dived under the ropes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with more activity than I thought he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, shouting at the top of his voice--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ' 'Police--police--help--murder.

As it opens, Markenson is</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated in a deck chair on the awning-shaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarterdeck of the auxiliary schooner Jane</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nichols at anchor in Tamana harbor, idly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazing forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently Doctor Craig Jarvis, an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citable little man, came up the cabin hatch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and threw himself wearily into the loam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mock stretched from the mizzenmast to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skylight. Both men were as nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">naked as civilized men dare to be and still</seg><seg type="columnLine">retain a measure of their modesty; but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat waves that danced and quivered along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unshaded portions of the deck seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make a mockery of any attempts to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable.

For two solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours the two men sat on in silence and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun went down behind the rim of the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Kanaka crew knocked off with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chain, then Markenson removed his bulky</seg><seg type="columnLine">frame from the chair in which he sat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved toward the low rail.

But no matter how far distant his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hallucinations led him he always returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the person whom he called "Edith, dar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling." He muttered over and over, seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly to the girl, that it was a "blasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">he!" Jarvis, who had paused beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunk where the sick man lay tossing, heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shook his head sadly. He picked up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, silver-framed photo of a girl he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Dyer's pillow and gazed at it long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">intently, his gaze at intervals wandering</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Dyer's flushed face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he replaced the photo on the pil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low and swore softly to himself. Jarvis</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never been in love, but he knew some</seg><seg type="columnLine">things not in medical books. It is better</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give a man latitude in which to express</seg><seg type="columnLine">his delirium audibly than to give him medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cine to make him sleep and choke him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">phantasmagoria, so Jarvis betook himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his own bunk across the passageway and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left his patient to fight it out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some time in the very early morning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next day, before the veil-like mist had</seg><seg type="columnLine">blown out to sea, Markenson was awakened</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a fitful sleep at the bungalow by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumultuous knocking on the veranda.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the row?" he yelled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is Johnny here, Tiny?" came a voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the agent instantly recognized as</seg><seg type="columnLine">belonging to his doctor friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An anxious note in the voice caused him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hop hastily from his bunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What about Johnny?" he inquired, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearing on the veranda where stood Jarvis</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad in very little of nothing except his</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses with their retaining ribbon stream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in a festoon about their wearer's neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Markenson noted that his caller was</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-faced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, what about Johnny?" he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded a second time when the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be lost in peering into the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness where the Jane Nichols' riding light</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimmered like a star on the water. •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's gone!" the doctor burst out finally.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What?"

Big Rock got its name from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that it was indeed no less than a mam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moth rock, circular in shape, about two</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles in diameter, and circumscribed on all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides by sheer cliffs from one to two hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet high.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No luck," confessed Jarvis weakly when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parties met.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I am positive nothing escaped us</seg><seg type="columnLine">but our luck was no better," said Marken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, sitting down in dejection.

Provi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence was represented in the person of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the natives who suddenly gave a shout</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pointed toward a tongue of rock jut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting out from the top of the cliff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The others looked and saw a naked man</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing on the tongue of rock, his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his hips, looking down at them with</seg><seg type="columnLine">great concern. They could see his features</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinctly. It was the missing Dyer. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw that he was discovered he emitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whoop and swung his arm in a wide arc,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the next moment a heavy stone came</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashing down into their midst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You fool!" yelled Markenson, dodging</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the stone caromed against a boulder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went bounding away, narrowly missing one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the natives in its flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop it!" supplemented the little doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">noisily, and scooped up a stone and threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with all his strength at the man above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It fell short by a good measure and called</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth a derisive, taunting yell from the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the cliff, who then disappeared beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the cliff and they saw him no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Markenson turned to the natives, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were standing nearby in a huddled, fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened group, and engaged one of them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation. He had not gone far in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioning when he saw that the man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowering under an abject fear; he trembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">visibly. Markenson shot a quick glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the other natives and saw tliat the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">was true of them; they appeared like dogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of a master's whip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man to whom he was talking stut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered and halted in his speech and nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligible came from his lips.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the cliff was as absolutely smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flat as a wall of glass. Though he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived on Tamana Island a matter of three</seg><seg type="columnLine">years Markenson knew practically nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Big Rock. From what he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to gather from the native it was inac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessible.

One end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer line he fastened to the "eye" on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shank of the grapnel, and one end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorter line he fastened to one of the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooks of the grapnel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He then turned his attention to a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">coconut palm that stood somewhat apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a clump of its fellows. This tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have been produced by a nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">anticipating the needs of the Trinty, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it lent itself very readily to the scheme the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big agent had in mind. It grew with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight inclination away from the cliff, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">base, which was about seventy-five feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant from.the base of the cliff, rooted</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the very edge of a steep incline. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bole was smooth and supple, terminating</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a scant clump of foliage about fifty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a satisfied nod Markenson ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the Kanakas to shinny up the tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the free end of the grapnel line and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fasten it at the top. When this had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">done and the man once more stood on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground the agent led the two lines with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grapnel dangling between down the incline</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly away from the -face of the cliff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Markenson paused and looked at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little doctor and grinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A catapult, eh?" said the doctor, return-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "History has a habit of repeating itself,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitted the agent proudly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The idea was to shoot the grapnel to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of the cliff with the spring of the palm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">All hands now "tailed" on and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">haul away, Frankie Blue passing several</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns of the hauling line about a convenient</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree and taking in the slack as the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauled it back to him. Foot by foot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch by inch the supple bole of the palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent away from the cliff until it formed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep bow and the line was as taut as a fidclle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">string.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When all was in readiness Markenson</seg><seg type="columnLine">slashed the shorter hauling line close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grapnel. The palm whipped up with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush of wind, the long line with the grapnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">at its end trailing after. Up and up went</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grapnel, sailing over the top of the palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and continuing its swift flight over the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cliff where it lodged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the grapnel disappeared a howl of</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror went up from the natives, and before</seg><seg type="columnLine">either of the white men knew what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">transpiring the Kanakas were streaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">away down the incline in the direction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle a short distance away. Frankie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blue alone hesitated and was lost; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatening glance he received from Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kenson, though not sufficient to quell the</seg><seg type="columnLine">uprisings of Frankie's barbarous nature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was yet sufficient to stay his itching legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the devil!" ejaculated the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor, who stood in wide-eyed wonder until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last of the bounding Kanakas had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared in the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Markenson hesitated between a laugh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">an oath, the former finally mastering him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're a bit frightened, Jarvis, that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all," said he laughingly. "The gentlemen</seg><seg type="columnLine">with whom I conversed a while ago in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed me that Buwani, God of Things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwells atop the cliff and we've desecrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">holy ground.

"A native can't forget his ancestral</seg><seg type="columnLine">gods in a day, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jarvis dismissed the thing with a shrug</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank the Lord, they've left us the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grub," he said fervently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BY THIS time the sun was hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blood-red disk in the west and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided 1o let matters rest until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning.

So</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frankie'Blue, all ashiver from what he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen and still expected to see, made a fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lee of a boulder and prepared a sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per of canned beef, ship's bread and coffee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The meal over the two whites sat puffing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at their pipes and talking, then sought their</seg><seg type="columnLine">couches of freshly cut leaves and slept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep of the just. Not so Frankie Blue?</seg><seg type="columnLine">superstition and fear had put him in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of mind where he could hardly bat</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes without conjuring up a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">devils to torment him. At times he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">an almost uncontrollable impulse to fly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a glance at the sleeping form of the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent nearby quelled the impulse. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty much like a man between the devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the deep sea, was the Kanaka boat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swain--if he remained the devils would</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably destroy him, and if he fled there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was much likelihood of losing his soft snap</seg><seg type="columnLine">as boatswain of the Jane Nichols.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So debating the matter with himself he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat with his knees drawn up under his chin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stared moodily into the fire. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just before daybreak when Markenson</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly opened his eyes and looked up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kanaka's terror-stricken face. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent's sudden wakening was caused by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frankie prodding him gently in the ribs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come quick!" whispered the Kanaka</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensely when he saw that his master was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully awake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Markenson, sensing something unusual,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed up his automatic and followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. At the base of the cliff the Kanaka</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted and pointed upward. Markenson</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw back his head and saw outlined in</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear relief against the graying sky a swing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, swaying object that he could not quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">identify. That it was not a man he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain, for the thing possessed none of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">general forms of a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that some one was fooling with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grapnel line was plainly apparent; more-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, it was evident that the object, what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever it was, would soon disappear over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the cliff. In haste Markenson threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his automatic and emptied its contents</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the rapidly ascending object. Hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the reports of the shots died away when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shower of fine, granulated substance came</seg><seg type="columnLine">raining down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Frankie Blue's brown skin had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of such a thing it would at that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">instant have transformed itself to a livid</seg><seg type="columnLine">white.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The sacred meal! Buwani! Buwani!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he screamed, and dashed away yelping at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of his lungs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jarvis, awakened by the uproar of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">firing and the Kanaka's yelling, came rush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For heaven's sake! What's up?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped, groping wildly for his glasses, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found at the end of their ribbon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clapped them to his nose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Markenson's answer was a disgusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunt. Going to the fire he shortly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned with a blazing brand, and by its</seg><seg type="columnLine">light stooped and scooped together a palm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful of the substance that had fallen on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the boatswain's heads.

They had hardly sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to a hastily prepared breakfast, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee and bread could be called a break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast, when a deep booming sound assailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ears. Coming on them so abruptly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was positively disconcerting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They twisted their heads this way and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in an effort to fathom the mystery, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make neither heads nor tails of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was not the booming report of a gun they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were quite sure, though small cruisers fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently put in at Tamana; it possessed more</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Madness of Johnny Dyer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the ringing qualities of a bell, yet it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlike the sound of any bell they had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard. The first few notes were intermit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent, each note complete and distinct in</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, then they blended into a continuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird singing noise of great volume. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">that desolation of hills and jungle it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncanny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It gives a fellow the creeps," whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jarvis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For fully fifteen minutes the sound con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued, then died down to a whisper and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally ceased altogether.

They did</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear, however, sometimes at night and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes during the day, the weird, boom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sound; but they did not connect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">missing Dyer with the booming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of the third day following his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumble into the "well" Markenson pro-,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced himself fully recovered, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove the assertion he picked the doctor up</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodily and threw him across his big shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders with ease. That was sufficient proof of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fitness, so they agreed to make a start</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BY DAYLIGHT of the next day</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had finished breakfast a*hd</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a torch of dry twigs; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">again taking up their packs they started</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the "door to hell," as Markenson ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed it. Tying back the vines at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point where the stairs began Markenson</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit the torch and led the way down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The center of the step6 was deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">grooved, proving that they had been used</seg><seg type="columnLine">very extensively in their day. The sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the "well" were composed of small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothly-hewn stones, damp and cold to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the touch, and thickly studded with niter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which glittered like diamonds in the fitful</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of the torch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arriving at the bottom of the stairs, about</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty steps in all, they found themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking into a dark, forbidding tunnel the</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of which was barely sufficient to per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit the big agent to walk upright. Into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel they plunged, and at the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">five minutes they turned an abrupt curve</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw a faint light ahead. Hurrying on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they presently stepped out into the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The light was rather feeble, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">owing to the fact that it filtered in at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of a narrow crevasse about two hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet long and more than a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet deep. It was for all the world as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were standing at the bottom of a tall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">chimney of unusual and erratic dimensions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Plainly the crevasse was the work of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrestrial convulsion, and owing to a freak</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that convulsion the crevasse could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen only by approaching it through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel or from the top of the rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first glance it appeared that the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">was blocked. But Jarvis, who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking around, suddenly caught his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion excitedly by the arm and pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a narrow fissure extending from top to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom at one side of the crevasse. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular intervals up this fissure thick iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods had been embedded in its sides, thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming a ladder of sorts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will be like climbing a Jacob's-ladder</seg><seg type="columnLine">to heaven!" cried Jarvis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the only way up," said Markenson</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly; "so let's be at it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jarvis, as the lighter man, elected to</seg><seg type="columnLine">start first. He stepped on the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">round of the ladder and began the ascent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">testing each round of the ladder carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">before trusting his weight to it. Marken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son soon followed. To the man who has</seg><seg type="columnLine">not had his share of perilous feats the</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing of such a ladder up a narrow crack</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the earth might present drawbacks; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">to men who on numerous occasions had</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced death in various guises the feat was</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely one of those prosaic incidents that</seg><seg type="columnLine">go with a day's work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the two men stepped from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack at the top of the rock and stood work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the cramps from their limbs and looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about them. Their eager eyes beheld a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene of gorgeous beauty. They surmised</seg><seg type="columnLine">that at the moment they were standing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lip of the crater of an extinct volcaao,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the diameter of the crater almost equal to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the diameter of the rock, about two miles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In truth, Big Rock itself was no less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upstanding, colossal throat of the volcano.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the hp the crater at every point</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its circumference swooped sharply down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a depth of fifty feet or more, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">leveled itself and flowed away, a beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat plain carpeted with a verdant growth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of grass, with here and there clumps and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows of bushes and trees of variegated</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors. The whole appeared as a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">digious bowl, upon the inner surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which a gigantic artist had painted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pastoral scene of surpassing beauty; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the immensity of the picture impressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself upon the two spectators they gasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with wonder and appreciation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Madness of Johnny Dyer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what surprised them even more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused further exclamations to leap from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lips was the solitary, two-story build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that stood in the very center of the bowl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover, from the building a thin column</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smoke drifted lazily into the still air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Buwani!" cried the man of medicine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Johnny!" echoed Markenson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They both laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now if I were an archeologist I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that we have discovered something</seg><seg type="columnLine">valuable," went on the agent, after an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terval. "Once I entertained a party of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tourists here at Tamana, and among them</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a Professor Dawes, who informed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the islands in the Pacific were once</seg><seg type="columnLine">component parts of an extensive continent</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintaining a superior civilization."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's your evidence," said Jarvis, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicating the building with a nod of his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"However, let's find Johnny; we can sift the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence afterward."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We haven't seen any evidence of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">having a gun," said Markenson as they pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared to go on, "but that's no sign he hasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. Crazy men are not apt to be dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">criminating, so let's be careful."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They made their way to a point on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lip of the crater several hundred yards far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther along, where a row of trees extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the side of the bowl and across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain to within a hundred or so feet of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building. Down they plunged, using the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees as concealment, and at last stood but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short distance from the building. Clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">now they saw that the structure before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them was of heroic proportions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had the general appearance of one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the community houses of the Navaho In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dians,. but instead of the adobe brick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud of the Navaho houses this building</seg><seg type="columnLine">was constructed of the small stones similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">to those they had seen in the "well" beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliff. They scrutinized the place closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">but saw no sign of human habitation except</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wisp of curling smoke rising from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof. Suddenly a rumbling boom broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silence, and courageous though the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were, they instinctively shrank. Jar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vis whipped out his automatic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on!" cried the agent in alarm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeping the gun down with a quick motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his hand. "Don't get excited and plug</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny, little man!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a shame-faced grin Jams replaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun in its holster. The boom ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the single stroke, but in its stead, as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">if to further play upon their taut nerves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came from the interior of the building</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mocking laugh. Markenson swore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on!" he said savagely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Therewith, gritting their teeth, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">marched out from the shelter of the trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made for the building. As they went</seg><seg type="columnLine">they heard the mocking laugh again, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and again, and at last it ended in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">series of croaking, derisive guffaws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The poor, poor devil," muttered Jarvis</seg><seg type="columnLine">compassionately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jarvis had heard such sounds before issu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the lips of madmen and knew of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great disaster that lay behind them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny was doubtless a babbling, slobber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing idiot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without mishap they reached the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and entered by one of the several doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">on that side. They stepped inside with</seg><seg type="columnLine">every sense alert, every muscle tensed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for instant action should occasion</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrant. As men go, Dyer was not a giant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but life in the open had developed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the ordinary and he was as tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">as wire nails. In a scrimmage he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt prove himself a wicked if not</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether triumphant adversary, so dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cretion was indeed the better part of valor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the light reflected into the building</seg><seg type="columnLine">from outside the two men had no difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">in finding their way about. The room in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they stood was spacious and bare of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all furnishings, unless a rough ladder stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in one corner, which lost itself in a trap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">door affair in the ceiling, could be called</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnishings. From room to room they</seg><seg type="columnLine">made their cautious way, hearing no sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">except their own footsteps and seeing noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing but the naked walls and floors. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">place seemed to be utterly deserted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up stairs," said Markenson shortly when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had looked into the last room on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He led the way to the room where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had noted the ladder and without hesita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion began the ascent, Jarvis following</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely on his heels. At the top the agent</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused and thrust his head cautiously above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aperture, half expecting to feel a club</seg><seg type="columnLine">come smashing down on his skull. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sort occurred, however, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on up and stepped into a black void.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the room in which they found them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves contained a window or a door it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hermetically sealed; the only light in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place came from the blotch which marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">78</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the trap-door through which they had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">come, and that was negligible. The dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness closed in about them like something</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangible, something that they could feel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut with a knife. Their ears tensed to catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faintest sound, they stood listening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     ABRUPTLY, like a flash from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">V Ty clear sky, the sound came. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">' poured over them like a rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, tumbling and surging and swirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">about them eddies of deafening sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashing and roaring one moment, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next sighing and crying into their ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the wailing of a gale on the open sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> BoomI B-o-o-o-ml It came rushing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">them like an invisible, clutching hand that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would choke the very lives from their bodies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smothering and suffocating them with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">detonations. Beings of flesh and blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">have their limitations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jarvis jerked his ever-ready automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its holster and emptied its contents</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the vast wells of darkness about them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then with a cry flung the weapon from him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaped for the ladder. When almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the bottom of the ladder he lost his foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and fell, sprawling on the floor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room below like a fish stranded on the beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Markenson followed an instant later, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">more fortunate than his companion, landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">right-side-up and ran blindly. Scrambling</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet, the erstwhile dignified physician</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed his big friend into the sunlight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The little doctor was, indeed, a disreputable</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What little clothing he wore was ripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and torn and the grub pack on his back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now twisted awry, was a wreck which per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted its contents to leak out and mark</seg><seg type="columnLine">the path of flight. Over his right eye was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cut from which the blood oozed slug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gishly. Nor was Markenson much better</seg><seg type="columnLine">off. They were both visibly and shock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly scared. At a safe distance from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building they stopped and looked back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jarvis fumbling for his glasses and clamp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them to his nose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A strange sight met their gaze and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">not conducive to relieve their outraged feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings to any appreciable degree. Standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the roof of the building, one foot resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the low parapet and leaning indolently</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a huge wooden maul, stood the missing</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. He was looking down at his two</seg><seg type="columnLine">comrades with an expression of mingled</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise and mirth. But far from being</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">disrobed as they had seen him on a previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion, he was now garbed in the conven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional white duck trousers and soft shirt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gentleman of the Pacific, a wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brimmed straw hat cocked rakishly over</seg><seg type="columnLine">one eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello there, you boobs! Were you look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for some one?" he called down after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long interval of staring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little doctor gulped. Surely such</seg><seg type="columnLine">rational words could not issue from the lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a madman! A further exceedingly mi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nute diagnosis of the madman's face con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced the doctor that Dyer was perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sane; there was none of that wild, aimless</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring so noticeable in the eyes of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentally unbalanced. Markenson was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first of the two to regain control of himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the--" he began, but got no fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther; he choked with wrath and the ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion transformed itself into a violent burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of swearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dyer laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come up and let's talk it over," he in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vited. "You'll find steps on the other side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this shebang."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no alternative, so the two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked around the building to the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and found the steps as directed. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few moments they stood on the roof. Dyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed them suspiciously, holding himself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">readiness for flight or battle at the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs of hostility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is there anything you'd like to know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentlemen?" queried the madman after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His words were the pattern of elaborate</seg><seg type="columnLine">graciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, not a thing, we assure you," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Markenson with biting sarcasm, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sarcasm was lost on Dyer, who grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">good-naturedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the meaning of this foolishness?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded the little doctor angrily, glaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Dyer as if he would eat him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll let Buwani tell you part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story," replied Dyer. "From what I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen of this place I imagine Buwani used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the careful attentions of a priest, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the priest hasn't been around for a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred years or so, I'm filling the job tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porarily. Listen to what Buwani has to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taking the wooden maul he held in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, Dyer walked across the roof to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">object which the others had not before</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed, or if they had noticed it, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Madness of Johnny Dyer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">79</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it of no consequence.

The result was a deep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">resonant boom that literally made the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremble. It was the sound Markenson and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor had heard the first time beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliff. The apparatus was, in fact, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">one-note xylophone on a large scale. Dyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung the maul for a second stroke, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jarvis made the intervening distance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For God's sake let the thing alone!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've had enough of Buwani!" he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I should think so," said the other laugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly, throwing the maul down. "Yet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you must admit it is a wonderful instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, my friend; on a still day its music</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be heard ten miles.

Also</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> he made wide observation of the various</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> methods of turning drunkenness to good</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> account; and he came to look without any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> particular repugnance upon Hendricks'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> specialty, which was that of the "knock-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> out"--not, however, by fistic means.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   One night when fog lay upon the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">82</seg><seg type="columnLine">Square</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">83</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">like a cloak, dulling business in the dance-</seg><seg type="columnLine">halls--already interfered with past all</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason by some new freak ideas of the po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lice--Hendricks drew Jimmy through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side door of the Cobweb, which opened off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office.

Here, where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidewalk was full of men, was a good chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his pursuer to close up on him, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">improved it. When the two turned off</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a side street, they were perhaps fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards apart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This section overlooks the down-town</seg><seg type="columnLine">district, which was flooded with a garish</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow light, at one end of which the ferry</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">building pointed upward like a dully illu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minated monstrous needle. But where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy walked there were few open shops;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the lights from thesef discouraged-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking Chinese restaurants and pawn-shops,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly thrust back the curtain of night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fog was so thick that what few loiter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers there were seemed to be waiting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambush, the hurrying figures loomed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly and then were gone like specters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and everything seemed shrouded in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">folds of mist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was nothing about this that</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveyed a warning to Jimmy; and pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently he passed into an even more desolate</seg><seg type="columnLine">street, where the ramshackle buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have jostled each other to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of tumbling, and there were no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">passers-by at all. Here the white-faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">man lengthened Ins stride, putting his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at the same instant as did Jimmy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so creeping upon him unheard. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the middle of a block, with a swift, noise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less rush, he pounced upon the boy, gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his throat with one hand, and dragged him</seg><seg type="columnLine">sideways into an alley and down upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">^ SUDDEN as was the attack, Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">f* could have cried out, but he didn't.</seg><seg type="columnLine">_E2jThat was another lesson he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">earned at the Cobweb. Noise might</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring regular assistance, but it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">more apt to bring the police, and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces of the law there is no redress for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawless. So he fought like a trapped rat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">squirming, wriggling, scratching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's that money? Turn over that</seg><seg type="columnLine">money?" came in a hiss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You-traitor!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The demand told Jimmy it was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own world that had attacked him, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">speakable treachery, and what little fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had felt was drowned in a rush of rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somehow Jimmy managed to twist his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head until he got his assailant's arm be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween his teeth, and he crunched down</seg><seg type="columnLine">savagely. But the other wrenched his-arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">free, and ground Jimmy's face against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pavement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You--yer worse'n a snitch!" It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the uttermost insult.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt the man's hand pressing into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">trousers pocket, and was suddenly worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the thought that Hendricks' plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be delayed, probably nullified alto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, because of his own lack of alertness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">84</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You petty larceny thief," he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then rescue came, just as Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the dollar fished from his pockets. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">came sauntering along the street in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape of a man who loomed enormous in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gloom. Deftly he reached down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">plucked up the two combatants bodily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pulled them apart. He did it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleness, albeit with absolutely irresistible</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength; and there was a certain large</seg><seg type="columnLine">good humor in his first words that held</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy over his instinctive impulse to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wrench away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Waal, waal, what's the rumpus? Dirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">place to be sploshin' around in. Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the devil!" his tone quickly changing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to anger. "I thought you was both kids.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">What d'ye mean, ye big-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One glance had sufficed Jimmy to classify</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man. The high boots, corduroy trous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers and flannel shirt were unmistakable</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs; and Jimmy knew that, had it been</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighter, the broad, roughly hewn face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rescuer would have shown brick-red</seg><seg type="columnLine">from sun exposure. He was one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">large-hearted, good-natured race whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy had nevertheless learned to despise;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and because he was, Jimmy voiced his ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peal confidently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, mister, he's got-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the gutter-man was of no mind to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait for judgment. At the beginning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy's wail, he had writhed sideways and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted under the restraining arm. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clever dodge, devised primarily for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion of policemen and their ilk, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it wasn't to lie expected the hand of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustic would prevail against it. Like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot, the fellow was off down the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">alley, leaving his erstwhile captor staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupidly after him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Jimmy was not content to stare.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He flung after the fleeing man an entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexpurgated string of epithets, until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">countryman put a protesting hand on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tut, tut!

What the dickens was the mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, anyway?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whereupon Jimmy, realizing there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still possibilities in the situation, choked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back his anger and recalled himself to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical side of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He stole my dollar," he cried as plain-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tively as he knew how.

Will you do</seg><seg type="columnLine">it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I--sure." Jimmy was conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">of feeling unpleasantly and uncharacteris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically solemn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's all right, then." Jimmy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">edging away. "So long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So long," said Jimmy. And, "So long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hick," he flung over his shoulder as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Probably it was perversity that made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him add that last derisive word; but some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else than perversity caused him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Square</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">85</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">voice it so the miner could by no means</seg><seg type="columnLine">have heard it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Jimmy was running up the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">worried a little by the delay, but with cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain other strange emotions crowding his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart, too. Promises made in such a case</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly meant nothing, but as certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was something about this one that</seg><seg type="columnLine">clung to his mind. Maybe it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">miner's use of the word "square," since</seg><seg type="columnLine">squareness was Jimmy's one rule of life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To be square to the gang--but my, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the miner had twisted the meaning of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When you see a man that ain't got no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">chance-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What chance would the dude have--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dude with the plethoric bankroll in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">annexation of which Jimmie's present</seg><seg type="columnLine">errand was to end? The same chance that</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of his predecessors had had, to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">drugged, dragged out, robbed, and left to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mercy of the black alley. Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought with a rather twisted smile how</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly he could redeem his promise if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">chose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PRESENTLY Jimmy, still with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts unpleasantly confused,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned into Pacific Street, hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">up that thoroughfare for a block and a half,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then into a narrow passageway. Up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain rickety flight of steps he climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the second story, rapped softly on a door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and muttered a password. The door</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened, he entered, and came out a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">later with a tiny bottle in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he started down the steps he dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">that bottle, as he had been taught, over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the balustrade upon a little space of soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud that received it without a sound. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done this many times before, super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caution it had seemed; but this time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trick served him well. For as he reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground a heavy hand came out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the stairs and gripped him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's what?

He went</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as the end of the alley. There he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hid, and when he was sure the coast was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear, came back and retrieved the bottle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he ran as fast as he could back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cobweb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went through the side door into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office, signaled the bartender, and Hen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dricks came out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A devil of a fly boy you are!

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not gifted in self-analysis, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirring of his not yet dead moral sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">went unrecognized; but there was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about it from which he shrank. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was easy money, it was fairly safe, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the practise of the gang, and he had accus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomed himself to join in their merriment</seg><seg type="columnLine">over it. But--well, Jimmy's was as yet a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy's inquiring mind, and he sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered, with all the talk of squareness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to whom the gang was really square.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Things in the Cobweb were about as</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual, men and women dancing, men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">women drinking, determined light-hearted-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness everywhere, and all sadness prohibited,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except perhaps in the make-believe human</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. And Jimmy, with just the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud upon his own spirit, peered around</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the tables until he caught sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hendricks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hendricks had already taken his seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was beckoning a waiter, affability per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonified. There were three other men at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his table; two of them Jimmy knew as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hendricks' usual confederates in affairs like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, "Red Sam" and McCarthy. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended victim sat on the other side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hendricks, and Jimmy could see only liis</seg><seg type="columnLine">forearms, lying loosely on the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at sight of those forearms Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">started. Clearly the program had changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his absence, for they were not the fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms of a dude. They were heavy, power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful, and roughly garmented--and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy gasped, for Hendricks had moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his chair, and the face of his prey was</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The waiter was coming with the drinks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On Hendricks' face was a smiling mask; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was talking smoothly, jocularly, entertain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly, as he knew so well how to talk. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">--no, there could be no mistake--the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who listened to Hendricks with a broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile of good-fellowship on his sunburned</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was Jenkins, the stalwart miner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jenkins, the man who had rescued</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy and befriended him without need,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man whose hearty voice and wholesome</seg><seg type="columnLine">words still rang in Jimmy's ears and stirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heart. Jenkins, who had made possible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the success of Jimmy's errand, and by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">act made possible his own undoing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Jimmy? Jimmy's face whitened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tautened. His eyes widened, his lips parted</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though for a warning cry.

Such a fine humorous sense had</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy's gang given him--and to an under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing heart the smile on Jimmy's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been sadder than any tears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A comic twist to the little drama of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night--but, still grinning, Jimmy found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself coming forward between the tables,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as to the force that impelled him to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">this he could not have given a guess.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What was it the miner had said?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When you see a man that ain't got no</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Tip] THE waiter placed the foaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ijjlj glasses.

Provided</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they kept out of the shadows they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe. The miner, with one arm flung about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy's shoulder, started down the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what was this?

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, indeed, all wrong. For to him who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had periled his life to save the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had succored him had come the unutterable</seg><seg type="columnLine">loneliness that only an unprotected boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">can feel, and not unfounded fear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vengeance of the gang that had been his,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, worst of all, remorse. And he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered with something like a curse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Puzzled, the miner questioned him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's the matter? Everything's all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. And that was the gamest tiling, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">squarest tiling-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Square!" cried Jimmy, thinking angrily</seg><seg type="columnLine">that for this stranger's sake he had crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his only friends and trampled his one creed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">into the mire. "Square!

And the end of their talk was this:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Listen, Jimmy," said the miner. "May-</seg><seg type="columnLine">be you saved my life tonight, and maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">not; but anyway, it ain't any reward I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">offerin' you.

"Come on, Billy."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the two slipped into the street where a car</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaited them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was not quite certain that he had in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terpreted the summons aright. The su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perintendent laughed reassuringly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a word of truth in it, Jixnmy. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">excuse to get you out. Enrique is by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time on the roof of the Valdera warehouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the rear of the German legation. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">party-wall extends four feet above the roof,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an excellent screen for him." He held out</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand to Billy. "Good evening, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith. How are you, sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He retained the boy's hand a shade</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer than the occasion seemed to require.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy sensed the reason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If it's not just steady, sir, it's not</seg><seg type="columnLine">90</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves. It's excitement," he said apolo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">getically. "I'm a little tuned up, that's all."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ortega released his hand, smiling to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll do," he remarked. He went on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">very seriously now. "I want to say briefly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this enterprise you are engaging in is</seg><seg type="columnLine">attended with a danger I won't attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">minimize. If you fail Kaufman will in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voke all the power of his Government to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you punished, unless he takes the law</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his own hands and shoots you down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your tracks. He is a resolute, violent man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he would kill you, I believe, without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest hesitation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wouldn't blame him," said Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">coolly. "I would do it if any one tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If he isn't good we'll spank him," put</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Billy gleefully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Don Emilio, mightily pleased, noted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pair was not even considering the pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility of failure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are stopping. Where are we?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">queried Jimmy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A patrol-box. I am going to telephone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just a moment, boys."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ortega stepped out. Jimmy took a look</seg><seg type="columnLine">around from the door, but he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">determine in what part of the city they were.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The superintendent came back. He gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction to the driver, and the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted off. Soon it was going at express</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. There was none to forbid, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of the law sat inside and ruled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ortega spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Herr Kaufman's limousine has left its</seg><seg type="columnLine">garage in the Calle Rosario with lights out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three minutes ago. The minister is in it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took the Avenida Corona. That means</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he will come out on the Santa Marta</seg><seg type="columnLine">Road, travel south, turn east over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arroyo Rebelde, and so into the Avenida</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alejanrino."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And then?" Jimmy shot the question at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One of three things must happen after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaufman enters the house. Otto Stoll,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chauffeur, will turn back over the bridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drive around for a fixed time; or he will</seg><seg type="columnLine">go east on the avenue in the same purpose;</seg><seg type="columnLine">or he will wait in front of the house until</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaufman comes out. I don't think he</seg><seg type="columnLine">will do the second. He will probably do</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first. Yet he may do the third. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">late, it is dark, and there are no houses</seg><seg type="columnLine">near."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And if he does the first or the second?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrogated Jimmy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He will be stopped. A drunken man</seg><seg type="columnLine">will stagger into his path. There will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble--a fight. Both will be arrested</seg><seg type="columnLine">and locked up for the night, and you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">get possession of the car. But if Otto</seg><seg type="columnLine">waits at the house it is not so simple. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">commotion will bring Kaufman out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy caught him up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And there's where I'll come in. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">take care of Otto, and I'll meet Kaufman</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a story to account for my being at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel. He doesn't know me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ortega lifted the curtain at his side and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered out. A street-lamp flashed by, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were again in the dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the Avenida Bella Vista," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">informed them. "It is just south of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Avenida Alejandrino, and is built up only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short distance. We have passed the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. We shall come presently to an open</seg><seg type="columnLine">field--ah, we have reached it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The car slowed down. It turned off to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right, bumped along a few yards, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to a stand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will get out here," said Ortega.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The car had brought up midway of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpaved, weed-choked street that formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a connecting-link between the two avenues.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trees lined it, but there were no buildings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ortega addressed a few words to his driver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after which, with a low "Come" to the boys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he struck off diagonally across the field to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hisjeft. Jimmy and Billy followed. Billy</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the box of cigars clutched to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY came at length to the grove</seg><seg type="columnLine">of conifers that fronted Morales'</seg><seg type="columnLine">house on the south side of the avenue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As they plunged into it a man stepped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the shelter of a tree. Jimmy's hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to his pistol, but he saw that Ortega</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not disconcerted by the apparition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He advanced to the man and held a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">conference with him. At its close the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped away into the darkness. Ortega</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is all right," he said. "We have ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rived in time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I say, Don Emilio," submitted Jimmy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"suppose those others come--the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">'the five'? We can't wait in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house for Kaufman if they do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Move to this side, and say nothing,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ortega replied. "My men will take care</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the other cars. But I've really no hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">For The Flag	91</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of such good fortune. Herr Kaufman</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't want a debating society on his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonight. He will tell Morales what to do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Morales will pass the word along." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">added: "Miss Taylor went out early in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening, and has not returned. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was walking."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you think of it?" Jimmy asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not thinking. I shall have a report</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her later. She was followed. "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were quiet after this, standing well</seg><seg type="columnLine">back among the trees, their ears strained</seg><seg type="columnLine">to catch what sound the night might bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the west. The bell of La Caridad</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat distantly on the still air. Twelve o'-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clock. A while longer they stood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ola!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Ortega calling attention to a shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">looming in the street. It came nearer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">purring gently, and stopped directly across</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them. A smaller shape detached</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself from the larger and moved toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. They could hear the soft tapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">of leather on stone accented with a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">regularity--tip-tap, tip-tap. The house-</seg><seg type="columnLine">door opened, and a man's figure was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed in the faint light of the hall. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A bur-r-r came from the machine. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved off, described a half-circle, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went west.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '•'Quick!" hissed Ortega to the boys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He raced through the trees, running in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a divergent line from the street. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was out of the grove he waved high above</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head an electric-torch three times.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he did not check his steps, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on till they came to the intersecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">by-way. Their car was already there in</seg><seg type="columnLine">response to Ortega's signal. They tumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it, and sat panting for breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What are we waiting for?" gasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy as the machine throbbed under them</seg><seg type="columnLine">but did not stir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To give the others time. We don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to come up until they have taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">Otto away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For five minutes by Ortega's watch they</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed where they were. Then--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Vayase!" he barked at the man in front.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was at the east end of the bridge that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came upon the limousine. A man</seg><seg type="columnLine">saluted as they drew up. Ortega ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed a few hurried words with him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they got out into the road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stoll kicked up a row, but they quieted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him," said Ortega grimly. "Can you man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age this machine of Kaufman's?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Billy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure. I can drive it in my sleep."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Try it out--over the bridge and turn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You haven't many minutes to spare, it may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy jumped into the driver's seat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"'Ware there!" he cried to the man in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He switched on the head-lights for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge, crossed it, and tore into the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jimmy," said Ortega gravely, "it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">rests with you now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right you are, Don Emilio," Jimmy re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined cheerfully. "Don't worry. You'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear from me before day. Where shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy leave the car?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some one will be waiting here for it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't let Mr. Smith delay. I shall want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know how you got along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy was coming back. He shut off</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lights after crossing the bridge, and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a stop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Runs smooth as silk," he remarked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I haven't forgotten the cigars, Jimmy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They're on the seat with me." He sniggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">mischievously. "I hope our guest will</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the brand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The policeman standing near muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to himself. Cigars! They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking of in a time like this, these Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cans!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must go," said Ortega. "Good</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck, my friends. I will stay here till you</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass. Should anything happen that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't control fire one shot. I will come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no matter what the cost."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wrung their hands. Jimmy got in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Billy let the car slide easily away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He made a turn when he came to Morales'</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, and came up to the walk headed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bridge. A dim fight showed over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door; otherwise the place was dark for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could see. At least fifteen minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed since Kaufman entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. He might not issue from it for half</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour--an hour--longer even. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">this uncertainty, the delayed action, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore heavily on the two. One thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, seemed assured. There were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be no other visitors this night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They talked in hushed tones, Jimmy de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tailing to Billy the procedure he had deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined on. Then he pushed the door open</seg><seg type="columnLine">noiselessly, and squatted on the rear seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">next to the walk like a frog ready to leap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">92</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">From the heart of the city after a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the sentinel call of the great church-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell. One stroke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is that one o'clock or half-past twelve?</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seems a year," whispered Billy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The half-after," Jimmy answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They fell silent again. Jimmy stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself out on the seat to ease his stiffened</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs. The minutes passed. Again the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clock boomed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tsitl" Billy gave a warning sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The house-door was opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy cautiously drew himself up to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">former crouching posture, every nerve taut</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a fiddle-string. The door closed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the limping-tap of leather on stone followed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaufman was coming to his car. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttering to himself in German, angrily</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed. Something had gone wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His short, paunchy form was at the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. His foot was on the running-board.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His head came in at the door, then his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders, stooped to clear the lintel. His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were directed to the supposed Otto sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the wheel. He was in the act of giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a command when one hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty pounds of solid beef and bone crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on his neck and flattened him to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. At the precise instant the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">started off, the door swinging wide, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Imperial German envoy's feet kicking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Easy as two and two," crowed Billy</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JIMMY snapped on the ceiling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. He had one minute in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do the work he meditated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaufman's wind was knocked out of him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he would be getting it back, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble would begin. Jimmy felt for one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the German's hands, found it, jerked it</seg><seg type="columnLine">rudely up over his spine, and slipped it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the noose of a stout cord he had laid out</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully on the seat in advance. He found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other hand and bound if securely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey, what's the matter?" he yelped at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy, and snapped off the light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The car had stopped at the bridge. Billy</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke to some one in the street. His voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was coolly urgent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut that door, please. We've got a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick man inside."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Imperial Minister was shoved un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently on his nose to the farthest limit of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor, and the door closed against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">protesting feet. Kaufman bellowed in in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">articulate rage, crazed with the misad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture that had befallen him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They passed the cane huts that fringed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city, and took up the Santa Marta</seg><seg type="columnLine">Road. Jimmy switched on the ceiling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light again. He bent over Kaufman and</seg><seg type="columnLine">exerting all his strength raised him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plumped him into the seat-corner. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplished he ran his hand over his cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive's person, and when it came away there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a neat hammerless in it. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked at him. His heavy-lidded eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot out venomous sparks. Spittle slimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his beard. A great guttural oath broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his snarling lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did he say?" Jimmy asked Billy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'd hate to tell you," grinned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke to Kaufman in his own tongue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A duel of words followed, and suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended. Kaufman had regained in a degree</seg><seg type="columnLine">his self-control and he had found his En-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glish. He delivered it at Jimmy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You shall answer for this, you scoundrel!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both of you. And bitterly. My person</seg><seg type="columnLine">is sacred. I represent his Imperial Majesty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kaiser, at this capital."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wish," said Jimmy evenly, "you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in actuality that infamous man. Fortunate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly for yourself you are not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've told him he's a prisoner of war,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered Billy; "that he has conspired against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Government of the United States; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that until we have dug up all the deviltry</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has set agoing he won't see his happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">home again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bah!" spat out Kaufman. "The city</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be aroused tomorrow. You will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">apprehended, punished. I shall see to that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You--release my hands! I command you!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy gave him a cold smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't seem to take us seriously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herr Kaufman. You will do so later.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is all I have to say to you now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He settled himself in his corner with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">minister's own pistol resting lazily in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and ignored the flow of threats di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rected at him. They ceased shortly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the hum of the big machine devouring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the miles disturbed the silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dipping down of the car told Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had come to the ravine on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side of which lay the farm.

Back of Winifred, to one side, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge frame of the negro Sam was lined</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the gray front of the building.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy jumped down from the car. Billy</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here we are, sir," Jimmy said to Brewer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is my friend and fellow-American,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr.-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better not!" cautioned Billy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Blank," finished Jimmy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brewer understood.

In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">early hours of the evening-- at forty min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes after eight, to be exact--Miss Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taylor slipped secretly out of the house in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Avenue Alejandrino, and walked rapid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly in the direction of the Calle Central.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was supposed to be writing letters in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her room; she had in fact, given out that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she would be so engaged for at least two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If her absence was discovered mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">while she would account for it in some off-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand way--a little stroll in the near neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">borhood to rest her after her labors with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her pen. Dona Natalia, simple soul, took</seg><seg type="columnLine">her for an eccentric anyway, and Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manuel knew her for a self-reliant person</seg><seg type="columnLine">amply able to look out for herself in dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">or day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Taylor had good reason for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">secrecy this night. Mrs. Isaacs had sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied her with the reason and after weighing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to a nicety, she was convinced that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound and valid. They must confer to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether without delay. She walked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">engrossed with her thoughts, and gave only</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unafraid glance to the shuffling mestizo</seg><seg type="columnLine">she overtook on her way along the avenue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man's gait quickened the least bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she passed him. When she reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Calle Central he was but fifty feet be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind her. He lit a cigaret with an erratic</seg><seg type="columnLine">flourish of the match, and continued at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">much slower pace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Taylor turned south on the Calle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Central. A man loitering across the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen the brandished match, and loafed</seg><seg type="columnLine">along toward the south. The supposi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titious half-breed retraced his steps up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenue. It was his beat for the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Taylor pursued her way and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts. She was casting over again her</seg><seg type="columnLine">94</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">interview with Mrs. Isaacs that afternoon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was, in final review, summing up each</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, each look of the little woman. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, she decided, in harmony throughout,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crowning all was one indisputable fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">certified to by Morales when, on his arrival</seg><seg type="columnLine">home before dinner, he had given her an</seg><seg type="columnLine">account of Mrs. Isaacs' call on him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. Yes, beyond doubt, it was wise</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep this rendezvous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She began questioning the street names</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the corners, for she was drawing near to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Calle Dolores. She came to it with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next block, followed it east until opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">the park, found the number she had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">given and, as instructed, tapped lightly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. Mrs. Isaacs herself responded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the knock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment afterward the man loitered</seg><seg type="columnLine">along. He made a swift examination of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the premises at No. 140, and lounged over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the park. He glanced about, and moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bench from one of the paths into the deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows of a clump of shrubbery. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were but a few persons passing through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">park. The number grew less as time went</seg><seg type="columnLine">by, and finally the place was abandoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all save the concealed watcher on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bench.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night was warm and still, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man yawned wearily more than once. La</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caridad struck ten, then the half-hour.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The house gave no outward sign of life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man caught himself nodding now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, and straightened up; but he nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and again, and at length his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell forward on his breast and stayed there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At 10:50 the door of No. 140 opened, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">an insignificant little figure stepped out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The door was shut noiselessly. It could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened only from the inner side unless one</seg><seg type="columnLine">was provided with a latch-key. Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isaacs flitted off in the dark toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Calle Central where she hoped to find a cab.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eleven o'clock from the cathedral bell</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinged its way into the consciousness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man on the park-bench. He roused guilti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. He had slept for twenty minutes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What had happened in the meantime?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was in for a grilling at the central office</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the woman he had followed had slipped him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he looked he saw that the thin strip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light he had noted below the drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">window-shades was gone. And so was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, it was probable, unless--another</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought--she was spending the night there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He crossed over to the house. The street</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was deserted, and he resolved on a bold</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedient. He advanced to the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rang the bell. He could hear it shrilling</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere in the rear. It went unan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered. He tried the door softly, and rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">again--three times at half-minute inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vals. There was no response. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed at himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They sleep well, these people," he mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered. "Either she is gone or she remains</seg><seg type="columnLine">till morning." He reflected a moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Two women! There would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave-takings. Always there is that. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would have heard. I was but nodding.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She rests here for the night. It is a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainty. I will wait and see. Twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes only. Pah! And two women!</seg><seg type="columnLine">My skin is saved."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hugged this comforting assurance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself, and returned to his vigil on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bench resolved to stick it out till morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and note who should come forth from this</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil's hutch constructed solely to keep an</seg><seg type="columnLine">honest man from bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inside the house Miss Mary Taylor lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched out on a couch in the living-room</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunk in a soundless sleep consequent on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass of claret she had swallowed when</seg><seg type="columnLine">making ready to take her departure. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wine was to have fortified her against her</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk home. Mrs. Isaacs, in sisterly com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">radeship, had drunk of it with her, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">without untoward results it appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bosom of Miss Taylor's dress gaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">open in unseemly fashion. A small pearl</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip pistol lay on the floor beside the couch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A jeweled bracelet-watch encircled her</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist, and a ring of value her finger. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have imagined that a pillaging-hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been busy with the young woman's toi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let, and yet, strangely enough, had spared</seg><seg type="columnLine">an obvious loot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON THE party-wall between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valdera warehouse and the Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man legation was a broken weather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beaten soap-box. Some one had carelessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown it up on the wall at a forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">period and there, a worthless derelict, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had persisted ever since. Enrique Segovia</seg><seg type="columnLine">hailed the box as a boon. Its coverless top</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced him, and through a rent in the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could command the legation roof, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head sheltered as by a hunter's blind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not fifteen yards distant was the flag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pole. Five yards farther on the breast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">high parapet was outlined to his eye. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">For The Flag</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">95</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flagpole rose thirty feet above the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">well over the surrounding buildings, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was supported by guy-rods from midway</seg><seg type="columnLine">its length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was a long, soul-harrowing wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">Segovia had to endure, for it was not until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quarter-hour after twelve that any</seg><seg type="columnLine">move was made within the enemy's terrain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had been sorely tempted to go over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut down the pole out of hand, but decided-</seg><seg type="columnLine">against it. They might find other means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising the antenna, and his work would go</seg><seg type="columnLine">for nothing--he would not have another</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance at the wireless. They would see to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now at last his patience was rewarded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The scuttle opened, and two men appeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They spoke in German, not loud, yet with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no great suppression of voice. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain that fear of eavesdroppers did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturb them. One of them walked to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parapet and peered into the street. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other came toward the party-wall. Segovia</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed, from his square-cut figure, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was Gustave Landeker, for he knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">legation attaches by sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He crouched and held his breath, feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the rubber-covered handle of the hatchet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his belt. But Landeker, or whoever it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, gave a perfunctory survey of the ware-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house-roof, and went back. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had returned to the flagstaff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Segovia was up again viewing them</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his box. He saw them lift a</seg><seg type="columnLine">board off what seemed to him a long wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">slit in the roof; he saw them loosen the guy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods and unstep the pole as they would a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mast and lower it through the opening;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after ten minutes more or less he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pole rise, the men lay hold of it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunting with the effort, replace it in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">socket; for now the pole was topped with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fan-shaped collection of wires upheld by</seg><seg type="columnLine">an insulator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The legation would be calling the camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Arraca presently, and it was not hard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess the news they would send. To pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent this was the task set for Segovia, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he realized that only by unexampled good</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortune could he accomplish it. Here were</seg><seg type="columnLine">two sturdy men, armed no doubt. Either</seg><seg type="columnLine">one was his match in strength. Either one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was persuaded, would go to any length</seg><seg type="columnLine">to defeat his purpose. If he should leap</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall they would be upon him before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could advance a yard. And then! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a silent, straining struggle in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which he would be worsted--unless he</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied the murderous weapon at his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a sickening thought, and Segovia</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrank from it. And yet delay spelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">failure. He imagined--so wrought up was</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fancy--that he could hear through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open hatch the spark-balls crackling in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellar far below. He was about to risk all</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vault the wall, trusting to his felt-shod</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet to land him silently, when he saw one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Germans go to the scuttle and pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pare to descend through it. He waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With but a single man to deal with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances of success would be enhanced a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred-fold. The man descended. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other idled about, humming a snatch from</seg><seg type="columnLine">an opera. Segovia recognized it--from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tannhauser, the "Pilgrims' Chorus." How</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly secure the fellow felt!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man was approaching the party-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. Segovia instantly conceived a plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">of action. He marked in his mind the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">at which the man was likely to pull up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatted low and backed away, paused a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vital moment to gather his energies, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled himself at the barrier and over it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His hope was to catapult into the other and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowl him off his feet, or, if not that, so to</seg><seg type="columnLine">disconcert him that he could not take an</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediate offensive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a miss on both counts. Segovia</seg><seg type="columnLine">botched the jump. His toe caught on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top course of bricks, and he tumbled in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heap on the opposing roof. Before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could recover himself a pistol-butt ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered on his head. A quiver ran through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his limbs, and he was whisked away out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his senses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came to himself in a lighted back-room</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the legation building. Some one was</seg><seg type="columnLine">trickling raw brandy down his throat from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flask. He choked and coughed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened his eyes. He was stretched out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor with a chair cushion under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. The man bending over him raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. An ironical smile curved his lips.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He spoke in Spanish, but with a pronounced</seg><seg type="columnLine">accent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, you recognize me, I see, senor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gottfried Neiderlein," Segovia mum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your devoted servant, Lieutenant. Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">Enrique Segovia. Let me congratulate</seg><seg type="columnLine">you on your recovery. Gustave was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little afraid that the medicine he adminis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered was too potent." He paused, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">96</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his unpleasant smile persisted. "Well,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he continued, "we still go on, Senor Lieu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He strode to the door, and opened it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The hum of a dynamo charging the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">densers of the wireless in the cellar stole</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the room. Segovia clenched his teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stifle a groan. He had failed miserably</seg><seg type="columnLine">and completely. The man returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is water in the corner," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You may wish to use it.

You threaten?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I counsel. My friends, good Herr</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neiderlein, are not all dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bah! You have invaded the legation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His excellency will know how to require</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction. Meanwhile your friends can</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistle on the doorstep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neiderlein marched out, and the key</seg><seg type="columnLine">rasped in the lock after him. Acting on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">man's advise Segovia reached for the brandy</seg><seg type="columnLine">flask and drank from it direct, slowly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparingly. It put life into him, and he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and took stock of himself. He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">relieved, of course, of his hatchet and pistol.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But otherwise he was not disabled--his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones were sound. He went over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wash-stand in the comer, and surveyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in the mirror suspended above it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned from the picture in disgust.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His face was grimed with the dirt of die roof,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and streaked with blood from a gash over</seg><seg type="columnLine">one eye; and his head behind the right ear</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wofully bruised. It was the mark of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gustave Landeker's vehement attention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Segovia washed the grime from his face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and used some of the brandy as a lotion for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wounds. After this he resumed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair and lighted a cigaret. Half an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">went by. Neiderlein unlocked the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked in. Segovia fancied there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an air of uneasiness about him. Neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke, and the German, after an irresolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause, went away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Segovia knitted-his brows. Had Neid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erlein lied about Kaufman? Had Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded in as great a degree as he him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self had failed? Ah, then the legation</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have something to wire Arraca that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was news indeed! He was jubilant with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought. He forgot his own failure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own unease of body, and reveled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the growing assurance of his friend's tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umph. Singularly enough not once did</seg><seg type="columnLine">the image of Mary Taylor present itself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except in the merest shadowy outline--</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inconclusive background figure in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirring canvas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was striking two when Neiderlein again</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared in the door. Segovia was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced that he was correct in his deduction</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerning Kaufman. The man was plain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly worried. He entered, and stood re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garding his captive with a lowering face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have come with a message for me</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his imperial excellency?" questioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Segovia mockingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neiderlein strode over to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is he?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Segovia raised his eyes in surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is who?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Herr Kaufman."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, has he gone?

"Just plain Billy Smith, sir--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy to my friends. Miss Brewer hasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">called me so yet, but I'm hopeful."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy glanced at Winifred. Her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dancing. It was a new phase of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, and he could have hugged Billy for</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing it forth. And he heard from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brewer a foreign sound. The man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing! Not loud, but in a stifled sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of way as though he was fearful of letting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unaccustomed emotion have free play.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will do it for her, Billy--for us both,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brewer said. "And we shall hope to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">you back soon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's that what bothers me," replied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy. "How am I going to get back? If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hire a machine it will be like trailing an</seg><seg type="columnLine">anise bag 'cross country for the hounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow; and to walk is a pretty stiff stroll</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a chap out of training."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are not coming back, not right</seg><seg type="columnLine">away," Jimmy told him. "You are to stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">in town and pick up news. There'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">doings today if I'm not mistaken."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We could send Sam in for him after</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark," suggested Brewer. "Billy could</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk out on the Santa Marta Road and</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet him. I'd go myself, but I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Winifred had turned thoughtful. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was debating a point that had suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think," she said slowly, "it would be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise thing to do if you both went back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think that Mr. Perry ought to be seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">around town tomorrow. It would throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them off the track, perhaps, though I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">not sure. I am afraid they will have a clue</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Herr Kaufman's whereabouts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy directed a startled look at her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A clue!" he exclaimed. "The tiling was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done absolutely without a hitch. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">clue could he have left?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It isn't that," Winifred said. "Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">positive. It's a clue by inference. It did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not occur to me until Mr. Smith--until</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy--explained why he came tonight</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of Mr. Segovia. Tell me, is this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Taylor tall, with close-cut yellow hair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and eyes like--like tourmalines--some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times--and again like-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Like Prussian blue," interpolated Billy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, yes!" Jimmy made an eager step</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward. "You have seen her? Where?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here. It was yesterday, after you had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. She drove in with another woman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She expressed surprise at finding the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied. She said she'd been told it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quaint old house, and she desired to see it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy dashed his fist into his palm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here indeed was a discovery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I met her as I was going out," he cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She simply wanted to learn what brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">me here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, she didn't learn," gave out</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brewer. "We didn't ask her in. I let her</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that she wasn't welcome."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the last thing he should have done,</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided Jimmy; but he did not voice it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winifred was speaking to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I did not think anything of it at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. I put her visit down to idle curiosity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And even now I don't just understand what</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought her. You are a stranger in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Cortina-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Spying is the woman's business," inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted Jimmy. "And I'm a friend of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Enrique. It was enough for her. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't overlooking any bets. And I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracking her up to you only that morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heavenly powers!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laughed ruefully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The least little glimmer of complacency</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightened the girl's eyes; but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly quenched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     "OF COURSE you couldn't know,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     she said.

That would set 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">back a peg or two!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy looked dubiously at Winifred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I reckon it's the thing to do, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves you short-handed here.

"And anyway, Sam and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can relieve each other at Kaufman's door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winny may go to bed when she likes."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy hesitated still. He was frowning</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his swift-succeeding thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tonight won't matter, I suppose," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">98</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On developments."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kaufman glowered at him from under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushy brows. He knew what was implied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have done this thing at the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance of the Zanhorian Government.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You are in its pay."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wrong," Jimmy answered. "I did it</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my individual responsibility. I am not</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the pay of any Government. I am a</seg><seg type="columnLine">private American citizen. It came to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge that you were making mischief</seg><seg type="columnLine">for America. I decided to put a spoke in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your wheel. I've done it. Whatever the</seg><seg type="columnLine">consequence I am willing to assume it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I will repeat, Mr. Minister, what my</seg><seg type="columnLine">young friend said to you in the car: you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain here until the plot you have hatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">against my country is uncovered. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">that-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will pay a price for this," thrust in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaufman wrathfully. "You will all pay!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And it will not be reckoned in gold. Ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">damml Amerikander schwdn!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He clutched a chair with a hairy hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave it a twirl, and sat down with his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliberately turned to them. Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned at Brewer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The gentleman's pleasant way of bid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ding us goodnight," he remarked. "Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">us go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They left the German sitting as he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and closed the door on him. Brewer shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a bolt on it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I put it there," he said. "And this, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is my work. We shall want to know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes on in there." He indicated a slit</seg><seg type="columnLine">sawed in the door. A slide was arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cover it at will.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Agood idea--bangup," declared Jimmy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he could see the man warm to the praise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sam, here is a little something I promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">you." A yellow coin was pressed into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">negro's great paw. "Suppose Sam takes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first watch until we can decide on a sched-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ule," he suggested to Brewer. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly necessary, perhaps, but it is just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well to let Kaufman know that we intend</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep an eye on him from the start."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Exactly," agreed Brewer. "Sam, fetch</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chair. And mind you don't go to sleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If that person gets away it's a hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter for all of us. Do you understand?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I does, Boss," Sam replied with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnestness that denoted a literal interpre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation of the portentous words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy chuckled to himself as they went</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> up the hall to the living-room, into which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy and Winifred disappeared. Brewer</seg><seg type="columnLine">was certainly blossoming out into another</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Jimmy was glad for Brewer's sake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Winifred's sake, and--yes--for his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake. It was hard lines to be condemned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to contempt for the father of the girl he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">so strongly drawn to. He was genuinely</seg><seg type="columnLine">rejoiced to see this change in Brewer. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leaven that had worked it was the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspiriting aspect of the case. It had lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse men to redeeming heights of honor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and repute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HBILLY was inspecting the guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ortega had sent out. He had intro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced himself to Winifred in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own proper name, and explained why it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was he had taken Segovia's place in the car.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His light-hearted way of projecting events</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the screen of his personal preoption of</seg><seg type="columnLine">results was irresistible, and Winifred smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite the anxiety that rested on her in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knowledge of the grave step to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they all were committed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy seemed to regard it simply as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">harum-scarum adventure that would make</seg><seg type="columnLine">good reading in a magazine. Or it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been that he was making little of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger in an effort to comfort her. Women,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Billy's well-matured opinion, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures of small courage; otherwise why</seg><seg type="columnLine">should they take fright at a mouse, or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred harmless creeping tilings he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">name?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," he was saying, "they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">set up an awful holler at the legation when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they find old Doctor Kaufman is missing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their midst; but what can they do?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who is going to tell them where he is?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Echo answers--'Who-o-o'?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Winifred laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suppose she answers 'Here'?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy patted the Mauser he was holding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, then, we may have a use for this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But don't you worry, Miss Brewer.

She said she'd been told it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quaint old house, and she desired to see it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy dashed his fist into his palm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here indeed was a discovery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I met her as I was going out," he cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She simply wanted to learn what brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">me here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, she didn't learn," gave out</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brewer. "We didn't ask her in. I let her</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that she wasn't welcome."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the last thing he should have done,</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided Jimmy; but he did not voice it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winifred was speaking to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I did not think anything of it at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. I put her visit down to idle curiosity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And even now I don't just understand what</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought her. You are a stranger in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Cortina-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Spying is the woman's business," inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted Jimmy. "And I'm a friend of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Enrique. It was enough for her. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't overlooking any bets. And I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracking her up to you only that morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heavenly powers!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laughed ruefully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The least little glimmer of complacency</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightened the girl's eyes; but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly quenched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     "OF COURSE you couldn't know,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     she said.

She has an engaging</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">manner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Part of her equipment," snorted Jimmy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Brewer is dead right, Jimmy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You must go with me. Sister Mary will</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin to gossip as soon as she learns Kauf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man has turned up missing. Say, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a joke to go into Morales' bank and get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bill changed. Gosh! That would set 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">back a peg or two!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy looked dubiously at Winifred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I reckon it's the thing to do, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves you short-handed here. You must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be dead for sleep. And you, Mr. Brewer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1 don't fancy the thought-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We slept in the afternoon," put in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brewer briskly. "And anyway, Sam and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can relieve each other at Kaufman's door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winny may go to bed when she likes."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy hesitated still. He was frowning</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his swift-succeeding thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tonight won't matter, I suppose," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">100</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">conceded. "It's the day that worries me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the Taylor woman does suspect us we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have those Germans out here for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescue."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've got to risk it," declared Billy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The longer we can keep 'em guessing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">better."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," approved Winifred. "And as</seg><seg type="columnLine">father has said, Sam will meet you; only I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think it will be better if it is at noon. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">can go to the post-office, and from there to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Santa Marta Road and pick you up."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sam must stay. He is worth two</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary men. And Kaufman is afraid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. This man Diego who works about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, can he drive your car?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tio Diego!" Winifred smiled. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't coax him into the machine. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">believes it is a contrivance of the evil one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the matter is easily arranged. I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">come for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You!" This did not appeal to Jimmy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He eyed Brewer. "If there should be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble in town-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brewer interposed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Winifred is not afraid. She's not that</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind. And you'd better be going. It will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be getting light in another two hours."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brewer's manner was authoritative.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy bowed to it. Winifred's eyes rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her father with a little flash of pride in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which doubt yet had part; for the miracle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his transformation was a thing so new</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her that she feared to accept it wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lest it pass and leave her in greater depths</seg><seg type="columnLine">than before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy was already at the door impatient</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, Midas, Jr.," he called. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly two. We're wasting time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brewer saw them off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't be uneasy about us," he said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy. "We will keep our end up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By Jove, sir, I'm sure of it," Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">rejoined, and impulsively held out his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they had crossed the ravine, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were burning up the road to town Billy</seg><seg type="columnLine">sundered the silence that reigned between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. He giggled as he spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I was trying to stiffen her spine--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that girl! Thought she was the scary kind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oh, gee!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've a lot to learn, Smith," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy shortly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With a teacher like that? You bet!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The laugh was still on the boy's lips when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car rose up under them, and went wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a perilous moment. Billy cut off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas, and brought it to a grinding halt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy was pitched forward against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windshield. And the singular thing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the car itself pitched and rocked in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious gentle rhythm. The pit of Jimmy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach fell in, and a sickening nausea fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed. Then as suddenly the movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord, what was it?" he gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Automatically he pulled out his watch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The hands pointed to three minutes after</seg><seg type="columnLine">two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A quake," Billy answered. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling sick himself. "We'll wait a minute.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There may be another. They come usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">in pairs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was another, though it was not so</seg><seg type="columnLine">severe as the first. But Billy waited for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time after it had passed. He wished to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make sure that the disturbance was entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the third I've known since I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been out here, and I don't like them," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">volunteered in a strained voice. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">say it's old Borazo yawning--that big</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain back there. Nothing serious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they claim; but I don't know. One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these days he may yawn too long, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then--I guess we can go on now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Hold up!" Jimmy spoke sharply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps we'd better go back to the house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The quake may have damaged it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That old stone barracks! It's been</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing half a century. Old Borazo</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to do more than yawn to bowl</seg><seg type="columnLine">it down. In the city they haven't even</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned over in bed for this baby shock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are used to 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy pressed the starter, and they took</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the road again. Jimmy had nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say until they had left the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind, and crossed the bridge at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arroyo Rebelde. A tropic earth tremor</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not a tongue-loosener for the outlander till</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is thoroughly over his fright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE NIGHT HOURS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">' I 'HEIR headlights picked up a man at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the farther side of the bridge.

The man came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them. His eyes lifted as he saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were two persons in the car, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered no comment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "From the senor superintendent," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Spanish.

"I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the words for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man shrugged in reply to the ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As one stretches himself in his sleep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">senor, no more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see!

"The natives think noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They came to Morales' house, gliding</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly by with lights out. But lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed in the house. They were astir</seg><seg type="columnLine">there at this unseemly hour of the night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy whispered a conjecture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps the legation has been tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phoning.

It was well</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of," he said. "Brewer himself--</seg><seg type="columnLine">will he hold out? I know, as you are aware,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his history."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy was all ears at this. Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he answered briefly. "Have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard from Enrique?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"No. I am a little uneasy about him."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ortegd glanced at a clock on his desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"They raised the wireless two hours ago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Um.

"It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">what she did--used a glass. But pshawl</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm off on that again. Mr. Lane says she's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a harmless little creature. She called on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He left off. Some one was knocking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, insistently, and without pause.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Segovia!" cried Billy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Don Emilio's hand was on the knob,</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening the door. It was Segovia. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood alert and listening on the step for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment. Then he entered and threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself into the first chair. His clothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was torn. The gash over his eye had</seg><seg type="columnLine">recently bled afresh, and his face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stained from it. He breathed in gulping</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By Jove, from your looks you've had</seg><seg type="columnLine">an experience, old man!" exclaimed Jimmy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Here, swallow this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ortega had produced a bottle and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">canted a glass of wine.

"What took</seg><seg type="columnLine">place up there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Srgovia made an apologetic gesture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, yes, of course.

"Did he shoot?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even Ortega laughed, and Billy grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he realized the "bull" he had perpetrated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was at that instant the quake came,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Segovia. "You can imagine what</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened, Don Emilio; Neiderlein is new</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the country. I struck at his arm. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent the weapon flying, and we were at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other's throat. But his fright gave me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage. I got him down to his knees--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to his back--and I battered his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor. I took the pistol, went out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and locked him in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well done," said Ortega. "And then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Segovia continued--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I found my hatchet on a stand outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, together with my pistol. I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what to do then. The cellar stairs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">close by. I ran to them. The wireless</seg><seg type="columnLine">operator was coming up. He, too, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened, but not so that he had lost his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wits. When he saw me he seemed at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">to understand what had passed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hurled Neiderlein's gun at him. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">took him full in the chest. He lost his</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance--there was no rail to hang to--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he went over backward down the stairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a nasty fall, and he didn't move</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward. I thought he was dead, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I couldn't stop to find out. I remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Landeker up on the roof. He'd be coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">down perhaps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"WELL, I found on the operator's</seg><seg type="columnLine">table duplicates of the messages</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd been sending and receiving;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neiderlein load the originals, I suppose. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered them up and stuffed them in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket. Then I went at his condensers</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my hatchet--at his key and spark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">balls. I smashed everything in sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, in some way I can't explain, I cut the</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric light circuit. Anyway, everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">went dark."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gosh!" exclaimed Billy breathlessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was sitting on the extreme edge of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, carried out of himself by the recital.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Segovia went on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had matches, and I struck one. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed me the stairs, and I made for them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wanted to get out of that place. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">one foot on the steps when I felt the other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped by the man on the ground. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to. We had it out, fast and furious.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was hurt; I could tell by his groans. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to break loose from him at last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and climbed the stairs. It was ticklish</seg><seg type="columnLine">business in the dark. When I got up</seg><seg type="columnLine">I didn't know where I was, and I wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the street door. I struck another</seg><seg type="columnLine">match; the door was straight ahead. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">so was Landeker. He was groping his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the cellar. I blew out the match, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seen me, of course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The deuce," fumed Jimmy, as Segovia</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused to light a cigaret. "You can do</seg><seg type="columnLine">that later. Get on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ortega said nothing.

Landeker</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have taken a shot at me, I'm sure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he was afraid that some one was behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and he would hit him. He called out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in German, and Neiderlein set up a cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the room. I could hear Landeker</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming, and dropped to my knees. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky. I caught his legs and jerked them</seg><seg type="columnLine">from under him, and I got a stiff kick in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach as he went over. It pretty nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">did for me, but I was up before he was, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the door. Fortunately it wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked, and I was in the street with a fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">start of Landeker."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you came here direct?" inquired</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ortega gently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not so.

They sent off that Washington</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispatch, of course, and I have a notion</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neiderlein let them know he feared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaufman's safety.

His way home led</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the Calle Dolores. As the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">came abreast of the park the driver uttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a queer exclamation, and threw out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?" demanded Segovia sleepily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mateo, of the force, and a woman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is trouble."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mateo's watch had been rewarded.

The heave of the earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock had penetrated to her deadened con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness, and brought to her the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirrings of awakened life. Slowly, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mental fog in which she was lost, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made her way to thought, then to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaden action in which minutes crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">onward to an hour. And when at last she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was out of the place of her imprisonment</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had stood looking about her bewilder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly, endeavoring to get her bearings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her will to do returned, and she started</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the street in the direction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Calle Central. She reeled weakly--</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunkenly, Mateo thought--and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastened over to her from the park. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had offered, cunningly, to aid her, to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to whatever place she was in mind to go.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The woman had waved him off; had, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, flourished a revolver at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was this sight, as he peered from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine, that caught Segovia's eye. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">got out, and ran forward to the pair. A cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Taylor--Mary! My God!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Enrique!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Taylor thrust the pistol in her waist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and let herself droop toward him.

Oh, take me home!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, yes, at once," Segovia assured her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But what has happened to you? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">are you wandering on the streets--at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour--in this part of the city?

"Drive like the devil, man!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He chafed the girl's hot, dry hands, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no response from her. His senses</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in a whirl. This staggering event</seg><seg type="columnLine">bursting from out the curtain of the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him had scattered his wits. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not think collectively.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Mary's name, softly urgent. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes opened. She pressed the hand holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">hers.

And even</seg><seg type="columnLine">could this incredible thing have happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">io6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the imperial envoy would wish, he knew, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coup to be carried out. To stop it now</seg><seg type="columnLine">would create doubt and suspicion in Pej^</seg><seg type="columnLine">ta's followers. It might, in truth, result</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an irretrievable fiasco. So he let the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yacht come on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as the hours passed without further</seg><seg type="columnLine">word from the legation what at first had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed unthinkable took on the guise of</seg><seg type="columnLine">probability, and finally conviction. Ludolf</seg><seg type="columnLine">summoned to him Sub-Lieutenant Karl</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hecht, told him of the purloined dispatch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the change in Peralta's plans, and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neiderlein's misgivings concerning Kauf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. He added:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is possible that his excellency has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been abducted. I base it on obvious rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons--it would confound the supporters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the revolution. Very well, we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">nullify it. You are to go to Cortina on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning train. Pick four men to accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany you. Learn from Herr Neiderlein</seg><seg type="columnLine">what has been done. He will have made</seg><seg type="columnLine">demands on the Zanhorian Government;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the Government will know nothing--</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course. So, if the whereabouts of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellency has not been discovered, dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover it. Find him. Stop at nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herr Kaufman must be back when I enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city tomorrow. He is the Kaiser's</seg><seg type="columnLine">deputy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN CORTINA a late edition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">La Cronica came out with the news</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Washington in twelve-point</seg><seg type="columnLine">type to make the most of brevity. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">the action of Congress had been discounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in advance by the President's message it</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused but small excitement. It was dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussed mildly at breakfast-tables and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">business offices, and then dismissed. Peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple went about their affairs in the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">leisurely way. On the surface life in Cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tina was rippled only by the stones of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividual desires cast into the tranquil</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters; the events of the night were as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sealed book to the commonalty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in officialdom it was different. Mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters of import occupied it--quietly, cooly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet none the less intensely. President</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hurango sat in secret council in the rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">room of the executive mansion with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretary of state, his secretary of war, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the State superintendent of police. Present</seg><seg type="columnLine">by request was the American minister.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the president's hands was definite in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation of the revolutionary movement--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the arranged day for Peralta's landing, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength of his immediate personnel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aid he counted on in the Province of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Puerto Mono, and in the Provinces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boaca, Espero and Cortina.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Furthermore, President Hurango even</seg><seg type="columnLine">had in his possession on this day, written</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in General Peralta's own scrawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">script, the names of the chief revolutionists</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the state, with the posts promised them</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the new Government. It was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">invaluable paper most unexpectedly de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">livered to him. Indeed, it was the prime</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for the meeting. Secret service</seg><seg type="columnLine">agents were on their way to the provinces</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make arrests.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the capital arrests would not be made</seg><seg type="columnLine">until late in the day. This delay was for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purpose of allowing the report of Herr</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaufman's disappearance to seep privily</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the ears of the conspirators. To first</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismay them, disorganize and sow distrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them, would the more readily bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">confession when they were taken into</seg><seg type="columnLine">custody. Then would be the time to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn Herr Kaufman. Meanwhile all ave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nues of exit from the city were guarded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That the desired intelligence was already</seg><seg type="columnLine">in process of dissemination was indicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a report to the council from the assistant</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretary of state over the president's pri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vate telephone, to wit: Herr Neiderlein had</seg><seg type="columnLine">called at the department with the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the doors to demand the whereabouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the German minister; also to demand</seg><seg type="columnLine">an explanation of the forcible detention</seg><seg type="columnLine">overnight of one Otto Stoll, driver of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">minister's car, and only just released by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the police. Herr Neiderlein's initial de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand, the assistant secretary had reported,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was received with amazed concern, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a protest against the aspersion cast upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government; and to his following demand</seg><seg type="columnLine">assurances of an immediate investigation</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been given, and redress if warranted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">' In brief, Spanish diplomacy had returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herr Neiderlein to his legation as empty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed as he had left it, but with unabated</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion in his heart. And it rankled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more because he knew the secretary was</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing in his sleeve at him for not daring</seg><seg type="columnLine">to voice a third demand--punishment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man who had invaded the legation the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While these events were in progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy Perry opened heavy eyes upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. He yawned and blinked and then in</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer to the insistent call of his subliminal</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, sat up suddenly wide awake. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">fished his watch from under his pillow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the time. The result was a vig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orous pummeling of Billy Smith into re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luctant consciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey, you grandson of the seven sleepers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's after nine," he cried. '-'Shake a leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">there! We've got to get out on the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">and learn the news. And Miss Brewer will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be here at twelve."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy responded querulously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was just dreaming we'd dyed old pop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per Kaufman's whiskers green, and set a</seg><seg type="columnLine">goat loose on 'em. You've spoiled the fun."</seg><seg type="columnLine">They dressed, and started down for</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast. In the corridor they paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stared. Mrs. Isaacs' door stood open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was not a vestige in the room of</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupancy. They crossed over and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in; there were no personal belongings any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where. Everything was in order for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next comer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not even a hairpin left," said Billy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She's found her uncle and gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They questioned a criada who was making</seg><seg type="columnLine">up an adjoining room. She only knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office had sent up word that No. 249</seg><seg type="columnLine">was vacated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to find out where she has</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone," declared Jimmy. "She's given me</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creeps the last two days, that woman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want to know for sure that I'll see no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The clerk on duty was not the polyglot</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Gomez. He spoke but the language</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his fathers. Billy interviewed him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned that Mrs. Isaacs had left on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">7130 Puerto Mono train.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope she doesn't miss the boat," ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed Jimmy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh. There are a dozen stops between</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there," Billy reminded him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Cheer up. Maybe she'll be coming back."</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was half-after ten when they came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from breakfast. They decided on a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gram. Jimmy thought it advisable that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he keep away from the American Legation</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this juncture, but Billy could go without</seg><seg type="columnLine">exciting comment. He was to ascertain</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Mr. Lane what developments, if any,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had occurred in that quarter, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceed via the Calle Cristina to the Santa</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marta Road. Meantime Jimmy, acting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Billy's suggestion at the farm, was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit -the Banco Nacional and show him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to Morales.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy went on his mission. Jimmy waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wi|le, then sauntered over to the post-</seg><seg type="columnLine">office, ^ocght §pme cards for which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no use, and lounged along the Calle Grande</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the bank. If secret eyes were on him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he presented the appearance of one without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a care in the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He strolled into the bank, and spoke to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the teller he had met through Segovia on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his first visit to the place. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed the bill Jimmy tendered, and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed a burning desire to be of further</seg><seg type="columnLine">service. Jimmy inquired casually after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Senor Morales. Perhaps, if he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged. He came to an abrupt pause.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morales' car was at the door, and Morales</seg><seg type="columnLine">was entering the bank. He was late this</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. Jimmy's glance took swift appraisal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him. He discovered, he thought, signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of disquiet in his manner. His thick lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">were compressed, his beady eyes roved from</seg><seg type="columnLine">point to point. They fell on Jimmy as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stepped forward to greet him, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man stopped dead, a baffled expression on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face--the expression of one who has</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted a proposition as logically sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to find it in the same breath logically</seg><seg type="columnLine">refuted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She has told him," Jimmy said to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. To Morales he said blandly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you do, senor? I came in to</seg><seg type="columnLine">change a note."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, yes. Delighted to see you, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perry." Morales stuck out his hand with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great show of friendliness. "Some one--er</seg><seg type="columnLine">--I heard you were leaving town. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad I was misinformed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am leaving shortly," Jimmy said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Got to go home and help lick the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germans." He mischievously put an en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trapping question. "Mrs. Morales--she is</seg><seg type="columnLine">well?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes--er--no, no. I am alarmed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her health, quite upset about it. And it</seg><seg type="columnLine">has deprived me of the pleasure of enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining you at dinner. I fear now-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pray don't concern yourself for that,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy entreated him. "Mrs. Morales'</seg><seg type="columnLine">health is the thing we have to deplore. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in hopes that she was recovered. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is needless to ask if Miss Taylor is well.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She is the picture of health."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The banker did not have himself entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hand on this morning. His brows in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voluntarily contracted. He sought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">counteract it with a voluminous smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Miss Taylor will die of old age--unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">io8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">she meets with an accident," he asserted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Is there anything I can do for you.*Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perry? You have onlyvto Cbmmand</seg><seg type="columnLine">me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were standing precisely at the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they had met. Morales made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">move toward his private office. Jimmy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the welcome guest of a former day, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he chuckled inwardly as he noted it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You are kind, senor, but there is nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could ask of you," he answered. "Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yes, there is," he supplemented quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a devil's impulse: "just mention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Taylor that you saw me, will you</seg><seg type="columnLine">please? And that I sent her my most de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voted regards."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morales' little eyes gave him a needle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like glance. It was instantly hidden in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">urbane inclination of his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You will come again, I trust, Mr. Perry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before you leave the city," he murmured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, most certainly, senor. I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">grieve to think that we were not to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">again." \</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He returned the other's bow, and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now what the deuce made me send</seg><seg type="columnLine">that word to the Taylor woman?" he ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned of himself irately. "I gave my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand away, and the old fox caught on to it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">QS3 IT WAS eleven o'clock. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour to kill. He thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping in on Ortega; if there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">news to be learned that was the fountain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. But he dismissed the notion. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not in his r61e to be seen hobnobbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the police. It occurred to him as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">strolled down the west side of the plaza</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had come to town on a fool's errand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If Mary Taylor had imparted her sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picions to Morales, it was only a question</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hours when an investigation would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">instituted; and his utterly maladroit re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark to the banker would hasten it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have better stayed at the hacienda</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made ready for whatever came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy was suddenly rooted to the pave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment in frightened surprise. Winifred</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brewer in an automobile was coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him -- stopping -- speaking low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voiced and hurriedly. It was not in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan. Something had happened!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get in," she said. "Where is Billy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At the legation. What-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get in," she bade him curtly. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no time to lose. They have been out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to the farm--two men. They will be going</seg><seg type="columnLine">back with other men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was in beside her. But instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeding away she drove slowly up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Calle Central and into the Calle Grande</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastward. They might have been riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">for pleasure to all seeming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We mustn't look as if we are disturbed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Talk, laugh--anything."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She smiled as she said it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are you going?" he smiled back</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To get Billy. We shall need him. Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we have luck, and don't have to wait!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Things that neither of them could after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward recall they chattered gaily about</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they turned into the Calle Commercio.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The luck for which Winifred had prayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was with them. Billy was coming out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door as they approached the legation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw them and paused, his mouth drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping open, his nose twitching spasmodically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't ask questions. Jump in. Look</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased," Jimmy enjoined on him as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went on easily up the street to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the Calle Cristina. It took them past</seg><seg type="columnLine">the German legation. It was a bit of bra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vado on Winifred's part. She could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">chosen another way; but she was curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see if there was any stir at the mission.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing, however, was apparent as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those chaps back there are sporting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaiser Hogitall's rag today just as if every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was hunky with them," advanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy from the haze of his bewilderment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could not think of anything else to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, and he was forbidden a question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His remark drew no reply. Winifred</seg><seg type="columnLine">was turning into the cross street. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed the accelerator, and the car re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponded with quickened life. Soon they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on the Santa Marta Road. Winifred</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the throttle degree by degree until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were roaring south at forty miles an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour. The girl's hands were steady on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel. She "felt" the road like a veteran</seg><seg type="columnLine">pacemaker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now tell us!" exploded Jimmy.

"They</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in a car." She glanced at her wrist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch. "It was an hour ago. Father met</seg><seg type="columnLine">them at the door. Sam was with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were in a furious mood--the Germans</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and demanded the instant production of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the minister. They knew, they said, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was there. Father--oh, he was fine--</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretended astonishment, indignation. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave them no satisfaction. They attempt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to force an entrance, and father drew his</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver. He said he would shoot the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first man who came a step farther--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they knew he would do it! Sam stood with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his white teeth bared, grinning at them like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wolf, and with one of those big pistols in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It stopped them. Then one of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">started running around the house, and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hap took the east side. He cried out</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herr Kaufman's name, kept crying it at</seg><seg type="columnLine">every step, with words we could not under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand--German. We heard Herr Kaufman</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer from his window--'Herr Landeker;'</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was more German. But Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">put an end to it.

Billy asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With father," she said simply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Of course," said Jimmy as simply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She glanced at him, and away again at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribbon of road before them. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating it up.

His eminency hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown up yet, and if Whittaker knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything he wouldn't spill it. He was sore</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me for playing sick instead of telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that I'd resigned. I had a frightful</seg><seg type="columnLine">time screwing five dollars out of him on an</seg><seg type="columnLine">I. O. U. He's so darned tight he'll pop and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow away one of these days."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Winifred laughed. It did Jimmy good</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear her. She was disturbed but not dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mayed by the event of the morning. Brew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er was right. She was not afraid. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not that kind. He told her of Enrique's</seg><seg type="columnLine">raid on the secret wireless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, that was splendid!" she acclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Single-handed against three.

"There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nasty weather making over yonder. Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">as coal.

It had drowsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">there weeks without end, except for a semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional sally into the farther waters for</seg><seg type="columnLine">frugal gun-practise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Admiral Miguel Terrozas was ashore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He spent, indeed, most of his tim^tshore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having nothing to do when afloat but listen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his rusty anchor-chain grinding in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">hawse-hole. Ashore there were matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk about, matters that of late had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered to him in secret corners by cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain persons, and to which he had lent an</seg><seg type="columnLine">attentive ear; for he perceived advantage to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his personal renown and fortune in these</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidences.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But on this afternoon Admiral Terrozas</seg><seg type="columnLine">was receiving light in his darkened under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing, and the source of it, and the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner of it, whelmed him in astonishment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a waxing fear. He was seated in the port-</seg><seg type="columnLine">warden's office overlooking the harbor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His companion was a woman--a dark, lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle woman in gray, with a quiet voice and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet way that somehow conveyed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect of a vast authority speaking through</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Admiral Terrozas was made to see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his personal fortunes lay on the upper side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the shelf instead of being suspended by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair from the lower side. He was made to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that a long and powerful arm was ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stretch down from afar to Zanhoria and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knock mutinous heads together until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isthmus should resound with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was made to see the vision of an event-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ual United States of Central America found-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed not in strife but in the concord of mutual</seg><seg type="columnLine">interests and aspirations and, incidentally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a defensive navy that a brilliant sailor</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have profit and pleasure in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manding. And, finally, Admiral Terrozas</seg><seg type="columnLine">was made to see that to go out and intercept</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peralta on his approach to the coast would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a very excellent way to avoid the adobe</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall that waited in Cortina for the enemies</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the republic.	•</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In fine, Admiral Terrozas had been made</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see in sharp relief which side his political</seg><seg type="columnLine">bread was buttered on. When he left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">port-warden's office he went immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard his ship, and in half an hour was</seg><seg type="columnLine">steaming for the open sea. The Sea Bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably would lay a devious course for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Puerto Mono, out of the regular lane of</seg><seg type="columnLine">traffic; also, she might put in at a point</seg><seg type="columnLine">above or below the port.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The admiral would patrol the coast in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope that good fortune would place the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yacht in his way, whether on this day, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morrow, or the day after. And as</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance, or Providence, would have it he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">laid his course south by east at first when</seg><seg type="columnLine">with equal reason he might have laid it</seg><seg type="columnLine">north by west.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Isaacs, meanwhile, after watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">El Terror clear the harbor, entertained her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self at dinner in a retired cafe by the water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">front, and prolonged the meal to the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treme limit of gentility, for she had a wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">of three hours to endure before her return</seg><seg type="columnLine">train left for the capital.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STEAMING up the coast as El</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terror steamed down it came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunboat Lincoln. She was off Pun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ta Gorda, and inshore in the territorial</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters of Zanhoria. Less than four hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay between her and Puerto Mono. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">would drop anchor at ten if all went well.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One bell in the second dog-watch had struck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sea was bland as a moorland pond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Submarine on the starboard beam, sir.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just emerging. Distance about four thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand yards," called the lookout.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunboat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Lincoln was agasp with astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. A submarine in these waters! Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less--it might be--an American boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A four-inch explosive shell screaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the Lincoln's rigging settled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question. It burst a hundred yards away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The general alarm and torpedo defense</seg><seg type="columnLine">bells rang out. Men jumped to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">stations. The range-finders sent in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">curt orders, and the forward guns spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The U worked in nearer, shelling as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, but without a hit. It was not afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this old slow-footed tub with guns no</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater than its own. It could run circles</seg><seg type="columnLine">around her. And this other old tub poking</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from the point--blundering in where</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had no business--would make off when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she saw what was up. Terrozas knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">where his interests lay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Great spouts of water rose about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lincoln from the falling shells, and around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the U. Each was getting the range, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was nip and tuck as to which would score</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first hit. If the Lincoln, it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over with the enemy; if the U, it depend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed on where the shot struck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then from the boiling sea about the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marine a white streak darted forth with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous velocity. It circled a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">to allow for the pitiful speed of the gunboat;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the submarine had not taken into</seg><seg type="columnLine">For The Flag</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">iii</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">account the gunboat's zigzag, and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">venomous zip the torpedo whizzed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty yards ahead of the mark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Lincoln's wireless was signaling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other gunboat. The quarter-deck had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made her out, but could not understand her</seg><seg type="columnLine">tactics. She had sheered off on a course</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would bring her well to the north of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the submarine. These were neutral waters;</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the Zanhorian going to make no pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">test?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Terrozas kept his silent course. The U</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it understood him--he was simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to quit the scene, and let his friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">finish their work unhindered. His action</seg><seg type="columnLine">could bear no other interpretation. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old fool was taking a stupid risk. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">might get a stray shot in his vitals from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shell from the U found the Lincoln at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last. It plumped into her engine-room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">killing two men, but did not explode. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed in the intermediate cylinder-head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, and the boat lay crippled on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. But her guns still spoke, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">submarine kept her distance. A shot had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grazed its conning-tower and carried a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">along with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then something happened, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a miracle--no less.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> El Terror was off the beam of the U now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The latter was preparing to launch a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">torpedo--with long odds in its favor this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time--when the Zanhorian gunboat let</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose its entire starboard battery of three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounders at the German. And it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit--that was the miracle of it--a hit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time by a gun-crew that scarccly</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the smell of powder! The submarine</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled over and went down, with only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating patch of stinking oil to mark where</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Terrozas left the few men yet alive</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling in the water, and wore around to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to the Lincoln's aid. He had proved that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew which side his bread was buttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">on; and, besides, dead Germans tell no tales.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UNVEILED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T^NRIQUE stayed at home on Friday,</seg><seg type="columnLine">' as he had promised, for the message</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was to come from Mary. He was up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at ten o'clock, and after a breakfast he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no relish for, and a listless half-hour with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the mor: ing paper, he dawdled about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house in miserable suspense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Don Luis Valera had gone away very</seg><seg type="columnLine">early, the old butler informed Enrique, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer to a note brought by a messenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">who would deliver it into no hands other</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the secretary's own. Enrique won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered a little what such an imperative sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mons foretold. Was the German legation</seg><seg type="columnLine">making trouble? Well, let Don Luis at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tend to it; he had done his part, and had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken head to show for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since the quarrel with his uncle Enrique</seg><seg type="columnLine">had exchanged with him only the perfunc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory civilities demanded in the presence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the servants. They had dined together the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night before in cold silence. Enrique had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not mentioned his purposed attack on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wireless. If he failed, it would only be</seg><seg type="columnLine">what Don Luis would have expected of him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if he succeeded Don Luis would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">small praise for him. He had called him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool--let him remain in that belief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy did not know that his uncle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">apprized by Ortega of the dangerous task</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had set for him, had lain awake listening</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his home-coming, nor could he know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that before leaving the house that morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don Luis had softly looked in on him as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept to reassure himself of his safety. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">moped about from room to room, counting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time and chewing the cud of bitter re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flection. His uncle--Jimmy--Ortega--were</seg><seg type="columnLine">all in league against Mary. They per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted in reading her falsely, in manufactur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a character for her that was as far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth as hell from heaven.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as he recurred to the incident in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Calle Dolores he was compelled to acknowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge that it looked equivocal. It was part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an event to which, as yet, he did not hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">the key. Mary had promised to supply it;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the day was wearing on, and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no word from her. And it was a thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded explanation. A woman could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hold silence in the face of the extraordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary situation in which she was found by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who loved her. She would hasten to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give a reason that should be at once sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">and satisfactory. Why did Mary delay?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Enrique's forehead gathered into heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">furrows. He had told Mary that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not ask an explanation. Would she rest on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this? But no, of her own accord she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said she would send for him. He was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay at home until he heard. Well, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">staying, and he did not hear. Why? It</seg><seg type="columnLine">112</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was two o'clock. Surely she must*mow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony of his waiting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tried in a dozen ways to ease the pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age of the hours, to create for himself an</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere of unconcern, of assured confi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence in his ultimate deliverance from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspense in which he was prisoned. All his</seg><seg type="columnLine">devices failed--nothing mattered but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">primal passion that was devouring him. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">last he could endure the ache of it no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer. It was striking three. Six hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had waited in a torture of expectancy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would put an end to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went to the telephone in the library,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and called up Morales' house. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">an eternity in answering, but at length a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman's palpitant voice came to him on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire.

He took in the young man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">neglige attire, and his drawn face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have not been out today?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir," Enrique answered briefly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had left off his walk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You were hurt last night, Senor Ortega</seg><seg type="columnLine">tells me.

Before the boys' return</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Cortina he had hunted up some iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">braces to secure the pole to the coaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the skylight. The house was tiled, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coaming offered the only vantage-point</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his purpose. A ladder from the inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">would give safe access to it. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">were coming back now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will have to hurry, sir," Billy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying.

We might get a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">look up the Santa Marta road."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We might," agreed Brewer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stepped into his room and returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a binocular field-glass. The hall was</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-studded, and the ladder did not reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ceiling by three feet. It was an ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shaky affair. Diego steadied it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the top rung they were able to draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves up by the skylight casing on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof.

Jimmy went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a window and looked out. The storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy had prophesied was about to break.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gusts of scorching air blew in on him. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yard old Tia Matilde was hurriedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripping a clothes-line of certain household</seg><seg type="columnLine">linens she had washed in the early hours of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day. A blinding flash of lightning sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy staggering back from the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not fond of fireworks," he said with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a forced smile. "Not that kind. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming on top of that quake last night it</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes me skittish. Hadn't we better see</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the windows on the west?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. Close these in here, please. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will look after the others. Sam, go out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dose the shutters on this side."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Winifred sped away, and Sam hastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">off on his mission. Jimmy saw to the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows in the dining-room, and went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the hall. Tio Diego was steadying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ladder for Billy, who was scrambling</seg><seg type="columnLine">down without any nice regard to his foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. He was panicky, and confessed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That last flash! Gosh, I could feel it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my boots," he gulped. "You don't smell</seg><seg type="columnLine">any brimstone about me, do you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Father! Why doesn't he come down?</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is raining great sheets in the valley. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">will get it in another minute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Winifred. She had run out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last west room, and was anxiously ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioning Billy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He stopped to have another look with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass. You can see the road for miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">up there. We'd furled the flag--be whipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pieces if we hadn't--when that flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">came. I didn't wait to say good-by. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Brewer just stood there looking up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road like a boy watching for the circus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Say, Miss Winifred, your father is a cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand all right. The kind to have."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the crepuscular light bred by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">onrushing tempest Jimmy could not see</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the cross-fire of emotions pictured in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's face; but he could fancy how they</seg><seg type="columnLine">battled there--pride and pain, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">victory aloof from either. Could Brewer</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever give back that which he had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man was coming in from the roof,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the binocular swung from a strap about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck. He paused on the upper rounds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ladder to lower the wings of the sky-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, and barely in time. A flying wave of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water dashed in on him, and sprayed those</seg><seg type="columnLine">below. Brewer was drenched to the skin;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he finished his work. Then he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE storm swooped bellowing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rock-built house. The rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove by in solid walls, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness of night was in the hall. Diego</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed himself, and muttered what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could remember of his prayers. None of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them gave a thought to Kaufman in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">solitary confinement a few feet away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brewer shouted above the turmoil to Sam:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Light the lamp. Let us see what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are about here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Jimmy was already at the lamp, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently the enfolding gloom was relieved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winifred's hand lay upon her father's arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she was urging him to his room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must change your clothes," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, putting her mouth close to his ear to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make him hear. "You will take cold."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her solicitude, warm and pressing, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">new to him. His pale face flushed under</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and, with a sort of timidness that brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">a kindred flush to his daughter's cheek, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid his hand on hers and kept it there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He bent his head to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am all right," he told her. "It won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt me to wait, and I've something to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He unslung the glasses and dropped them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stood, all of them silently listening</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the uproar without. After a little the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first fury of it abated. It grew lighter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thunder rolled away into the distance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The wind fell. The rain came down no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer in bucketfuls but in measured lenity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In half an hour the sun would be smiling on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water-swept earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wanted to tell you," Brewer said when</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last he could make himself heard in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary tone, "that my glass discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">an open car coming from Cortina. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Germans!" ejaculated Jimmy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How far off was it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I should say about three miles. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">may not be the Germans, but we won't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught napping at any rate. We are ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They'll have a merry time getting over</seg><seg type="columnLine">here," derided Billy. "The ravine is a rag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing river by this. We are not getting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">full force of this rain; it started in the low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land. It will be hours before they can</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross, if they haven't turned back. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you say, Tio? This isn't the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've seen a cloudburst here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He addressed the old man in Spanish.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They talked at some length, and Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that Billy was frowning and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose twitching fitfully. He cut Tio Diego</seg><seg type="columnLine">off with a curt gesture and spoke to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brewer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He says there's a foot-bridge down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravine about a mile, where it turns south.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's rocky there, and high and narrow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's what piles the water up so when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it rains. The Indians built the bridge years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago, Diego says. It was pretty shaky the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last time he saw it, but you could get</seg><seg type="columnLine">across."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If they know about it," Jimmy inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected. "Perhaps they don't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think," said Brewer quietly, "we had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">better go on the supposition that they do</seg><seg type="columnLine">know about it. Anyway, they are likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to explore the ravine before giving up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In this rain?" objected Jimmy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy jeered at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rain? A German isn't afraid of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the outside of him; it's on the inside he</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicks at."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the car. What will they do with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Run it in the bushes off the road until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are ready to go back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brewer smiled in a set, stem way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps," he remarked, "they won't go</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. At least, not with Kaufman. Sam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">go around the house and close every shut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. We won't have time for it if they try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rush us. And we'd better have lunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">right away, Winny. I'll be with you in</seg><seg type="columnLine">five minutes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He drew his arm from the girl's hold on</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, very gently, and went into his room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My heavenly home!" exclaimed Billy</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the door shut. "If I was an insurance</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent I'd hate to have popper Kaufman</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a risk. Not if he started to cut up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Brewer about."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not laugh. He was in sober ear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nest. Jimmy's eyes sought Winifred's, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a faraway look in hers that did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not take him in. She murmured some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about seeing Tia Matilde, and slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">away down the hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TO BE CONCLUDED</seg><seg type="columnLine">ME AND "Muley" Bowles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Chuck" Warner are putting</seg><seg type="columnLine">a saddle on a colt in the Cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">J corral, when "Telescope" Tol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liver enters the precincts of said ranch, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we gets our first glimpse of Archibald Ames.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Archibald occupies a seat on the buck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board with Telescope, and they soon comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and climbs on top of the corral fence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Archibald's name fits him--in a way. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of his first name indicates his girth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his last name his height. He's one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them persons who you'd never invite to set</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, 'cause he don't seem to require no</seg><seg type="columnLine">such posture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It takes him quite a long time to nego-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiate the top-pole of the corral, and when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">does get up there he has to balance--his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet won't reach the next pole. He's wear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them dinky little pants, with the seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a shoplifter and the knees of Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fauntleroy.

He gestured violently and</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed his head upon his hand. The girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarded him inquisitively as if demanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether this were a new game. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprehending, began to swarm up a tree.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The professor was nonplussed; but as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared upward he observed what appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be giant nests amid the branches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, my God!" he groaned.

Exhausted and panting, he crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a shelter formed of branches interlaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">across horizontal boughs, and sprawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a corner sank instantly to sleep amid a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd of chattering women and children.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From a ridiculous dream in which he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a hospital being tickled by nurses he</seg><seg type="columnLine">became semiconscious. A real poke in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribs elicited an "Ow!" and brought him wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">awake to find that he was packed like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">codfish in a tin of sardines between moist</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs and bodies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A vivid realization of his environment--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the stench--impelled him to dash out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hut, only quelled by the recollection</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could not fly. Now and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the rhythmic breathing and the drip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the forest which sounded like eternal</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeping came the dismal hoot of an owl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The professor groaned, swallowed a mouth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful of fetid acrid heat, and lapsed into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumber of the exhausted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">6JKS8I THE strain of thirty-six hours' wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering in the jungle, although it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not killed scientific interest in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing discovery, had clouded the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor's mind until the elemental needs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">food and sleep had been satisfied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when he awoke to find himself alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the green light of dawn he realized fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gravity of his plight. These little</seg><seg type="columnLine">people were undoubtedly the wild pigmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the forest, seldom seen or even glimpsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by whites or negroes, a primitive shy folk</seg><seg type="columnLine">who even in bartering with their com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratively tame brethren of the forest</seg><seg type="columnLine">fringe, would only consent to leave skins</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a tree in the darkness and return the</seg><seg type="columnLine">following night to collect the sweet potatoes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">John O'Damn	133</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">or copper wire, or other produce left for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. They were nomads; neither culti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vating nor fighting; living mostly on edible</seg><seg type="columnLine">roots and game in the deepest recesses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Congo forests.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor's camp was two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from the nearest Belgian outpost;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was--he had no idea how far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his camp. What chance had he of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescued? As he stared despondently at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glow of sunrise leaf-patterned on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest roof he could hear them chattering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He listened, mechanically noting four</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinct clicks--a labial, kissing sound;</seg><seg type="columnLine">dental, as a monkey chatters; palatal, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a carter encourages his horse; and a lingual,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gurgling klop-klop of a water-bottle; so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he concluded that their language consisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">of combinations of these four clicks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Interesting," he mused; but how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil was he to communicate with them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ask aid, to offer a reward? He knew a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little Kiswahili, the lingua franca of middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Africa; but they, no word. As he jotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">down notes he became aware of a looseness</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the waist. His belt had gone! Hence</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ridiculous dream of nurses tickling!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The devils had the cartridges as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rifle! However, there was nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be done but to make the best of the situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion by studying the conditions. What a</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendid monograph he would be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">write--if ever he got free!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he continued to scribble the girl swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a bough into the communal nest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Squatting on her haunches she smiled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He smiled. She chattered, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretching out her hand, pulled at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good morning then," said he, "as evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently that's what you want, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed, a loud peal of delight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Imitative," continued the professor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Probably you've never laughed aloud in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your life until you heard me. Savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">never do. However, you seem to enjoy</seg><seg type="columnLine">it thoroughly. Satisfying a repressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinct. She gesticulated delightedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Splendid! Now for the first thing suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">we begin a lesson? Your imitative faculty</seg><seg type="columnLine">should help you some. Food! Food!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Food!" he repeated, pointing to liis open</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. "Get that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she chattered and pointed below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No; not yet. I want you to say it, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear. Listen--foo-d! Foo-d!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he leaned toward her mouthing the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">word, she goggled and perked her head on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side like an inquisitive sparrow. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had performed about twenty times she</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursed her lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fool!" she said, blowing it at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not bad!" said the professor. "Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">again--foo-ddd!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she persisted in counting it as a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">game, blowing at him and giggling. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor considered and pointed to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth and below. Immediately she swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the nest with the effortless ease of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">monkey. He clambered after her, watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a dozen- faces. Below were the ashes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a fire. The girl proffered him a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cold or tepid cassava.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, damn!" ejaculated the professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an image of breakfast food before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl laughed delightedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "H'm," said he, sticking a finger in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mess. "-of a joke, isn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While he ate--not much--he regarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd of men and women. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">found him a most absorbing object. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">women wore no ornaments of any kind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even the usual tribal cicatrices; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woolly hair was unkempt. On even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stoutest of them the ribs showed plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in contrast to the white girl who although</seg><seg type="columnLine">lean was well fleshed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Evidently, mused the professor, heredi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary powers of digestion and resistance--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps she gets the pickings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Overcome by a longing to know the exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">conformation of the skull, he advanced to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">young pigmy, judging from her breast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a squeak she fled. Instantly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white girl chattered angrily, provoking</seg><seg type="columnLine">much clucking among the tribe which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished by the girl seizing the child and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragging her up to the professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She protested volubly. He hesitated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearing to rouse their ire, but concluding</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the girl had the power of a chief and</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessing at their conception of his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentions, decided that it would be best to</seg><seg type="columnLine">disabuse their minds. So while the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the terrified child he ran expert</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers over the skull, estimating shrewdly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dimensions and formation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then just to show that there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">favoritism he turned his attention to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white girl. She stood as still as a rock as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fingers fumbled beneath her hair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gravely extracting his memo-book he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes. The little folk watched the magic</seg><seg type="columnLine">ritual in complete silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">134</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks very much," he said, bowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemnly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl laughed, seemingly eager for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slighest excuse to exercise her newly</seg><seg type="columnLine">found vocal accomplishments, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that save for the head man, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had grinned, no facial contortion re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembling mirth ever disturbed the pigmies'</seg><seg type="columnLine">features--tending to the conclusion that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of humor only developed in ratio to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intellectual development.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The compliance of the lady suggested that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might be able to enlist her aid in recov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering his rifle and cartridges. He patted</seg><seg type="columnLine">her arm to emphasize approval, and pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his waist and peered around. The girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him attentively, chattered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to make a hoarse screaming noise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Puzzled the professor again pantomimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the missing belt, which elicited once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bellowing as the girl pointed at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to the forest. The noise suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bad imitation of a cow lowing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But a cow--here!" murmured the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed delightedly, gestured at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolid folk still gazing and then walked awaj'</seg><seg type="columnLine">beckoning. Immediately the professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved, the whole tribe followed him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of one little man bearing a smoldering</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick and of women loaded with babes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">calabashes gave him an idea. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the march!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHERE were they going? Prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably deeper into the forest, making</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape more improbable than ever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the professor halted the tribe stopped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wake. The wizened little captor mate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rialized, pointing a pipe-stem arm. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards away the girl, waist deep in under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth, beckoned. The sun was merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">an incandescent glow through the roof of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest. The professor could not take</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bearings and had he been able to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was not sure in what direction he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandered from the camp. Perforce he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must obey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he plunged on the tribe melted away</seg><seg type="columnLine">except for the girl leading him. But they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were there; now and again he could catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glimpse of a tiny brown leg or arm, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, and hear the click-click of a conversa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in the dense green.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the professor the struggle was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">insupportable; but the little folk slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the jungle as snakes glide through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">grass. Occasionally the professor was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelled to rest, panting and exhausted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sometimes the harsh screams of a flock of</seg><seg type="columnLine">parrots broke the eternal dripping of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest and the perpetual rustle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">myriad life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And they stuck to the "cursed" forest;</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest all the time. Once when an open</seg><seg type="columnLine">glade was sighted through the cavernous</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom the professor jibbed and pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnestly to the blinding spread of sunlight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the girl chattered and beckoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight ahead; and a dozen thin arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">protruded through the green walls. Always</seg><seg type="columnLine">was he conscious of those eyes watching,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever driving him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sometimes the girl would squat on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">limb of a tree and watch him patiently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the exasperated professor cursed</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud she would laugh delightedly--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the professor swore anew! Twice when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he failed to curse she approached and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled his beard and "he! he'd!" with</seg><seg type="columnLine">delight at the torrent of oaths with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the professor reacted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they were traversing a piece of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratively dry going she suddenly leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clear six feet to the right. He stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl chattered at him excitedly. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">first the professor could see nothing; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mass of brilliant green leaves and dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows moved. He saw the coils of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake. The professor moved quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The farther he went the more anxious</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew the professor. They might be off</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a week's march for all he knew. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't do it; no white man could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last at 10:25 by his repeater the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor mutinied. He sank down on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">root and refused to budge. He made</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs of sleep. The whole tribe, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragments of it visible, discussed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation energetically. But the professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't care. He slept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he awakened from a short doze he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the girl squatting a few feet from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as motionless as a sphinx. No sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the little folk could he see; but he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned enough to know that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not far off. Immediately she saw that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was awake she approached and pulled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The professor had thought this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">funny at first, but now he was tired and</seg><seg type="columnLine">irritable. He scowled and spoke no word.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She seemed surprised, and she made a move</seg><seg type="columnLine">to repeat the action; but the professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">John O'Damn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">135</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">snarled fiercely, showing his teeth like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-muzzled Irish terrier. She appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to understand the menace and desisted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then after a pause she pointed to her head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The professor stared. She reached and</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking his hand put it in her hair. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he left it there, puzzled to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what she could mean. He laughed. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to have her bumps read again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The tickling sensation was pleasing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He scratched her head. She whined.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As soon as he ceased she chattered at him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he shook his head. Smiling she</seg><seg type="columnLine">plucked his beard. This time the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor felt better-tempered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, my dear," said he, "you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the reaction this time as it's up to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make you my friend if ever I'm to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of this--and if you like I'll take you too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Would you like to?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed in delight and danced about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're a base flatterer, you know!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued humoring her. "I never guessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had such a charming voice before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As' a matter of fact, it's the music of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own kind that pleases you. I wonder who</seg><seg type="columnLine">the devil your people were? How old are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you? Not more than fifteen I should think</seg><seg type="columnLine">by your development--allowing for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropics."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She glided close to him and put down her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'm -!" said he. "I know</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs love to have their ears scratched, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">never a human! D'you know you'd be</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather a beauty if you had a wash and got</seg><seg type="columnLine">dolled up a bit. What I can't get is how</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth you've gotten your color? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly have the most extraordinary pig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentation. Say now, wouldn't you like</seg><seg type="columnLine">better to come with me and get the benefits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of civilization? Eh? If I can get out of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">I guess I can get you with me, and it isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing to let a white stay with these</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends of yours. What do you think?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stopped scratching and held her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you think?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She smiled delightedly and put her head</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to be scratched again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no! Look here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He held up her head and pointed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, to her and the vague distance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She stared, puzzled for a moment; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then arose, evidently prepared to resume</seg><seg type="columnLine">the journey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no!" exclaimed the professor vigor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ously.

They chattered and clucked,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but to no purpose; the professor had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mutinied. For some reason that he could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not fathom they finally elected to camp</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the ground, swiftly making shelters of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">boughs and grass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Desperately he kept on with the lessons</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in English. Whether from a natural or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hereditary aptitude she picked up words</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with surprising celerity. Many she got</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">muddled; misconnecting the sounds with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the objects. Try as he would he could not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dissociate the name John with "Oh damn"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so that she continued to touch him on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">136</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chest with much delight saying, "John 0</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Damn," followed by a peal of laughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All through the heat of the day grimly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the professor played the wonderful new</seg><seg type="columnLine">game. Besides the interest in teaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and getting a little inside this strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">anomaly of a mind, there lay the principal</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One morning in the midst of a lesson she</seg><seg type="columnLine">put her hands on his chest and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick at the fastening of his shirt. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor almost blushed! He held her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, wondering what on earth she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">after. She chattered at him expostu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">latingly, saying:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good! Good! John oh damn!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then she pointed to her own breast, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chest and at the little people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a while he could not imagine what</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could mean. Finally out of curiosity</seg><seg type="columnLine">he unbuttoned the shirt and dropped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands to see what she would do. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quaint gesture like a monkey opening a bag</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nuts she pulled the shirt apart. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposure of his bare chest startled a litter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of clicks. A finger touching his flesh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own acquainted him that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased to observe that they were both of</seg><seg type="columnLine">approximately the same color.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the end of a week she had gotten the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of fully a score of words into her head;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with such a vocabulary much may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done. They were all words of simple and</seg><seg type="columnLine">concrete objects; verbs were limited to</seg><seg type="columnLine">"go," "come," "stop," "sleep." Each at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt to invite her to escape with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">was doubtful; for the most he could attain</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to suggest more than one white man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vague distance, and that she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">go with him. She had assented eagerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing, but whether she had understood or</seg><seg type="columnLine">not he could not determine, only could he'</seg><seg type="columnLine">await an opportunity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Evidently the savages had thoroughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">established the identity of race or godhood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whichever it was, between the two, for now</seg><seg type="columnLine">a separate shelter was erected for each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and his primitive behests were</seg><seg type="columnLine">obeyed without question except--the return</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his rifle and cartridges. For even gods</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not to be trusted in their estimation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On one day the tribe did not make any</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to persuade him to march and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were very excited. The girl in explanation</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the cow-like noise again, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained later by the bellowing of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come! Come!" said the professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come!" echoed the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She led him through the jungle to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamp where an elephant, hamstrung by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little people, lay wallowing and trum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peting in death agony with half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny arrows in the soft of the joints.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor demanded his rifle. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl replied that the beast would</seg><seg type="columnLine">"sleep." When the elephant did "sleep"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little folk were soon crawling over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the vast carcass like ants over a chunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">of meat. They camped immediately and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forthwith gorged themselves to repletion--</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sleep, to wake, to eat again. The pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor was in despair; yet he was weak and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin and the meat food was strengthening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He noticed that the girl ate moderately--</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinctively apparently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the fourth day, amid much chatter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they began to move. Although the greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the carcass remained they made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to carry any away with them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps knowing no method, as did more</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilized tribes, of preserving meat; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did remove the tusks. This made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the professor think hard. He decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hope of escape lay in the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that as ivory is of value all over Africa</seg><seg type="columnLine">that even these peoples would desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize something upon it and would con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequently approach nearer to a more civil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized tribe to barter for wire or implements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the dank cavern of the jungle all ways</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the same to the professor, so that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not surmise whether they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed their direction or not. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in desperate hope he no longer tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">delay progress, but marched as long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as hard as he could. On the third day they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to an open glade about a mile across</seg><seg type="columnLine">and halted. A terrific discussion broke out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evidently like apes they feared to leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, for they waited on the fringe until</seg><seg type="columnLine">scouts had returned from the long grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the tops of high trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came another commotion. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl refused to enter the open, chattered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">violently gestured. The professor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled at her fear until she pointed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing sun and at her body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ot!" she said persistently. "Ot! Ot!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">using her English vocabulary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the professor understood why she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had retained her color, acquiring the greeny</seg><seg type="columnLine">pallor in the stewing atmosphere of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle. But this refusal to leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">John O'Damn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">137</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter might mean a serious bar to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape, he reflected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good--good!" said he, patting her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And taking off his coat he put it upon her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She made no resistance. By her smiles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and "oh, damns" she seemed to consider</seg><seg type="columnLine">it a great joke and without further ado</seg><seg type="columnLine">capered on ahead into the sunshine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Evidently she decided that the coat was</seg><seg type="columnLine">"good medicine," for on entering the forest</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other side she made no attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to return it. The professor acquiesced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying, "Good! good!" and she laughed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crying, "Oh, damn! John oh damn!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">delightedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the glimpse of the sun had informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the professor that they were going north--</seg><seg type="columnLine">which meant toward the Boma Masindi</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail from Uganda.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT evening there was much</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement in the tribe which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor mistakenly translated as</seg><seg type="columnLine">being near to an alien people. They camped</seg><seg type="columnLine">high in a tree, which indicated that some</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger was apprehended. For the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time since he had lost it the professor saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rifle--being dragged into a nest on an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite bough. He drew the girl's atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, energetically making the most of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">vocabulary. To his surprise she assented,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come--John oh damn!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She chattered across the tree which</seg><seg type="columnLine">resulted in two pigmies bringing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eagerly he opened the breech--to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">that somehow they had contrived to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ejector, for the cartridge had gone;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and upon examination he discovered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrel to be full of slime. He managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to clear it after a fashion, but the rifling</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rusted from breech to muzzle. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, the professor attempted to conjure</seg><seg type="columnLine">some cartridges. Cursing, the professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the hour of the monkey he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakened by the girl. He sat up abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her "no good--oh damns." The moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was full and high. Around in the tree the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little folk were clicking away as softly as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spring shower upon a roof. Then his ear</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught a peculiar sound--a distinct drum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming as of native tom-toms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A village must be near, he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">joyfully. But the girl kept whispering:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No good, oh damn! No good, oh</seg><seg type="columnLine">damn!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She pushed a cartridge into his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she tugged at his shirt sleeve. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled to the edge of the nest platform</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticing that her eyes registered extreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror as she pointed downward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A glimpse in a patch of spattered moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light made him catch his breath--a gorilla</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-erect was pounding its hands on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous hairy chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the brute vanished into the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows another appeared moving side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways like a gigantic crab--and another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the professor comprehended why</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had restored the rifle. Evidently not</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding how to use it they desired</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to defend them. But one cartridgel</seg><seg type="columnLine">He held up the cartridge, saying, "No</seg><seg type="columnLine">good--five!" and lifted both hands, for as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had learned the little folk could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">count to four, five: two hands upraised</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveyed plurality generally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl brought him two more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, damn!" he whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, damn!" she murmured encour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hastily he attempted to ram home a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cartridge; but try as he would to manipu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">late the ejector the cartridge would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter the rusted breech. He scraped at it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the gloom with a penknife. The car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tridge jammed half-way and would neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">go in nor come out. He peered below again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gorillas were still around the tree.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were cornered. There was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do but wait and trust that the brutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be moved to attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the girl lay beside him along the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">bough she pointed down and at herself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispering:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me! Me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor pondered and imagined</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she meant that these brutes were her</seg><seg type="columnLine">parents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No good," he murmured, "your biology's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all wrong, my dear!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, yes," she insisted, pointing at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great apes below, at the pigmies and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her breasts, muttering persistently:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Me! Me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor grasped the fact tl iut she</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that she had been stolen from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">people by gorillas as the orang-outang</seg><seg type="columnLine">steal native children in Borneo; and prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably, he surmised, rescued by the little folk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rhythmic thrum of the beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">138</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to the rustle and squelch of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">undergrowth. The green pallor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlight above was warming to the glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dawn. Save for an occasional click as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft as rain-patter the pigmies were</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peering as far over the branch as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dared the professor strained to see more</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this strange rite of the great apes. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they passed in the spattered patch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlight could he catch a glimpse of each</seg><seg type="columnLine">performer whose terrible teeth were bared</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a snarl of ecstasy, the hairy paws pound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing rhythmically upon the mighty chests.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As far as the processor could determine</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were moving, shuffling sideways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the most primitive dance in the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'round and 'round the tree as if it were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">maypole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just as he was wondering whether the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts were given to this social amusement</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the mood took them or whether, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all savage tribes, the moon was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instigator, there came a squawk, the crack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a branch breaking and the rustling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves in the passage of a heavy body</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling to the accompaniment of a terrified--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Eh! Eh! Eh!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly the rhythm of the great apes</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased. There was a momentary silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then one of them seemed to bark a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand, answered by grunts of rage from all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides. A hail of chatter broke out among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pigmies; the girl dragged at the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor's shirt, hissing:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No good! Oh damn! No good--oh</seg><seg type="columnLine">damn!" mixed with excited monosyllables.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard the phtt of arrows and much</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustling of undergrowth from which arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage grunts. Then immediately beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">him appeared a dim face with small, vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, black holes of nostrils and a cavern</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a mouth set with wolf's teeth. Clicking</seg><seg type="columnLine">violently the girl tugged at his shirt anew;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the professor, realizing that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not compete with a gorilla in speed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of a tree, clutched the bough with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs as -he swung the useless rifle by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muzzle at a hairy squat body propelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward with the ease and swiftness of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rifle-butt crashed on the shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles beside the conical head and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift as the riposte of a skilled duellist</seg><seg type="columnLine">a paw shot out, plucked the weapon from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the professor's grasp, and holding by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehensile feet, the great beast buckled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the rifle in half as easily as a child would</seg><seg type="columnLine">bend a reed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A clutch at the professor's boot toe</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastened his movements. As he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw the slim leg of the girl disappear into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foliage above him; but as he stood up on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bough in a desperate attempt to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, his boots slipped. He grabbed at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small branch which tore away in his hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was conscious of the gorilla yawning be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath him and clutching wildly--fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN he grew conscious again</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was aware of some one tugging</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his arms. He began to kick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle, imagining that he was in the hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gorilla. Then a familiar "Oh damn!</seg><seg type="columnLine">No good! Oh damn!" reassured him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was lying half-submerged in a morass</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the great tree from which the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">was trying to drag him. The sun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">incandescent through the patterned roof.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He lumbered heavily out of the slough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered in green slime from head to foot--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but slime which had broken his fall and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved his bones. Around him was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentle rustle and drip of the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good!" said he, sitting on a root, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">what's happened?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He peered about. Near at hand was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elephant tusk sticking upright in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamp; but there was no sign of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pigmies nor the apes. He sighed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiped some more slime out of his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bending forward she pulled his green beard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and laughed delightedly as he smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good for you," he commented, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">where are your friends?

But as he turned one way</seg><seg type="columnLine">she went off on the pigmy trail again. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor stopped and considered. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation seemed more hopeless than ever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apparently she did not understand; or if</seg><seg type="columnLine">she did, did not wish to assist him to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">her tribe. Natural, after all, he reflected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He thought of exploring on his own,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving her to follow or not as she wished;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but--in what direction was he to go?</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he could find an open glade he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to work out some idea of direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl had halted, watching, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for him to follow when--the report</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a rifle startled him. He listened in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tently, fearful that his ears or his imagina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion had misled him, for a rifle meant either</seg><seg type="columnLine">a white man or at least a semi-civilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">native. Again came a report close at hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a wave of the hand and a shouted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come on!" the professor plunged forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipping and scrambling toward the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite regardless mirabile diclu of whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl was following or not, crazy at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">call of environment which that shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">symbolized.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fifty yards beyond he was wading in</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamp to his waist toward the silver of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight upon open water. Just as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated again another shot rang out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">directing the professor's attention to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe beyond the trees in which, like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam of the sun upon a house window,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a white helmet, sending him floundering</seg><seg type="columnLine">on regardless of crocodiles or any beast or</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady, yelling hoarsely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The uncouth noises had attracted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupants of the canoe. The paddlers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped. The blessed figure in the helmet</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned 'round to stare. The canoe began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to approach the shadows of the over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging forest. The professor ceased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">yell; climbed into the handiest tree and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited. Not until the canoe was within</seg><seg type="columnLine">hailing distance did the professor think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the girl. He peered around. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to him, but high up in a tree staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">open-mouthed at the strange vision of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe. The professor laughed with relief</seg><seg type="columnLine">and waved a hand to her, crying:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good! Good! Come! Come!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she did not seem to hear him. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared--stared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Qui est Id?" came a voice from the bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, God, me!" yelled the professor in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tremendous relief and recovering his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of reality added--"Amcricain1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Norn dc DieuI" echoed the voice over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">still water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The canoe shot forward more swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the branches into the swamp grass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A small, black-bearded man in the helmet</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed curiously at the gaunt figure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-headed giant with a green beard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slimed clothes. As the paddlers poled</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way the two white men exchanged</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanations. The little man was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Italian in the Belgian Congo service upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shooting-trip upon the Semliki River.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had heard by runner of the loss of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">American professor very distinguished, etc.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bade him welcome and congratulations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," said the professor as the canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">was forced through the grass beneath him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I demand a thousand pardons, but I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">here--what would you call him--an extra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary phenomenon--a lady white who</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been brought up among these--your</seg><seg type="columnLine">pigmies--very charming--and whom I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish to bring with me.

His friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jamieson, an experienced aviator,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was called for examination with the least</seg><seg type="columnLine">delay possible, and the next news that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of him was that he had been ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to a second lieutenancy in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Army Signal Corps. Jimmy himself, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a period of waiting during which exhaustive</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquiries were made into his mental and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moral fitness for that most exacting service,</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally received notice one day to present</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself at headquarters forthwith for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prescribed physical examination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As his friend had warned him, it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorcher. Five hours of exhaustive search</seg><seg type="columnLine">by skilled scientists for the least possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">traces of unsuspected defects which might</seg><seg type="columnLine">some day result in disaster. As Jimmie had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, however, he passed everything else</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a whoop. Five-feet ten of hard, wiry</seg><seg type="columnLine">athlete, there was no reason why not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Came then finally those delicate ear tests,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cold, merciless probing of scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery for a possible clogging of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lymph flow in the semi-circular canals of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inner ear which act as the spirit-levels</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the body. Jimmy was the least bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous; but confident withal. His un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounded confidence of youth had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken down--yet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hearing, of course, was perfect. Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no fear on that score; he could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whisper at twenty feet without diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culty, and he knew all the tricks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">examiners about pretending to hold a watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere behind his head. But that</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly revolving chair, that inexorable con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trivance which had blasted the hopes of so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many aspirants to the great game. . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmie took his seat with a half-smile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">alert readiness. A sergeant grasped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lever and spun him rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Enough!" called the examining surgeon</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, and looked into Jimmie's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a watch in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy knew that his eyes ought to roll</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly for about five seconds.

Again now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time the whirl was a longer one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right! Stop! Now, what do you see?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Point to it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What Jimmy saw in front of him hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to be the bald high forehead of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">eminent scientist.

Without hesitation he did so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hm, remarkably quick reaction," mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the surgeon, arid made a favorable</seg><seg type="columnLine">note to that effect. A short respite fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed, and then Jimmie was told to sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward with his head bent over his knees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The chair was then spun in sharp jerks once</seg><seg type="columnLine">to every two seconds for about twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolutions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now straighten up!" ordered the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geon sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmie straightened up, and instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaved himself over, tugging at one arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the chair as though to right a falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeroplane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hm, you'll do," the examiner smiled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's all, you can dress now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmie grinned covertly to himself and fled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, dead right was Jimmie Bellew.

He had the natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">gifts of quickness of thought and presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mind which go to make a good flyer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and presently he was promoted to "single</seg><seg type="columnLine">hops"; he was allowed to take a machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">up alone. He experienced the thrill of</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlling immense power at immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">heights, the wild exhilaration of speed. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the call of the bom bird-man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Good days. But there was a tiny spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the clear sky of Jimmie's contentment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little gray spot like a mote before the eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">which can be winked away but which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently there again a little blacker than</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. And Jimmie in his ebullient youth</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to realize that perhaps the man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience might know something after all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sense of Balance	143</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Nerves, Jamieson had spoken of, the haunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing knowledge of defect. Jimmie could</seg><seg type="columnLine">whoop along at a hundred miles an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">and could make a sixty-degree bank; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">how much of that was pure muscular</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of balance, he found himself wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; and how much did he have to rely</seg><seg type="columnLine">on that swaying air bubble in the red arc</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the inclinometer attached to the dash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board in front of his control wheel?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was a mechanical spirit-level, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it turned his thoughts inward to his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit-levels inside his head. Bud Blakely</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never have been able to carry out</seg><seg type="columnLine">a night raid when he could see nothing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had said. To what extent, then, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that defective ear of his affecting him; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">how much of his flying did he owe to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyesight?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A troublesome little speck, that, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept recurring with disquieting suddenness</seg><seg type="columnLine">apropos of nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmie thought he would try one day</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find out how long he could fly with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes shut. That surely would prove some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. He climbed to a good three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand level to allow plenty of room for</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovery in case of accidents, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his lean jaw clenched in determination</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his hawk brows drawn down in a fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">frown he pinched his eyes shut hard. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat tense while the machine hurtled along</seg><seg type="columnLine">for nearly two minutes. The tight lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to spread in a smile; it was easy, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a side puff struck him, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine heeled over to the left. Instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he whirled the wheel over in the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction and instinctively he opened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. Immediately the great planes rocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to the right; he had badly over-con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolled in his anxiety. In a second he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">righted the machine again; but his heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in his mouth. When a man is three</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet up in the air it takes very</seg><seg type="columnLine">little to make him taste his whole internal</seg><seg type="columnLine">system.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a few minutes the hammering of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pulse calmed down and he tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">analyze the thing. He had felt the tilt</seg><seg type="columnLine">while his eyes were shut; that was all right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But was his over-control due only to over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiousness--or had he gaged the angle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of deflection all wrong? And would he</seg><seg type="columnLine">have righted the machine with his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">still shut? He thought yes. But then</seg><seg type="columnLine">again--maybe not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That little speck was growing apace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Later, reviewing the matter in the less</seg><seg type="columnLine">strenuous environments of terra firma,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmie tried to persuade himself that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was quite all right; not once or twice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but many times he told himself so. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing lived with him. He spent quite a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his spare time telling himself that nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been wrong--but he hated to try the</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That kind of thing is bad for the nerves</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men who are supposed not to have any</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves. But it is surprisingly good for</seg><seg type="columnLine">cankerous specks. Under the stimulus of</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppression the dark growth throve amaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly and began to assume a horrifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape. Jimmie was something of a mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">analyst. He knew what was happening</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him; those three desultory years of</seg><seg type="columnLine">college had not been entirely wasted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That spook has got to be laid," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmie firmly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hit upon a solution. On his next</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruction flight, he said to himself, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would try the experiment again; under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlling hand of his teacher it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe. The next time accordingly he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">try. He shut his eyes tight and waited for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the feel of whatever he might feel. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while there was nothing to do, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">came one of the usual little dips which</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed correction. Jimmie's analysis of</seg><seg type="columnLine">self had not gone quite deep enough; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still over-anxious and he made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same old mistake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt the instructor in the rear seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his greater leverage take the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly out of his hands and right the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine. For a star pupil this was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgrace; Jimmie felt very much ashamed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But that vital question simply had to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled. Presently he experimented again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This time the corrective force was applied</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a jerk of impatience. Jimmie burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over; but he set his teeth and deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined to see the tiling through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whatever might have been his con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusions about himself, there was no mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking the instructor's attitude after that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With angry bruskness he took the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely away from his pupil, made a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank, and came down without further ado</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to the flying-field. That lesson was</seg><seg type="columnLine">over--and Jimmie had learned nothingl</seg><seg type="columnLine">As soon as they had climbed out:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the deuce was the matter with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?" snapped Jamieson crossly. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">144</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were flying like a ---- fool beginner. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have enough to do teaching the elementary</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff to that kind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seemed to be unreasonably irritable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It reminded Jimmie uneasily of the old days</seg><seg type="columnLine">when his friend had looked a little too freely</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the tall yellow tumbler. And Jamieson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was unnecessarily flushed too. Jimmie</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He would have liked to tell his friend all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his experiment, to have made a full</seg><seg type="columnLine">confession of his trouble and asked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">advice; but the opportunity was not ripe</seg><seg type="columnLine">just then, he reflected; he would wait for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">more favorable one. But somehow that</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity kept postponing itself with</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart-breaking indefiniteness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lieutenant Jamieson, in common with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other instructors, was frantically busy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for one thing, with the pressing need of</seg><seg type="columnLine">training as many men in one day as used</seg><seg type="columnLine">formerly to be handled in a month; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for another, his irritation seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled on him permanently now. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmie in desperation sought his friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his quarters in the hotel one evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made bold to mention the matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jamieson laughed self-consciously and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flushed and explained:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's an awful strain on one's vitality, old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, to take up fifteen or twenty boobs</seg><seg type="columnLine">every day. But let's not talk shop now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Which explained nothing. Or rather,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not enough. Jimmie wondered some more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meanwhile the days sped on, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmie's unlaid ghost walked at his heels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But his confidence was still unshaken; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt sure that his mistakes had been due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing more than over-anxiety; all he</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed was to prove it to himself. Till</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly there came the first big jolt</seg><seg type="columnLine">which shook him into a realization that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with experience not only might know</seg><seg type="columnLine">something, but that he is usually right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two of the huge new Sperry search-lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">were installed in the flying-field, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumored that the more advanced pupils</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to be given practise in night flying.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then only did Jimmie know that Jamieson</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spoken deadly truth on that first day</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his den. His little subterfuge had be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come a curse and had come home to roost.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the knowledge hanging over him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the little physical defect which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked so inconsequential at that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained still untested, his confidence, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pinch, had broken down!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmie had run away and hidden himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his room to think over this new menace</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the full force of it struck him with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">its pitiless clearness. The speck had sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly grown to maturity and taken a</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite and horrible form. It had a shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a name. It was Fear!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Second-Lieutenant James Bellew of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Army Signal Corps was afraid!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thing was unspeakable, infamous;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmie fought it desperately; for long</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible hours he tried to convince himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was only a passing hysteria born</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cumulative brooding. But the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood out before him, solid in its merciless</seg><seg type="columnLine">accusation. There was no dodging it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmie was afraid to take up a machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dark! He flung his arms out over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table and hid his face with shame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A WEEK passed and Jimmie fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his fear, and with the greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of having somebody discover</seg><seg type="columnLine">lis fear. A dozen times he made up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind to test himself out once and for all;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a dozen times he went up and did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare to try the fearsome experiment. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing had got a hold of him. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">confess everything to Jamieson, he deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined, and then with his co-operation he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would decide the matter definitely on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">next instruction flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But no instruction flights were forth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming for Jimmie. Jamieson was too busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the less advanced pupils and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimental work on the night tests.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he was so confoundedly morose these</seg><seg type="columnLine">days. No time could be wasted on a flier</seg><seg type="columnLine">who shaped so well as Jimmie did--by day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then lists were posted with the names</seg><seg type="columnLine">of officers who had been selected on account</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their good showing for promotion to</seg><seg type="columnLine">night practise. Jimmie's was well up near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top. 'He began to go about with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunted look and to evolve desperate plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">to postpone his turn until he should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out about himself. He felt half</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclined to go to Captain Wilson in charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the flying-school, complain of ear</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble, and get himself reexamined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That would be easy and plausible, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would then be automatically relieved</seg><seg type="columnLine">from flying-duty without anybody having</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out his shameful secret. But here</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in a curious anomaly. Jimmie wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a flyer; the great game called to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">irresistibly; and he had, besides, the pride</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sense of Balance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">145</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that went with his lean-jawed type of face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surely was Jimmie caught between two</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires of his own making.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He haunted the night practises, praying</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately for some unexpected oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity to go up as a passenger. Many</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers went up; but Jimmie's luck</seg><seg type="columnLine">was running strong on the ebb now. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how it never so fell out that he was called;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and junior officers are not encouraged to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be importunate when there are a host of</seg><seg type="columnLine">seniors who are anxious to experience a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then one night when the immense search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights were stabbing through low-scudding</seg><seg type="columnLine">layers of cumulus clouds and flooding rain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow billows on to the next layer a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet above, Jimmie found himself standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">near Captain Wilson. The flying-school</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief turned to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How about making a short jump for us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mister Bellew? We want to see if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can pick a machine out from behind those</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud patches. Imagine we're being raided;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conditions are ideal for a practise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmie's heart almost stopped beating.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thing was upon him with appalling</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, er--yes, sir," he managed to say.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Certainly. Er--can I take up Twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">four?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twenty-four was his favorite machine--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Twenty-four's engine was out of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission! Jimmy calculated that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to get away on the excuse and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently, tired of waiting, they would send</seg><seg type="columnLine">up somebody else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," said Captain Wilson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmie hurried off, elate; and then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain's voice calling after him chilled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the marrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, wait a minute. I believe Twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">four is on the sick-list. You'll have to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the others."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir," Jimmie mumbled. "Just got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get my helmet." And he fled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it happened, they did get tired of</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting. They would have had to wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the patience of any man, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmie was hiding in his room. Other fliers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a-plenty. Somebody else went up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmie had got away with it--this time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that sort of dodging could not go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on indefinitely. Jimmie was one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young officers posted for night practise, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as such it was his duty to be present on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field during these experiments. Other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">10</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">occasions arose, and Jimmie's frantic ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuses began to draw wondering attention.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In that hazardous game there were always</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen observers ready to pick up the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs of wavering on the part of the less</seg><seg type="columnLine">experienced students. People began to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">sideways after Jimmie and whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmie's hawk eyes snapped up these</seg><seg type="columnLine">covert glances in a second, and he burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">all 'round to the back of his neck as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed. Again the temptation came strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him to report in to the chief medico</seg><seg type="columnLine">for ear test. But Jimmie had come into</seg><seg type="columnLine">this game with the intention of fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his country in the aviation service,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unless he should prove to be physically</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfitted he was going so to fight. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly afraid and deadly ashamed; but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gritted his teeth and hung on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmie roomed in the same hotel with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jamieson. He passed the latter's room</seg><seg type="columnLine">every day on his way to his own; but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not often now that he looked in on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend. For one thing, his own primary</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulse was to hide from everybody; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for another, Walt was not at all companion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able of an evening nowadays.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Today, however, Jamieson called him in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The tone was both domineering and</seg><seg type="columnLine">derisive. Jimmie entered and shut the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door; perhaps this would be his long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited opportunity. Jamieson sat slumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in his chair with his feet stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">far under the table; his khaki tunic was</seg><seg type="columnLine">carelessly open at the neck, and his cap lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor. He regarded Jimmie for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time with a dull eye while he kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodding his head with sententious wisdom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then his lip curled in a foolish caricature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his old slow smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So it's come, huh?" he gibed. "What'd</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	tell you? 'S got you, hasn't it? Scared!</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's what they're all saying. Afraid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmie flung his head down on his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and groaned. He had hoped for under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing and sympathy from his friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jamieson rambled on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah, dead scared--my star pupil too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After all I taught you--'fraid to go up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was an emotional self-pity in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone that was almost maudlin. This wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Walt Jamieson. Or rather, not like</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he ought to be. Jimmie looked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. His own misery was heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough; but his concern for his friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowned out for the present all other</seg><seg type="columnLine">146</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">considerations. Jamieson sat looking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with foolish mournfulness. Jimmie</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen that look before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Walt!" he burst out with genuine</seg><seg type="columnLine">solicitude. "You're not--you haven't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching the stuff again?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jamieson flushed. Jimmie's suspicion</seg><seg type="columnLine">was enough to straighten him up in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. He laughed shamefacedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, hang it all, you know; it's an</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful strain on the nervous system, taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">up so many beginners every day; I'm all</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn out, and I need some stimulant."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmie stood up and stared at him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrified eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But Walt, you--you can't," he whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered tensely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jamieson was suddenly perfectly sober.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He passed his hand wearily over his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He couldn't face his friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I know," he said, quietly looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the floor.

I'm dead tired."</seg><seg type="columnLine">But tomorrow Jimmie was detailed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">some routine work which took him off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying-field; and the next day Jamieson was</seg><seg type="columnLine">furiously busy with a flood of instruction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was held late into the evening in a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">consultation about something concerning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big search-lights. And on the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">day the list had come down to Jimmie's</seg><seg type="columnLine">name for night practise. So Jimmie in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">continently reported himself sick; he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not dare to think of that flight before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have settled things with his teacher.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, however, toward evening it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumored that night practise was all off on</seg><seg type="columnLine">account of some other more important</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing on hand; so Jimmie put a bold face</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it and presented himself at the flying-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field pretending that he had heard nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the change of plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EflgS HE FOUND the night lit up like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the San Francisco Exposition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Long, milky rays from half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">search-lights stabbed far up into the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cut the moonless blackness into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">kaleidoscope of geometrical figures. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just such another night as that recent</seg><seg type="columnLine">one when he had so ignominiously fled;</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide, shifting banks of cloud hurried over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head at various levels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What's the program?" he asked a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sergeant who stood near with a sheaf of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight-report forms in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Spotting experiment, sir. Imaginary</seg><seg type="columnLine">raid from here on Philadelphia. Lieutenant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jamieson will go up and the lights will try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pick him up at both ends; they're just</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying out their current now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmie watched the display, full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloomy thoughts. He would have given</seg><seg type="columnLine">his soul to go up with his friend on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long trip, for there surely they would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to put his accursed problem to a test.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it was too late to attempt to make ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rangements; everything would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheduled long ago--and in any case, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would probably be a one-man flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His surmise was correct. In a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he saw a fast Curtiss baby scout</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled out into the open and the mechan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">icians busy themselves about it. Soon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain of the flying-school arrived with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a group of senior officers. Captain Wilson</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up into the sky with satisfaction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Splendid night for the experiment,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he remarked. "Bit gusty, though. I fancy</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll be able to follow him for at least six</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand, but I'll bet they won't pick him</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on the other side before he is right on</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of them. Hope he won't keep us</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting. Been rather a habit of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lately."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the officers stepped aside and spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an orderly. Jimmie could follow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man as he passed from one lit-up hangar</seg><seg type="columnLine">to another, looking in all the likely places</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a prospective pilot might be. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was away a long time. Captain Wilson</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to show signs of impatience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly a wild suspicion flashed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmie's mind. Was it possible, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. Surely not. But Jimmie wasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">no time in empty speculations; he stole</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the hangars and commandeered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first car which came to hand and raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to the hotel. It was only a short five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes. He rushed up-stairs and burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his friend's room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was possible! It was a hopeless fact!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Jamieson sat there a picture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dire retribution. His eyes burned blood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot with fever; a wet cloth encircled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brows; and his face was propped haggard</seg><seg type="columnLine">between hands that trembled like an ague</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Walt!" whispered Jimmie hoarsely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They're waiting! Don't you know?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wretched man nodded wearily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," he croaked.

Any</seg><seg type="columnLine">second a man might arrive from the field.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And there would be no excuse for an offense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that sort. The realization hit Jimmie</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a tangible thing; there was force</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough behind it to take his breath. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was preposterous to contemplate. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friend should be irrevocably broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the inexorable law of the service--</seg><seg type="columnLine">his instructor, to whom he owed everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew! It was almost a blasphemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmie's mind worked furiously. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly he gasped, and his breath left him</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely. For seconds he stood just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been struck, a cold stone statue;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then his deep eyes began to burn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly his lips began to set. Then sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly again he was electrified into swift,</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposeful action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lock your door," he hissed at Jamieson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And keep it locked." And he rushed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Wilson was striding a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatient beat and fuming with aggravation</seg><seg type="columnLine">when an automobile dashed into the field</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drove close up to the waiting scout</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine before it stopped. A lithe figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">all muffled up in leather coat and helmet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and goggles jumped from it. It saluted</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the distance, called huskily: "Sorry</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have kept you waiting, sir," and climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">agilely into the pilot's seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, boys, I'm all set. Let her go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything had been ready to the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">little item for many minutes. A nimble</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanician spun the propeller over. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught up the ignition with a roar, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light little machine sprang forward like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatient race-horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Wilson whistled his amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, he certainly was in a deuce of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurry to make up for lost time. Bet he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinning all over to think he's avoided a</seg><seg type="columnLine">censure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But nobody could see the desperately</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious eyes behind those goggles and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white knuckles which gripped 'round the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> control wheel and the grim-clenched jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the machine lifted from the ground and</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled to the left in a steep climb. Jimmie</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew nothing of any instructions which</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been given for the procedure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the flight. He knew only that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected to rise to at least six thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and then to make for Philadelphia.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he didn't much care whether he carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the program correctly or not; his only</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulse was to get away from there, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gain time while his friend might recover;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his whole will was grimly centered on</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplishment, somehow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long shafts of light stabbed at him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he circled. They lit up-the surrounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">air like day, coming as a special blessing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaven to enable him to settle down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull himself together during the first few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes. When the first cloud came be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween he felt an instantaneous qualm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat tensely expectant while the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtled on. But even here was a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">diffused radiance from the giant lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">below. It was providentially helpful. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself making the old mistake of</seg><seg type="columnLine">over-control and he set his will to getting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip of himself and correcting that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently a long pencil of light caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">him again and seemed to hang itself on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rushing machine; then another licked</seg><seg type="columnLine">across, and back again, and caught hold;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then more clouds. Then for an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pale flash passed him and Jimmie could</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow the thin ray crisscrossing about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling into the night like a ghostly white</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger; and then he was lost for good in</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale, formless starlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And still he flew at a very fair horizontal!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmie's teeth relaxed a little from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bruised lower lip and he began to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">with less rigid effort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far to the southward he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the flying clouds the beacon</seg><seg type="columnLine">light on the summit of the town-hall tower.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was a fair mark for Philadelphia, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew then where the flying-field was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He headed the machine for it straight as</seg><seg type="columnLine">an arrow. A hundred and twenty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles, his speed. If only he could hold her</seg><seg type="columnLine">level for about forty minutes more!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JIMMIE hummed along for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes more at his high altitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">on an astonishingly level keel. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clouds bothered him. He put her nose:</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to it and slanted through long banks</seg><seg type="columnLine">148</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of them like a shooting star. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">darker down below, but less confusing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Several more minutes sped behind, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them several miles. Jimmie began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wonder why he found the controlling</seg><seg type="columnLine">so easy--just as though there was not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single disturbing puff of wind. His mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">relaxed almost into a smile. He began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel the old elation of power and speed. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, right in the middle of his triumph,</seg><seg type="columnLine">something happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmie heard a thin shriek above the roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his engine, and instantly he felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine keel over terrifyingly and begin to</seg><seg type="columnLine">slip. Frantically he tugged at the wheel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his resolutions about over-control thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the winds. The machine answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautifully. Nothing had suddenly broken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as had been Jimmie's first blood-chilling</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. But that sudden diabolical stroke</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only the beginning. After that every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was either wildly over-controlled or</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopelessly under-controlled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All that beautiful security of balance</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Jimmie had been congratulating</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself on had vanished as though be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">witched away from him. Something had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone terribly wrong with the controls, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there could be no stop for investigation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For twenty frenzied minutes the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled and dipped and rocked like a leaf</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the terrifying blackness. Jimmie's</seg><seg type="columnLine">every muscle was tense with the readiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">for instant action and the sweat rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him with the exertion of it. How the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine lived through it, he never knew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a mercy of Providence that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept too frantically busy to think.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he finally managed to get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy controls in hand again he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself sailing in a creamy glare of long</seg><seg type="columnLine">convergent rays coming from far ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and somewhat to the right. Mechanically</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pushed the depressing control, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came to earth a few minutes later his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind was still in a whirl. He was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn out, mentally and physically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Officers crowded 'round him and shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand, proffering congratulations which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were beyond his comprehension. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">should they know that he had accomplished</seg><seg type="columnLine">something which to him had been a fearful</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordeal? He found himself feeling irre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistibly tired and sleepy. He murmured</seg><seg type="columnLine">evasions and excuses by the thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finally broke away and stumbled to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">car and eventually to a hotel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had slept for about three minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he thought he woke up still dreaming.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His dream was that his friend Jamieson was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking him fervently by the hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mumbling a vague jumble of gratitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">and happiness and congratulations. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentence impinged clearly on his con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By golly, they all thought you were done</seg><seg type="columnLine">for when that squall hit the world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh?" Jimmie sat up with sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide-awake interest. "How'd you get here</seg><seg type="columnLine">so soon? 'D you fly through it too?

"God knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">how I ever steered her. I was too scared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think.

The rains washed the sandy</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil, the winds heaped sand over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crops.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Lund, having proved more produc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive than the soil, yielded at last and John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lund was left with a swarm of boys and</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls who ran wild--human undergrowth</seg><seg type="columnLine">that thrived physically on berries and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">149</seg><seg type="columnLine">150</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fish and game--and starved morally and</seg><seg type="columnLine">intellectually.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, to an adjoining homestead came</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henry Barnes and his three boys. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were from the East, farmers seeking cheaper</seg><seg type="columnLine">land. Henry Barnes had theories and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief theory was fruit. His boys were</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong, had attended school and had profited</seg><seg type="columnLine">by their father's education. To the Barnes</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys the new life in the wilderness was ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture. The hunting, the fishing, the joy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of clearing the land and erecting the stout</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin furnished them a prolonged vacation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The beginning of the feud is shrouded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery. At first the Barnes boys had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to be friendly and to include their</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighbors in their sports and work. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps the Lunds were envious. Whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cause the Lunds proved suspicious, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighborly and had sullenly rebuffed all</seg><seg type="columnLine">advances. The year after the Barnes</seg><seg type="columnLine">family came into the Flats they started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">erect a line fence between their homestead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that of the Lunds and John Lund re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented the act.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two or three times fences were torn down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barnes protested; the Lunds denied. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys joined in the quarrel and there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight in the road. Afterward whenever a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lund boy met one of the Barnes youths</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a fight and, later, the fathers</seg><seg type="columnLine">took up the quarrels. Each time Barnes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had emerged victor from physical encoun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters with his neighbor. Lund, sullen, bit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, planned to secure revenge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One terror rules the Flats. Men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear nothing else show anxious, strained</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces when they see a curl of smoke over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wooded desolation. In time of drought</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is little sleep and the whisper of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">word will bring homesteaders leaping from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their beds. The dread word is "Fire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was this terror that John Lund in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voked against his foe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE NIGHT the Barnes family</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept in their cabin. The wind rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a gale that swept down from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">straits, roared between the Manitous, beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the old Sleeping Bear and howling as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if with the voices of the long departed Mani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tous, descended upon the Flats and raged</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if to tear loose the roots that held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil against its fury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On that night fire sprang up in the Flats,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fanned into fury by the gale and swept-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from three points upon the clearing in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which the Barnes family slept. Billows</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flame leaped across the narrow plow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, the potato vines withered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned, the pasture, dried by hot winds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crackled a moment and was black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Faggots of burning brush, wind blown,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rained down upon the cabin and, after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight Barnes and his boys fled and all night</seg><seg type="columnLine">they remained standing deep in the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lake, strangled by smoke, scorched</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the flying embers. When the fire passed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they crawled from the water, gazed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smoking ruins of their house and crops--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vowed vengeance. That day Henry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barnes found where the three fires started.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the Winter and Spring Barnes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his boys grubbed and cleared, worked as</seg><seg type="columnLine">never before, and felt the pangs of hunger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They cleared land the fire had left un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched, grubbed the roots of burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes and saplings and, as they dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush and chopped away the tough branches</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dead trees the father said, grimly--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Throw it over on John Lund."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By early Summer a barrier of brush and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes marked the boundary line. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">Summer and the drought came they piled</seg><seg type="columnLine">more brush and waited. In August a gale</seg><seg type="columnLine">blew from the south, fast, strong and to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the Lund clearing. At midnight</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire started and before daybreak the Lunds</seg><seg type="columnLine">were homeless and their crops were ruined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For more than twenty years the war</seg><seg type="columnLine">raged. Other homesteaders came into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flats, but few remained. Five times the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires had swept over the Barnes place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving desolation. Each time Barnes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sons set to work in grim silence, en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larged their clearing, and after each attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henry grimly ordered his boys to "Throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">it over on John Lund." Each time his</seg><seg type="columnLine">vengeance was heavier. He was patient</seg><seg type="columnLine">and could wait until fire was most effective.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With each attack the Lunds, shiftless</seg><seg type="columnLine">and indolent, became poorer. The Barnes</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing increased, orchards grew and bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">fruit, the thickets were driven back until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buildings were beyond reach of fire un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less the entire Flats were swept. The riot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of weeds and berry bushes pressed closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and closer upon the Lund cabin, making</seg><seg type="columnLine">revenge easier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twice, after the Barnes clearing became</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost safe, buildings on the place had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired in the night and each time Henry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barnes and his boys waited and, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind blew from the right direction, burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Throw It Over On John Lund</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Lund homestead. The Lunds, beaten,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered. John died. The boys and girls</seg><seg type="columnLine">went away, working on the lake boats, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">only Jim remained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Death claimed Henry Barnes, two of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys married and moved West, and on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two homesteads lived Ben Barnes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yim" Lund, hating each other. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">feud was not dead, but smoldering because</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben lived up to the creed of his tribe--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike only in revenge and then strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">harder, and because "Yim" feared Ben--</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared him because he could not understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man who could wait four years for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush to grow in order that his revenge</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be the more terrible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was the status of the feud when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came upon the scene, having built a shack</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the lake. Ben was my nearest neighbor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we became friends. He was tall and</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight, his long hair was white and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were blue. He wore khaki clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and moccasins, in Summer he went through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woods bareheaded and in Winter he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore home-made fox-skin caps and gloves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Summer was long and dry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thunder storms that brooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the horizon each day poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">their precious burdens into the lake or went</seg><seg type="columnLine">away growling, toward the straits and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land parched. Berries withered on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes, the Indians became lean and, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time, broke Summer camp and returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their reservation homes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The creeks and even the lakes dwindled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in size, leaves curled upon the trees, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corn withered and grew yellow, the choke-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cherries shrivelled into black beads on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees and the evergreens became yellow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ben came to see me at longer and longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervals and remained only for brief calls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He said nothing but there was a worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">frown on his forehead and, as he talked, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes roved along the crests of the great, tree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad hills beyond which lie the Flats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I visited his place he was busily</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged in mowing weeds, cutting down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">berry growths in fence corners with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scythe and, as the corn was beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">form ears, he cut several rows around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edges of the fields for ensilage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was his odd custom to sing a snatch</seg><seg type="columnLine">from some old song at the completion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">each chore, but for weeks he did not sing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Late in August Ben stopped at the cot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tage in the afternoon. He had been com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pelled to go to town for supplies and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastening back when I hailed him. We had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been talking only a few moments when,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, he sprang to his feet and, sniffing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air, he stood anxiously regarding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crests of the hills to the northward. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">resumed his seat and the conversation but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a few moments, leaped to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I smelled smoke," he said. "Have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">been burning brush?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," I said. "It must be from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen fire. This thing is getting on your</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves.

"The lookout at Point Betsie tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phoned. He says the fire is this side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Platt and spreading rapidly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ben who scorned automobiles and never</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ridden in one, sprang across the yard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaped into the machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get me as close as you can," he ordered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wait for me," I called, grabbing a cap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was three miles from the cottage to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crest of the range of hills, and as the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine reeled and lurched over the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">even road Ben urged the boy to greater and</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater speed. We crested the ridge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, gazing over the wilderness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A strong, gusty breeze was blowing from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the northwest, spreading a high haze of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke over the Flats, but presently a cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain of lighter colored smoke seemed lifting</seg><seg type="columnLine">and falling on the tree-tops and, in places</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame shot upward through the thick pall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As if resting upon the tree-tops was a dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare and, in the middle distance a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead pine, rising over the lower trees, flamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a torch. The acrid smell of burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood and leaves came stronger and stronger</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the gusty wind moved the smoke curtain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the west the sun was setting, blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">red as seen through the deep smoke mist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's a terror," said the boy, awed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grandeur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on, as far as we can," Ben ordered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The light machine ricketed over the hill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">past Long Lake and plunged down into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree tunnel. The air was clear here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the scent of the fire was missing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although high above us, the spreading</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke pall brought the darkness more</seg><seg type="columnLine">152</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. For two miles we rushed on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The smoke was beginning to settle lower.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We could smell fire now. Ahead in the tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel between the trees smoke poured as</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a chimney and presently the boy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangling and coughing, brought the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine to a halt. Ben leaped out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go back," he ordered. "I'm going on."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You mustn't, Ben," I said. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not save the house now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To - with the house," said Ben.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lunds' kids are in there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without another word he plunged for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward into the tree tunnel, his head held</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, running rapidly with the easy, ground-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaining gait of the woodsman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy and I retreated to the hill and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched as night fell, slowly giving ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the smoke became denser. Fire-lighters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">volunteers led by the rangers, were rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward to battle with the flames. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">midnight a lurid half - light covered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire wilderness, but the breeze died and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then blew gently from the south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Weary fire-fighters, returning for rest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">refreshment, reported that the rangers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding their own and that from the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">Empire had rushed rescuers, while from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">east Beulah and Honor citizens were bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tling to restrict the area.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL night the boy and I waited for</seg><seg type="columnLine">word from Ben and in the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">we went forward to the fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines. The fire still was raging, but was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hemmed in now on three sides and great</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaps in the forest showed where the axes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the back fires had stopped the spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the flames. There was nothing to do but</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait until rain brought relief, or the fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned itself out and left miles of the wilder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness a blackened desolation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the afternoon the fire-fighters reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Lund clearing. House and barn were</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoldering ruins. Three-quarters of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile away Ben's buildings stood, scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched. The fire had swept along both</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides of the clearing, doing little damage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, in the clearing not a trace of human</seg><seg type="columnLine">life could be found. Ben had not succeeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in reaching his own home nor had the Lunds</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped in that direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Exhausted and with hope almost aban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doned I joined the anxious ones waiting at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the life-saving station on Point Betsie.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Late in the afternoon a message, telephoned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">by a circuitous route around the burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">area, brought fresh hope. Traces had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">found of Ben and Lund. They had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut off from escape in direction of Ben's</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing and had made their way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Platt river. Clothing, cast aside in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream, indicated that they had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water in safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fire still raged on both sides of the short</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. Timber, heavier than that that lined</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stream further back was blazing. Wheth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er Ben and the Lunds had attempted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascend the river to reach safety in Platt Lake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">three miles above, or had tried to descend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lake Michigan no one knew. Either way</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would be compelled to run the gant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let of fire which, in places, arched tire</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Searching parties in boats already were on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Platt Lake, seeking the fugitives. Five of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, inspired by hope of rescue, launched one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the old litc-boats and straining upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oars, drove it along the Lake Michigan</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore toward the mouth of the Platt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tall trees on shore burned like beacons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there the fire still raged in thickets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the lighter underbrush had been burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">off and the fire was dying out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our eyes searched the beaches and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dunes as we drove the boat forward just</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the surf of the bars but no ^trace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">human life was discernible. Foxes, wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fear, ran down the sand and plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the water, to draw back and whimper--•</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught between two terrors. Rabbits hud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dled close to the quaking foxes as if seek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing companionship. Here and there por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupines waddled along near the water's</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge in clumsy panic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We rowed over the sandbar that guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mouth of the Platt and waited. Pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently the breeze lifted the smoke curtain a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trifle and we pulled into the mouth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river and gazed into the mouth of a furnace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The banks of the stream, piled with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangle of long-dead logs, glowed sullen red</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, a few feet above the surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, the smoke hung black and heavy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed that no living thing could run</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gantlet. Fifty yards into the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">we rowed and were driven back by heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smoke. At dusk we surrendered hope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were preparing to row back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">life-saving station to await news from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river's mouth when there emerged from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth of the furnace a strange figure--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure of a man, blackened, hairless, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Throw It Over On John Lund</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">153</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tattered shreds of burned doth hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was waist-deep in water when first</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw him. Every few feet he stumbled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell, disappeared for an instant, emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">and advanced. His progress was a series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fallings forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ben," we shouted and drove the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not hear us but pitched forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled a moment and lay lialf-sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merged in a shallow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later we reached out eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. Two of us leaped from the boat to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift him from the water--and saw the cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his stumbling progress. He was towing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rude raft by a towline made from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vine of the wild grape. The raft was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed of dead logs, tied together with vines</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, upon this raft were the bodies of "Yim"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lund and his two children. Lund and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">younger boy were unconscious. The older</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy, half conscious, was lashed to the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the strange raft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour later all four were in cots at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">life-saving station and trained hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressing their burns and wounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BEN had reached the Lund clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to find his foes fighting hope-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly trying to save their home.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had fought with them until the fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the buildings and they found them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves cut off from Ben's clearing. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">younger boy had fallen exhausted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat and the exertion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carrying the unconscious boy Ben had</seg><seg type="columnLine">led the retreat to the river.

At daybreak the fire around them</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew less, but the smoke hung low and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathed at the surface of the river. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben started to make the raft by dragging</seg><seg type="columnLine">logs that had escaped the fire because they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were stranded at the water's edge. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned to push the raft up-stream to Platt</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lake, but when it was finished found them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves too weak to propel it against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">current, so turned down-stream toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lake Michigan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The unconscious boy and his exhausted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">brother were placed upon the raft and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two old enemies pushed and dragged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raft down the swirling river between walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fire. Sparks and at times large pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of burning wood fell upon and around them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sizzling in the water or searing their flesh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They threw water upon the children and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben removed his coat, soaked it with water</seg><seg type="columnLine">and covered their faces. Twice burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees fell across the river and almost barred</seg><seg type="columnLine">the path. At noon they had passed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worst of the fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In mid-afternoon they heard the roar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lake Michigan's surf piling upon the bars</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the river's mouth. Safety seemed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, but Lund could go no further. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">vain Ben urged and threatened. Lund</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell in the water and could not rise. Ben</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted him to save him from drowning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For an hour they lay upon a little sandbar</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the river, waiting for Lund to regain</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength. Then Ben scented fresh danger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The wind had changed and he knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire might come roaring back through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dense cedar swamp that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely touched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He succeeded in reviving one of the boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">and together they rolled Lund upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raft and lashed him to it. His weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">submerged the raft until all its occupants</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in danger of being drowned. Ben had</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved this difficulty by lashing the older</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy to the rear of the raft so that his weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">would lift the forward end and hold the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads of the others above the surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the last mile Ben's mind was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear. How many times he had struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet, fallen forward and dragged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raft a few yards he did not know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two days after we brought them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Point Betsie station a heavy rain washed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Flats clean and the breezes swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">away all save the scent of dead smoke.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he drew back with an oath as she twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">free and stood, less at bay than ready for</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack, a dagger she had drawn ■ from</seg><seg type="columnLine">between her breasts flashing in her hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes holding Pugh's while one of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great paws fumbled at his beard where</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood was oozing its way through the mat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hair just beneath the line of his chin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All breaths were held, sensing the verge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tragedy. But Pugh, still fumbling at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard, slowly retreated until his other hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">back-stretched, f: It the edge of the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had pushed aside. His eves, no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing, but ablink, were fixed on those</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dancer and, as he leaned against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">support, he shivered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She is a witch," he muttered. "Look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her eyes. They are not human!

Pugh's hand fetched up against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rummer and tightened about it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted it and chained the raw cafia it con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained. As he set it down the dancer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze suddenly fastened on the ring he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">won from the quartermaster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She seemed to stiffen in a sinuous pose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the arm that held the dagger glided</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a white-skinned snake, back in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost imperceptible movement that pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">saged a lightning thrust. It came, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to sheath the knife between her</seg><seg type="columnLine">breasts once more, and she laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Know ye not ye must not touch me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she asked, and her voice, clear as a bell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to come from afar off like the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a distant chime. "Ye must not touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, for I am Death," she said. "I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">the White Death and this dress is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shroud of Love." Her eyes, absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearless, burned in their absolute belief</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what she spoke to Pugh's brain and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">all in that still silent room. The light</seg><seg type="columnLine">in them was uncanny, as if the soul no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">reigned behind them in its seat, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">lambent with the high glaze of madness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And they held Pugh as a snake charms a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are Death?" he muttered.

And he followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lights glowed suddenly in the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible windows of the little cabin and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the door open as the woman reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the threshold and, turning for the first time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew aside her mantilla, showed him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">witching oval of her face with its gleaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and, with the tiniest beckon of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, passed in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was but one room in the low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roofed place.

Nor did Pugh himself know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turtler Tom had found the shriveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and styled the islet Quatros Hombres.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Margaret repressed a sigh. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">balked of the pith of what she sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">even while she heard what caused her heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leap. For Will was still alive--she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely confident of that. He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a barren cay for eight weeks, nearly nine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the quartermaster had said Sunday,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the babe was born on Thursday night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nine weeks with the food that was an ag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravation rather than sustaining, the rains</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not yet come though they were overdue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but she was sure that her Will, her gallant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong, loving Will, would win through.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As her love had made her do wonders so</seg><seg type="columnLine">his would help him to a miraculous preserva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Then there were John, the canny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Alec, the capable. Oh, it was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to think of them perishing!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So now she bent her wits to locating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cay.

" There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hundreds of cays--no man yet knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">how many cays, since the charts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">acknowledged vague--humping themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the waves, just awash, arid isles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ocean desert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Pugh knew. And Pugh must tell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pugh would be more difficult. He was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">as plastic as his quartermaster, quicker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">witted, more--due to his imagination--of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a beast when aroused. Margaret swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">made up her mind to ply the quarter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">master of all he knew of Pugh, his ren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dezvous, his habits, his next intentions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This she would take to the king's ship--•</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was one expected soon at Providence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she would make her bargain. News</seg><seg type="columnLine">of how to capture Pugh in exchange for</seg><seg type="columnLine">information to be dragged from the pirate</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to the whereabouts of the cay on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had set the Graemes. She might go</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther and ask for passage on the king's ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet this course--and she reasoned so</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly that the quartermaster knew naught</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her mental process--was uncertain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pugh might be killed in the fight. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Scourge had outsailed many a king's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. She must have two strings to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow. The quartermaster was her surest</seg><seg type="columnLine">method. Later would come the ultimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">revenge if aught really happened to her Will.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the shuttle of her mind shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">nimbly through the warp and woof of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain, weaving in bright strands of hope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the land-wind swept down from the hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a sudden rush, bringing with it the swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">patter of rain. Her heart leaped. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sign--a sign that before many hours the</seg><seg type="columnLine">season's fall would be mercifully drenching</seg><seg type="columnLine">that scorched cay where Will fought off death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned to the quartermaster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a pretty ring," she said.

She read</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leavened his jealousy of Pugh, of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">master, she cajoled him and held out hints</seg><seg type="columnLine">of reward until he swore by all the gods of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea and land that she was a marvel and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would prove her so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The men are with me," he boasted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Pugh is puffed up with pride and has forgot</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fellowship.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would forbid them the freedom of the cabin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would curb their shore liberty, he calls</seg><seg type="columnLine">no conferences, he gives only half an ear</seg><seg type="columnLine">to what I set before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The wind blows my way now.

Behind them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">outdistanced for the time, more by luck</seg><seg type="columnLine">than speed, for the Scourge's bottom was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast gathering a drag of weed, Pugh knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Thetis, sloop-of-war, was following re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lentlessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somewhere below the sea rim her consort</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cruising. And they were all after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scourge. The hunt for Pugh was on, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">these three indomitable, untiring gaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hounds of the sea had viewed him and never</seg><seg type="columnLine">had one of them, or two, failed to loom on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horizon at nightfall and again at dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once, after a gale that blotted sea and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky, a frigate had shown so close to them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the swift clearance that the bullies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Scourge could see from their deck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow hull with its blue top-works and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scarlet gun-ports that opened eagerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to belch a broadside that came skipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scattering across the waves. Pugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">had run for it, outmetaled by this frigate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fourth-class but not outsaUed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the sloop-of-war had appeared, head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them off, and Pugh and his bullies</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought a smashing encounter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The sloop had diem inshore and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frigate was plowing along far astern,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that there was nothing for Pugh to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">but run the gantlet of the sloop's broadside</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he could forge ahead on his superior</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. This the Scourge had finally accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plished, but not until showering round-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot had taken toff of the crew and damaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gear so that Pugh had to fish his fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">topmast. Five bullies went overboard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground sharks, seven still tossed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">groaned in the stuffy cock-pit, their jagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounds attended by the leech with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough surgery of those times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their best suit of sails had been sadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent by the iron hail and they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">given no time to patch, only to change</seg><seg type="columnLine">foresail and two of the jibs for extra canvas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">well worn and none too sound. Altogether</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were in evil case. Their bottom was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fouling rapidly so that already they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">note the difference of speed and answer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the helm. Their water was low and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to smell musty. Worst of all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the powder was running short.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had made but a brief stay at Porto</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bello on account of the tip given Pugh by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tavern-keeper concerning the gold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship and they had been unable to buy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">munitions there. They had missed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold-ship, or the tip had been false, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were tired and lacked sleep, the grog</seg><seg type="columnLine">was none too plentiful and Simon Hart</seg><seg type="columnLine">assiduously encouraged the idea that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all the fault of Pugh, that the captain's</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck had gone, that he had had his day and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the passing of the "black spot" was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order. Such whisperings went about with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out any knowing who started them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pugh sensed the trouble, sensed too that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quartermaster was the brewer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed the day that he had taken among</seg><seg type="columnLine">his crew a man who knew navigation. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">far the common peril kept the snake of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rebellion coiled and only sleepily resentful.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once out of it, Pugh determined that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Simon Hart must die, in such fashion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crew should not suspect Pugh of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed. And Hart read the wish and the will</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Pugh's demeanor so that the two went</seg><seg type="columnLine">warily, watching each the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the continuous presence of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">or other of the king's ships in the Plata</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gulf that gave Pugh greatest uneasiness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">True, he might, at nightfall, slip into one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the many mouths of the Plate and work</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way through the labyrinth of creeks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was vital to refit and careen and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the stores and powder in the maga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zines at Skull Cay, but it seemed evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the enemy knew of the existence and</seg><seg type="columnLine">location of that rendezvous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some one had blabbed, Pugh knew not</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom. There were moments when Simon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hart wondered if the dancing witch had</seg><seg type="columnLine">played him false, but he could see no reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">for such vindictiveness toward himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her hate of Pugh he set down to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman's whimsy, a flare-up that would die</seg><seg type="columnLine">as swiftly as it had flamed. Nor did it</seg><seg type="columnLine">curb his ultimate ambition to displace</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pugh and see himself as a master buccaneer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a swaggering, colorful figure to be sung of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore and at sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile they were in jeopardy. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were closer to the land and to their haven</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the frigate, but the Scourge lay in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt of alternate calm and sudden, forceless</seg><seg type="columnLine">catspaws that sent the schooner surging</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward for a little footage, then died away</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave her with slapping canvas and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerking rigging as she pitched on the ground-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swell. But the frigate was coming in on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">full breeze. All her courses were set and</seg><seg type="columnLine">studdingsails had been spread in her cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain's eagerness to head off the chase.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On she came, lifting higher and higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they could see the gleam of her wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, its airy roll as it lifted, and the cream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing rush at her bows. And still the sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of the wind, dark against the sluggish</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore waters, showed sharp and clear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady, two miles seaward of the Scourge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently the frigate ran out of the breeze,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her studdingsails hung idle, course after</seg><seg type="columnLine">course wrinkled from their bellied fulness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the crew began to take in some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless kites. Under her own impetus she</seg><seg type="columnLine">glided into the calm belt that girdled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">schooner and lay there heaving to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pugh looked at the distant land and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the haze that hid the crests of the range.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked at the sky that was a blue flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he looked at the sea about him, a sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of greenish brass. He looked at liis crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at Simon Hart and gritted his teeth as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he walked his quarterdeck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "May their souls crisp in hell!" he mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, and the oath included king's men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was trapped.

His men, if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be called his, would fight hard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, but there would be no spirit in them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the sullen, desperate courage of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cornered pirate while the king's men would</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarm over and through the nettings with</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leveled his glass.

The little</seg><seg type="columnLine">flotilla split apart, they were going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack on both sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pirates worked like fiends, raising</seg><seg type="columnLine">a double-net above the rail, piling up their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ammunition, setting handy pike and double-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ax and pistol and musket. Many were</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed with Pugh's special boarding pistols,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he himself carried a variety of small arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his belt and slung from a sash that ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">across his bare and matted chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every man was nude to the waist, belts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were taut and kerchiefs wrapped tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">about their brows and each man's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was grim for the encounter. Swabs stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the inhauls of the carronades and</seg><seg type="columnLine">buckets of water ready to cool the heated</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal. By the foremast they were taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns at a grindstone, edging their cutlases</seg><seg type="columnLine">afresh and the sparks shone orange in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun before they died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And still Pugh waited, calculating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">range and the lift of the water before he fired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was the master-gunner of them all, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their only hope lay in smashing at least one</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, no easy mark as it raced on. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading cutter poised on the rounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">summit of a swell and Pugh, squinting</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the sight, dipped the glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">linstock to the powdered touch-hole. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Long-Tom roared and white smoke cauli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowered up from the muzzle in the still air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pugh, peering through the screen, saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot souse into the sea beside the boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shearing off the blades of the port oars</seg><seg type="columnLine">and throwing the crew into temporary</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jump to it,-ye, jump!" he yelled,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lending his strength to the inhaul of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, seizing the swab himself and plying it</seg><seg type="columnLine">dexterously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The charge was set and rammed home</seg><seg type="columnLine">with almost incredible swiftness and Pugh's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hawk eyes fiercely sighted the mark. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">missile plumped fairly into the cutter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragments flew and the sea was dotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the black forms of struggling men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">survivors of the deadly aim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The second boat swung in to the rescue</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Pugh laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "A taste of our metal they didn't relish,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he crowed.

The boats had turned with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men they had rescued from the wreck</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cutter and were speeding back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twice more the Long-Tom roared without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Seaward the sky had suddenly darkened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind pouring out of gathering clouds as</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a bellows, the swift riffle of it all about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the frigate now and reaching toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scourge. The king's men had to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard, which equalized to some extent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that the schooner was last to get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze. A fine haze had veiled the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tarnished the sun, a moan came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the source of the wind, a hurricane was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward. It was not a Plate pampero, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a true sea-gale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "A black mass to thee, Satan!" shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pugh. "We'll beat 'em yet!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sudden unleashed gale grew in in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensity. Aboard the frigate they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortening sail as she rushed on toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scourge. But now the schooner had caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the breeze and was fleeing northward, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind abeam, the sweet lines of her entry</seg><seg type="columnLine">slicing the long rollers that had replaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heave of the swell. The heavier frigate</seg><seg type="columnLine">heeled, her bows deep to the catheads, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">masts abend. A faint sound, like a pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">-shot, came to the Scourge and an unfurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">royal flew from the frigate like a bird. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">her superior canvas, while it held, smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her through the seas faster than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">168</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Scourge, which trailed a beard of weed</seg><seg type="columnLine">along her keel, and she held the windward</seg><seg type="columnLine">gage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The frigate did not fire. The distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still extreme for her range and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitch and toss of chaser and chased made</seg><seg type="columnLine">targetry a waste of powder. But her</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas held in the bolt-ropes, the lighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">sails having been furled before the full</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury of the gale broke, and she gained, little</seg><seg type="columnLine">by" little. A drenching area of rain from</seg><seg type="columnLine">an overswollen cloud passed between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two ships, hurrying to gain the shore with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remnants of its load and for a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so blotted out all view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following it came a gusty squall and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded topmast of the Scourge smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the cross-trees. Still the frigate gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now a long headland loomed up, barring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way. The schooner could not clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, but Pugh held on to his tack until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last moment before he ordered--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Bout ship!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pirates hauled madly on the sheets</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Scourge spun on her keel and clawed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a frantic way seaward into the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gale with the king's ship, plunging like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bull, coming fast up. As the schooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed her bows the frigate yawed and fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurted from her dripping sides. Round</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot screeched through the rigging above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voice of the storm, round shot gouged</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Scourge's planks and tore away her rail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">round shot slugged into her side-planks as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she rose to the roll of the sea. Peak and</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat halyards of the mainsail were torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">away as the blocks came smashing down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canvas drooped like the broken wing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bird and the schooner fell off in the trough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Two men swarmed aloft with repair</seg><seg type="columnLine">tackle, but as she rose to the pitch of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great waves another volley came and men</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped groaning while Pugh cursed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their impotence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Satan take me, but send rain," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bawled as he stood at the wheel astride</seg><seg type="columnLine">the headless helmsman who had fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his feet in the last discharge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above them an ebon cloud was rived with</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning, and from the gash a blinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">torrent fell, hiding sea and sky, battering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deck and hissing in the scuppers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">striving to flatten the rearing waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ran and leaped uncontrolled as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurricane reached its height.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mainsail, reefed close, rose again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the stricken schooner gained headway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Pugh could not see the frigate for the storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and darkness, but he knew she too must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have tacked to avoid the cape and was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">using every effort to combat the gale. Out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sea they fought, foot by foot, under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inky pall of the sky, while the thunder</seg><seg type="columnLine">pealed and the rain thudded down. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">only as a blue javelin split the clouds from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the zenith did Pugh catch a glimpse of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboring frigate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hour after hour they beat out until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had struggled through to the skirts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempest, and at sunset sailed a troubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">but subsiding sea without sail in sight or</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall of land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">REPRISAL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT MIDNIGHT Pugh sat alone in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin. Neither his lieutenant, Folsom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leech, nor Simon Hart, who slept in</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny cubbyholes that opened from the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin, had come aft since they had run</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the storm. All three were forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the men, and though Pugh had closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">transom and door against the sound, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was conscious of snatches of song and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunken shouting in the bows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time he had lost control</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his men. They had refused to clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship after they had run out of the gale,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Pugh, swallowing his black wrath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had let the matter go under Simon Hart's</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling excuse that the hands were dog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It presaged trouble; Pugh realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">very plainly.

He could hardly believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had dropped the whip and lost the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power over his bullies. They were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">brainless--save Simon Hart. Left to them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves they knew naught but to drink, sing</seg><seg type="columnLine">or listen to bragging, evil yarns. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">never thought. A story-spinner could hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, any one with initiative could get an</seg><seg type="columnLine">audience, the last thought placed in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads was the prime one, and Simon Hart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crafty devil, had worked upon them</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a modeler would handle clay until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all of his pattern.

In the stern were</seg><seg type="columnLine">two kegs and a baling pannikin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pugh managed to get one arm across his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face to shade the furnace of the sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly recollection came back to him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">disjointed fragments as it had registered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He remembered the drugging and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">killing of Folsom--that was a deed well</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserved and well done--then the breaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the skylight, the battering down of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, with himself rising and fighting like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in his sleep. He remembered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">taunting face of Simon Hart, then he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired at it and missed, but had hit some one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a face back of Hart had changed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a triumphant grin to a mask of pain. Some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one had struck him on the head from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind--and that had been the end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And they had not killed him. Why?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He lifted his head and exquisite agony</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread from a spot above his right ear</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it surged like a white flame through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his consciousness. The blow must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid bare his brain. He feared to touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place. It seemed to him he would feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pulsing matter oozing at the contact.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As an egg when the shell is broken but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">membrane holds intact and dimly shows</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yolk. That was how his head must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sun was frying his brains! Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could use them. He was still alive!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the remnant of the cursed drug that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound him. Presently he would get up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">make an effort, plan the future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lapsed again. When he revived he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay in shadow. The sky was a bowl of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jade above him and the boat was moving,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossing to one side and another unevenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if in the jobble of a tide-rip. The'pain</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his brain was less, the vitality seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have come back to him somewhat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he was terribly cramped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">terribly weak, so that the best he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do was to crawl and twist himself to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huddle in the stern close to the two kegs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no wind, no tide-rip, no motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the placid sea of peacock-blue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blunt muzzles reared above the surface,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray forms rubbed against the planks like</seg><seg type="columnLine">great cats that arch and scrape their backs</seg><seg type="columnLine">while waiting to be fed. The boat swayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swerved as the sharks forged under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the keel and lifted it. There were two</seg><seg type="columnLine">score of them or more, silently, persistently</seg><seg type="columnLine">striving to upset the thing that kept from</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the food they sensed and craved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was cooler. It had rained yesterday,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow it would likely rain again, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rains were fairly started. But mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, with his partial revival, there came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">craving for food and water, principally for</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. Pugh knew what was in the kegs</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside him before he made certain of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had given him "Pugh's Provender,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same brandy and salt-meat he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">devised for those he had marooned. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could only strike land somewhere and</seg><seg type="columnLine">find puddles and pools of yesterday's down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pour. He seemed partly paralyzed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drug, and he hitched himself up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">elbows and hands to a higher position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far to the south he thought he glimpsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue phantom of a sail. That would</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Marooner</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be the Scourge. There must have been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze when they had put him overboard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pugh prayed that one of the king's ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">might come up and demolish the schooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hang Simon Hart to the yardarm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicking and jerking like an impaled crab.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun dropped and evening swiftly fled</seg><seg type="columnLine">before night. Pugh could no longer quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">control his mind. He was still afraid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch the wound he had received. It must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been from belaying pin or marlinspike,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought, and he held the belief that only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thin integument lay between his brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the air. Once let that be picrced and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would die.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All night gray sharks trailed with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, muzzling, nudging each other in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghastly cortege. Sooner or later what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the boat would come to them. Sooner--</seg><seg type="columnLine">or later. Once Pugh thought he heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boom of guns across the watery sounding-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board, but he could not be sure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon after that he began to see shapes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated on thwart and gunwales, some with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their dried arms folded and their desiccated</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies in the water. There were others</seg><seg type="columnLine">who grinned at him from the bows. Folsom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leech, with his severed throat, and Simon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hart! Good--if that was Simon's ghost</seg><seg type="columnLine">Simon was dead and he, Pugh, was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive, very weak, but alive! And there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore still the better man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shapes were those of men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">women. Vaguely he remembered some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. He had marooned them. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one phantom of a girl with great black</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. She had died by her own hand--</seg><seg type="columnLine">after. . . . And there were the four men</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had left on the cay. He had left three</seg><seg type="columnLine">there just recently. Where were they?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ah, there--there on the next thwart! One</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bald-headed. Priest-face he had called</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The boat began to slide along in the grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some mysterious current, for there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no breeze, no veil in the sky to herald rain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Water! There it was, a hidden stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">running underneath the keel. And he too</seg><seg type="columnLine">weak to dig for it. Once he had seen a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">with divining rods. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dawn rushed up and the phantoms dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared. The boat rocked. The gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapes were breaking water now. Pugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">essayed to pick up an oar and batted feebly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the snouts that showed. The boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">swerved. They were trying to capsize it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boat moved on, grounded and now the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">blood-beat in his brain grew louder. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was surf breaking on low land. Pugh craned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head painfully. He was being carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast by flood and current to a sandy beach</seg><seg type="columnLine">dotted with gray shrubs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Land! And somewhere in some rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">crevice there must be water. The boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">bumped, dragged, lifted and bumped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. A swell tilted the stem and swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat on to strand it on the shore. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray shapes were cheated, left behind in</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper water. He was ashore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somehow he got out and collapsed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wet sand. Then some vital spark</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightened and he began to crawl me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanically up the slope. There were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks about that his bleary eyes could see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there were marks that showed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">turtles had been there. How fresh the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail he could not tell. He could no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason, his moves were instinctive. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">low mounds loomed ahead. They should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be where the turtles had covered their eggs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He clawed with painful effort and unearthed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grinning skull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tried to scramble from the place and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones grasped at him from the loosened</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand. With a prodigious effort he got to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees and so to tottering feet. Out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palmetto scrub three grisly figures came</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him, ragged, thin--one of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a bald head. The others. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pugh turned and lurched down the slope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was blind and dizzy, his brain afire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could not see his boat, and staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">on with outspread arms, pursued by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">phantoms. He heard the lap of water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the old swimming-pool! He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">dive and escape. There was a gap behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old root. Waist-deep he splashed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lagoon, scooping up the salt sea and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking it nectar. Then he struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">verge of a tide-swept gulf and plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A gray shape, followed swiftly by another</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet another, rose, swirled and lunged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a commotion under the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sent long ripples diverging on the top,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripples stained with crimson that rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissolved to streamers of pink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">" 'TWAS Pugh himself!" cried Alec</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graeme. "The sharks have got</seg><seg type="columnLine">him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He has left his boat," said Will Graeme</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarsely.

" 'Tis an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain trip. Pray God there be stars to</seg><seg type="columnLine">set our course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE END OF THE CHASE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE gray of the dawn Captain Thorne</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his Majesty's sloop-of-war Thetis</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled as he picked up the pirate schooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had fought at long range as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted through the starlit, almost breeze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less night. Now the wind strengthened</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the dawn, the canvas filled and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore down upon the Scourge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the end of the long chase. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">schooner sailed but sluggishly compared</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the sloop, and while her stern-chaser</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired intermittently, the aim was bad and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shot fell short.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are saving on the charges. Pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der's low," he said to his lieutenant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We've got them now, Blair."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman standing by the rail moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to him. Her sleepless eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant. Captain Thorne nodded to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll have them inside of an hour, Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graeme," he said kindly. "Thanks, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">great measure to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pugh must know the island where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">left them. You'll get; it from him, Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, we'll persuade him to tell all he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows." As she moved back to the rail</seg><seg type="columnLine">where she had watched ever since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first shot had been fired Thome added in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an undertone to his junior. "If we get him</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive. We'll keep bargain with her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seek the island, but they can hardly be alive</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all her faith. Look--look at their flag!</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are surrendering."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black flag of the pirate was fluttering</seg><seg type="columnLine">down its halyards. Then it stopped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his glass Captain Thome noted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">commotion on her decks. A figure broke</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from a mob of men and fled down a hatch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. But the flag came on down to the deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cease firing!" ordered Thorne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the schooner seemed to split</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart as a gush of black smoke rushed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her amidships. A dull roar came over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water and the smoke spread above a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash of red while fragments of spars fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. There was a momentary vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stern and bow of the schooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunging beneath the waves and then, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smoke drifted off before the wind, a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackened scraps of floating timber, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling speck or two that vanished and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the career of the Scourge was ended.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Simon Hart, cheating the gallows, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken through his spirit-crushed men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired the remnants of the magazine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Margaret Graeme, pale-faced, gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror-struck at the spot where the Scourge</seg><seg type="columnLine">had vanished. Now the last hope of find-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Will was surely gone. Slowly, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging head, she went below to the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thorne had assigned her, where the negress</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat with the babe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She was still there, sick, despairing, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cry came from the mast-head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardly discernible, a black dot showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the salmon of the sunset sky. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thetis shifted course and soon the dot</seg><seg type="columnLine">became a boat making steady headway</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the northwest under a lug sail. Closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and closer the sloop came toward the tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft until all aboard could see three men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the stern and then a waving cloth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mrs. Graeme, a miracle has happened,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Captain Thome. "Your husband and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brothers are alongside."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Margaret rose with shining eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An answer to prayer is not a miracle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Thorne," she said. And, with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">babe in her arms, she went on deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There must have been a hurricane</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere," said Alec Graeme, "the kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">that comes before the rains arrive. Prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably it destroyed the growth on some isle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it's to be hoped there were none living</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it, but the drift brought the uprooted</seg><seg type="columnLine">palms to us and scattered five of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the beach. Two more we got by</seg><seg type="columnLine">wading off the point. Seven in all, close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to two hundred nuts, with nigh to half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pint of life-saving liquor in each of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That saved us. Sheer luck, I call it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Plus sheer pluck," said Captain Thorne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Margaret Graeme, safe in her hus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">band's wasted arms, knew otherwise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">DO YOU remember that several years ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">we suggest ed naming regiments instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of numbering them, or in addition to num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bering them? The idea is sound. Since</seg><seg type="columnLine">we've enlarged our Army, regiments and</seg><seg type="columnLine">divisions have frequently been given names.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It makes for esprit de corps. Also it is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural human impulse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of you who took up the idea was C. S.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Edmiston of Quitman, Mississippi, who sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested a regiment of musicians. But he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than that. He went ahead and by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own efforts organized a military band. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">band was accepted for service and, when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard from Mr. Edmiston, was stationed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the 114th Engineer Regiment. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself was expecting a discharge because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of physical disability (his third honorable</seg><seg type="columnLine">discharge), but his band remains in service.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AN INTERESTING word from H. A.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lamb concerning his story in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">issue. Mr. Lamb, like several others of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our writers' brigade, is still able to furnish</seg><seg type="columnLine">us occasional stories though in the Army.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alamut is not a creation of the author. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the four castles of the Refik. The latter are</seg><seg type="columnLine">more commonly known as the Ismail ians, a sect</seg><seg type="columnLine">that separated themselves from the other Moham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">medans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A secret empire, wielding murderous power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more powerful than the Knights Templars, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Council of Twelve, or the Ku Klux Klan!

A paradise so devilishly ingenious</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the warriors of the Refik threw away their</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives readily in order to return, as they supposed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the joys of the Ismailian paradise!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TpHESE were startling particulars, even for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventurous times of the thirteenth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourteenth centuries.

The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Old Man of the Mountains, who should more</seg><seg type="columnLine">correctly be called the Sheikh of the Mountains,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was known to travelers and historians from Marco</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polo to Mirkhond. As to the paradise, it is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">known whether its power for evil lay in the effects</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the drug hashish or in an actual scene of splendoi</seg><seg type="columnLine">and license.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The power of the Assassins was broken by Hulagu</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khan and his Tatars some two hundred and fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years before the time of Khlit, but nests of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ismailians survived until the end of the eighteenth</seg><seg type="columnLine">century, and as a religious sect the Ismailians</seg><seg type="columnLine">number many followers today--deprived, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the secret terror of their ancient daggers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ANY one who can tell just what our</seg><seg type="columnLine">Camp-Fire is is wiser than I.

If no Americans could speak French,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish and other foreign languages it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would mean not only an immense com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercial, social, literary and scientific loss</seg><seg type="columnLine">but an increase in the provincialism that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of our national weaknesses. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a military point of view a nation none</seg><seg type="columnLine">of whose people can speak the enemy lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guage is at a decided practical disadvantage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say nothing of ability to speak the lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guage of foreign allies. My own first im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulse was a desire to sweep all foreign</seg><seg type="columnLine">languages from our schools, but second</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought convinces most of us that the rem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edy itself would be a calamity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND a needless calamity. Only the Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man language is now a danger. In its</seg><seg type="columnLine">case I am for drastic measures. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">languages are a different matter, one that</seg><seg type="columnLine">can safely be handled by wise limitations</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a more gradual treatment. As a first</seg><seg type="columnLine">step we might, for example, bar all lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guages as compulsory parts of any school</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, forbid the use in schools of any for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eign language as the teaching language in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Camp-Fire</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">175</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">subject except that language itself, and, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps ban the teaching of any foreign language</seg><seg type="columnLine">in primary grades. These merely as sugges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions; the subject is far too complicated for</seg><seg type="columnLine">settlement in a few brief sentences.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT the German language is a case by</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, a case in which the one pressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessity overrides academic arguments</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even consistency in according German</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same treatment as other languages.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The issue of the war is, at the date this is</seg><seg type="columnLine">written, still in doubt, but only a blind fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">can deny that up to 1918 military success</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been with the enemy. Their success</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been due to only four things--(1) mili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary and economic organization and pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paredness, (2) unity of command in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of trained soldiers, (3) sacrifice of</seg><seg type="columnLine">right to might, of humanity and decency to</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute efficiency and, at least as important</seg><seg type="columnLine">as any of the other reasons, (4) systematic</seg><seg type="columnLine">propaganda at home and abroad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We have been inclined to view this fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason, German propaganda, as bad but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">as vital. Yet if you analyze the German</seg><seg type="columnLine">success down to its very fundamentals and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginnings you find that systematic propa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ganda has been their most important weapon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It began several generations ago in Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">many itself, the systematic, governmental</seg><seg type="columnLine">education of the German people into effi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient, carefully shaped cogs in the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hun machine of brute force. The second</seg><seg type="columnLine">step was the planting of Germans in other</seg><seg type="columnLine">countries, notably Russia, the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States and Latin America, generally as citi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zens of these countries but always held to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germany and Germany's interests by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible steel chains of German propa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ganda. The third step was the building up</seg><seg type="columnLine">among these hospitable peoples of senti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments advantageous to Germany's inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ests and particularly the fomenting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">encouraging of any and all kinds of internal</seg><seg type="columnLine">differences and strife among these peoples</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would weaken them against the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Germany would be ready to strike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE was no chance in all this. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck. No accident. Nothing but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coldly, carefully worked-out definite plan of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous size. And the whole sum and</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance of that plan, the very heart of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Hun propaganda and education. Sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle, delicate, psychological, invisible and</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost unsuspected. When sometimes we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed a silken thread of the great Hun web</seg><seg type="columnLine">we failed to realize that it was not silk but</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel.

That is merely ordinary enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">activity--mere child's play compared to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">less visible instruments, and not half so</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious. Spies and bombs produce quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">results; these more subtle instruments may</seg><seg type="columnLine">not produce results for years or generations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but their results arc infinitely more danger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous to us and--more permanent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would take years and volumes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">specify all the tiny and various means em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ployed, but as a whole they can be quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaged by considering the central Hun ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine at Berlin that for years and years has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been systematically spinning this silk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel web. Do you know that at Berlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is a regular and permanent govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment department officially called "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bureau of Enemy Psychology"?

First, it made us resolve to get as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">full and detailed information on firearms</seg><seg type="columnLine">as possible for reference here in the office.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Second, it made me see that this informa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion would be both interesting.and valuable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to most of you. There's quite a lot of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even in condensed form, but it follows here</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as it came in to us and I know most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll have a good time with it. Here is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the letter from Mr. Brown:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I noticed in the Camp-Fire talks that you say</seg><seg type="columnLine">you welcome any suggestions that tend to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure better, which, of course, is right. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">here are a couple, small matters, to be sure, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't really have any effect on the stories but which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would make them sound more realistic:.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In the first place, I see in stories now and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">references made to .41 and .44 caliber automatics.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is no such thing as a .41 or .44 automatic pistol,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only automatic calibers now made being .22, .25,</seg><seg type="columnLine">.30, .32, .35, .38, .45. Knowing this, the discrep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancies mentioned above are very jarring to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Also, there is reference made in a story in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">last issue of a man shooting an automatic and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun simply screaming as it poured its bullets forth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An automatic does not fire more than one shot to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trigger-pull and no one can work one fast enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make the mechanism scream, or anywhere near</seg><seg type="columnLine">it; and I might state that revolvers can and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been fired faster than any automatic ever was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It (the story) makes mention of the delicate trig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger, evidently meaning light trigger-pull. No auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic has a light trigger-pull, all having stiffer pulls</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a revolver, as to make them light would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cause the probable death of the operator from</seg><seg type="columnLine">premature explosion caused from the jarring off of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arm from the reaction of the slide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Also, I hate to read about "automatic revolvers."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There ain't no such animal." An automatic is</seg><seg type="columnLine">either a pistol or a machine gun, and no revolver is</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic. Also, if any one thinks he can shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">an automatic under water he'd better take my</seg><seg type="columnLine">advice and not try it. Ht; might not get hurt, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chances are he would.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Also, in the last issue there is a story in which a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man has an automatic under water in a lake, dives</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it and, coming to the surface, shoots his man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and later states that they (the automatics) work</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right when wet. Well, they may work all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right when wet, and would fire the first shot all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, but unless the water had time to nm out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the slide-spring recess and the magazine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barrel they wouldn't function for the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I know all of the above, having tried them all</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the exception of shooting the gun under</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. I wrote two pistol factories about it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I78</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I</seg><seg type="columnLine">Firearms, Old and New	179</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they told me most emphatically not to try it, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">t would unquestionably be disastrous. Have owned</seg><seg type="columnLine">several of eveiy model and make and caliber of</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver and pistol obtainable in this country and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few not obtainable here.--Lloyd F. Brown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I wrote to Mr. Brown and in reply came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the following interesting letter:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am glad to see that you took the suggestions</seg><seg type="columnLine">I made in the spirit in which they were intended.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can appreciate your position as to proof-readers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">etc., as I am a newspaper man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Your idea as to arranging a list of firearms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the different makes and calibers of arms is a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, but this subject is a pretty extensive one. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have noticed that most discrepancies in this line</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc made as to revolvers and automatic pistols and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their respective calibers and possibilities. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">truly wonderful the things writers can do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">small arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Most of them seem to have the idea that auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic pistols fire their whole magazines by simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding back the trigger. This, as I pointed out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my previous letter, is not the case. It can be done</seg><seg type="columnLine">by filing off or removing the safety-sear which regu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lates this, but it would probably be disastrous to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the party holding the arm. Automatics have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp recoil, public opinion to the contrary not-</seg><seg type="columnLine">withstanding; and, as each shot throws the muzzle</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a little more, the last few shots would no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot the shooter in the head. An automatic can</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be held rigidly solid, even the smaller calibers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of the lightning-like shifting of balance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">recoil. One must brace the hand for the back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward plunge of the action-slide and then brace in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other direction for the forward plunge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same, which can not be done, as the action is too</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid. Also, it has somewhat the effect of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric shock. I once fired three shots from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">.32-caliber Colt automatic which had been treated</seg><seg type="columnLine">to act like a machine gun. I put only three car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tridges in the arm, as I knew how the gun would</seg><seg type="columnLine">act and I wanted it to stop shooting by the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was pointed straight up, at least, and the result</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that I felt as if I had grasped a live wire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am enclosing a list of the makes, models and</seg><seg type="columnLine">calibers of small arms obtainable in this country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which may be of some use to you. If so you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome toil.

Firearms did</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not play much of a part in war till the beginning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">' of the sixteenth century, as till that time the bow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had a greater range. The shoulder arms seem to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have appeared about 1485. They were a novelty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The gun was in its element in the conquest of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Americas.

The flame</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was communicated through a small hole in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">barrel, the powder in the pan being ignited by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow match carried by the soldier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The arm was loaded as follows: First, the powder</seg><seg type="columnLine">was poured in the muzzle and a wad placed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rammed down on the powder. Then a ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">was inserted, sometimes wrapped in a greased patch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but more often not. This was rammed down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then the cover of the flash-pan was raised,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a little priming powder poured in the pan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cover then being let down upon it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great objections to the matchlock were that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was visible at night, it was liable to be extin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guished by wet weather, and it was apt to be fired</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a high wind blowing the powder on to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wheellock came about 1525, from Nurem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">berg. It was manipulated in the same manner as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matchlock, with the difference that the firing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was by sparks caused by the action of a toothed</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel on a bit of flint held by the lock over the pan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a great improvement over the matchlock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A curious tale is told of the Thirty Years' War: A</seg><seg type="columnLine">detachment of the Swedish troops of Gustavus</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adolphus was besieging a town held by the Aus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trians. The latter surrendered one morning, say-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that the great reinforcement received by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swedes made resistance hopeless. They had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glowing matches, they said. The Swede com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mander was loo foxy to let on that the supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">army was a swarm of fireflies. Who said "Square-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head"?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The flintlock supplanted the preceding ones about</seg><seg type="columnLine">1675. It is the invention of a bunch of Dutch -</seg><seg type="columnLine">brigands who were in the habit of eloping with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their neighbors' fowls. Not necessarily the neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bors' "chickens." This gentle practise gave them</seg><seg type="columnLine">the name of "Snaphanns," and the term became</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Snaphaunce." The wheellock was a rich man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tool; the honest robber was forced to extemporize</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that a watchful hen-owner couldn't see</seg><seg type="columnLine">after dark. He did it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The flintlock was made by all the gunmakers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day, but the English probably made the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones. I have read that a great London maker by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the name of Joseph Manton finally reached such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinnacle of perfection that his locks were capable of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighty per cent, of fires. Most of the flintlocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving forty to sixty per cent. The flintlock also</seg><seg type="columnLine">was difficult to use, as there was an appreciable</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause before the shot due to the slowness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignition of the powder in the barrel from the powder</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the pan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The American rifle was the finest development</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the flintlock, and to the skill of the frontiersman</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his Deckard is due our national pride in shoot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing today.

The double roll was done by hanging the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old single-action Colt's revolver on the forefinger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whirling it over rapidly. If the roller was</seg><seg type="columnLine">expert and the mainspring was not too strong the</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver would cock and fire itself by its own</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight, the thumb catching the hammer in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolution, and the trigger being pulled by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun's weight coming on it as the roll brought it over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fanning was a great favorite with some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more spectacular of the old gun-fighters, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never knew positively of but one man killed by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">trick. The Colt was held in the right hand, low</seg><seg type="columnLine">down by the right side, the trigger held back, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hammer slapped swiftly by the left hand; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">result was a stunning volley of shots that rarely</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit anybody.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The road-agent spin was done by presenting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon to a captor upon the palm of the open hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, as he reached to pick it up, it was whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and discharged. Many a good officer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed in this manner, which is attributed to Billy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many gun-fighters removed the trigger from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Colt single-action completely; some tied it back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapping the gun with the hammer only. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick and picturesque.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A modem double-action can be fired quicker than</seg><seg type="columnLine">any automatic I have ever seen, and I am not</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly without experience in that line. I think a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in Denver, McCutcheon, has fired his Smith &amp;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wesson in one second for five shots. How's that</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a .38 Special, all on a man-size target?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The automatic will not fire more than one shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">at each pull of the trigger, unless there is some</seg><seg type="columnLine">defect in the gun. This does not apply to machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns, of course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As to fancy shooting, no one can with certainty</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell just what can be done. I have done a little in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my time, and have seen some really fine work with</seg><seg type="columnLine">both rifle and revolver. Such men as Toeperwine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Gus Peret can do things with a rifle or revolver</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you would brand as impossible, till you had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen them shoot. Gus, for instance, will hold his</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver upside down and beat the best that 1 can</seg><seg type="columnLine">do shooting in regular fashion, while I in turn can</seg><seg type="columnLine">trim die average shot in the same manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have heard of one desperado who terrorized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northwestern border some years back. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reputed to have killed about half a dozen of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northwest Mounted. He was said to be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay a rifle across his arm and, while working the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lever and shooting with deadly certainty, to be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to feed cartridges into the magazine through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loading gate in the side of the frame while keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a steady fire. This with a Winchester, of course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There is an old rifle with a history in a drug-store</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Baker, Oregon. It is an old 1873 Winchester and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was found on a bluff overlooking upper Powder</seg><seg type="columnLine">River, rusted into an unrecognizable mass. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally cleaned up so that we could identify it. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay under a skeleton that had a bullet-hole squarely</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the eyes, and the remains of about fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">cartridge-heads lay around. Probably a lone miner</seg><seg type="columnLine">or cowboy who had been driven there by the In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dians and made a game stand. Or it may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a cattle rustler; there have been some queer</seg><seg type="columnLine">things done on the edge of the land. I tried to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun, but the owner will not part with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now as to machine guns. As I said before, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know as much now as I will in a short time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Uien I won't be allowed to talk, I presume.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here in America there are the Colt, Savage, Lewis</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the B6net-Mercier. The latter is the service</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, and won the dislike of all soldiers by the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">it jams at a crucial time. It is claimed, and prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably with truth, that if one of the two guns in</seg><seg type="columnLine">barracks at Columbus had not.jammed they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have had the orders to get him "dead or alive."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would have been dead already.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The English use a variety of guns; I recall the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxim, the Hotchkiss, the Lewis, the B. S. A., and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many others. Most of the machine guns now in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Firearms, Old and New	183</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">use in the respective armies use the small-arm am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munition, but I understand that special guns for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warplanes are using cartridges up to an inch in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the way, here's a little history that you may</seg><seg type="columnLine">know already. When Hudson Maxim invented his</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous gun he offered it to the War Department</seg><seg type="columnLine">first and found a cold shoulder turned toward him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">England welcomed him with open arms and knight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood. Lewis, a retired colonel of the U. S. Army,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was treated the same way, and his gun won fame</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the "Belgian Rattlesnake." Incidentally, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous inventor Wiggins drew the same deal on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight he patented and offered to his uncle, like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dutiful nephew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Modern Firearms</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As to present-day firearms, we have a host of</seg><seg type="columnLine">different makes, calibers and models.

Sharp's pistols were</seg><seg type="columnLine">made in four-barrel types, also, but for small car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tridges. The Sharp, by the way, was the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">reliable breech-loading weapon we ever had. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vented, according to Bannerman, in 1848.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I do not consider the Hall breech-loadcr rifle a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">practical arm, as a number of men lost their thumbs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by its blowing open. It was invented about 1810.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  English rifles are made in a great variety of styles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and actions, from the old Snider to the latest type</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of bolt action for tlie high-power cartridges for big-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">game shooting. The favorites are the bolt action</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the double-barreled rifle. They are made in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">calibers ranging from .22 Savage high-power to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">.600 caliber and the 4 bore. I can not manage to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">recount all the different calibers and cartridges, as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some of the same shells are known by a different</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">name with every maker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  English shotguns are made in double and single</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrel styles.
