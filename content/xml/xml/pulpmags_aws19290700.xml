Over a dozen such magazines testify to this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But practically all of these magazines are of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purely "Wild West"--world war--adventure--</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky busting type.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I AIR WONDER STORIES imitates no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine in print, rather it pioneers into new and higher realms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet at the some time into a 6eld that is increasing in popularity</seg><seg type="columnLine">every year.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Briefly, AIR WONDER STORIES wid present SOLELY fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing stories of the future, strictly along scientific--mechanical--</seg><seg type="columnLine">technical lines, full of adventure, exploration and achievement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Years ago, Edgar Allen Poe wrote his immortal "Unparalleled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure of One Hans Pfaal," as well as "The Balloon Hoax."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Later, the illustrious Jules Verne gave the world his "Five Weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a Balloon." Still later, H. G. Wells startled us with his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparable 'The War in the Air." All of these famous stories,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it should be noted, fall in the class of scientific fiction; they are all</seg><seg type="columnLine">dramatized mechanics of the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thirty years ago, a famous man of science and a great mathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matician proved mathematically, that an airplane--a heavier</seg><seg type="columnLine">than air machine--was a scientific impossibility. Yet airplanes</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew before he died. Where will aviation be 30 years hence?</seg><seg type="columnLine">In 100 years? In 1000 years? AIR WONDER STORIES</seg><seg type="columnLine">gives that answer in an unmistakable manner. The reason is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the authors who contribute to this magazine are all trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">in science and mechanics. They are the prophets who will</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror the future of aviation better than the best aeronautical</seg><seg type="columnLine">authority.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Engineers and pure scientists are too bound by conventions</seg><seg type="columnLine">and far too practical and cautious to look far into the future.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They do not as a rule risk their reputations by making "in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spired guesses." Your science fiction author knows no such</seg><seg type="columnLine">restraints. Take Jules Verne for example. His "Five Week*</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a Balloon," though deemed impossible at the time it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">written, has long ago become an actuality, yet he was bitterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">denounced and ridiculed when he first published it. When we</seg><seg type="columnLine">read it today, it sounds hopelessly tame. Yet only 66 years</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervened since he wrote it; which again proves that today'*</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific "pipe dreams" are tomorrow's actualities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AIR WONDER STORIES, then, enters into this new land of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiction, convinced of the tremendous possibilities of future</seg><seg type="columnLine">aviation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having been closely identified, as a publisher, with scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">publications of a popular nature for over 25 years, 1 may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">pardoned in believing that I will succeed in making this new</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine the greatest and most popular air fiction magazine in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As creator and editor of such pioneer publications such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">"MODERN ELECTRICS." "THE ELECTRICAL EXPERI-</seg><seg type="columnLine">MENTER," "SCIENCE V INVENTION," "RADIO NEWS."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"AMAZING STORIES," "AERO MECHANICS," "SCIENCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">WONDER STORIES," "RADIO-CRAFT" and others, I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve I am qualified to do the new magazine full justice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am most happy to announce that I have secured the full</seg><seg type="columnLine">and enthusiastic co-operation of a number of well-known and</seg><seg type="columnLine">outstanding science fiction authors, who have agreed to write</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the new magazine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I am particularly proud and happy to pre»ent to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">readers of AIR WONDER STORIES the very distinguished</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeronautical educators who compose the science-aeronautical</seg><seg type="columnLine">talent of our editorial board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As associate editors, these well-known Professors of a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of leading universities and institutions, will carefully scrut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inize all manuscripts in AIR WONDER STORIES before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc printed, with the object to prevent gross scientific-aviation</seg><seg type="columnLine">misinformation from reaching our readers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For while no man can predict how far aviation will actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance in the next 100 or 500 years, still the limitations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature's laws will prevail, then as now. So while an author may</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a poetic license in letting his imagination soar skyward, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should keep away from pseudo-science and pseudo-aviation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he should not picture the impossible as far as scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">principles and laws are concerned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our editorial board, then, is a guarantee to our readers that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scientifically impossible will not be published in AIR</seg><seg type="columnLine">WONDER STORIES, but that, on the contrary, the educational</seg><seg type="columnLine">motif will always be uppermost in our minds. We must instruct</seg><seg type="columnLine">while we entertain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the future of aviation jpringj from the imagination! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">by translating the product of imagination into actuality, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolution of aviation will be hastened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And further as an innovation for a magazine of this kind is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the department entitled "Aviation Hews of the Month." This</seg><seg type="columnLine">gives a complete resume of the month's advances in aviation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Over 40 magazines and other sources are consulted in the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilation of this department. It gives a real educational digest</seg><seg type="columnLine">not obtainable otherwise in a single publication. New aviation</seg><seg type="columnLine">inventions, patents, new air-fields, improvements of airplanes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">airships, etc., are discussed intelligently every month.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the hundreds of enthusiastic letters that come pouring</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, I know AIR WONDER STORIES will be one of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussed magazines in America. Science Fiction as it will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">published in AIR WONDER STORIES already is a tremendou*</seg><seg type="columnLine">force in America. Everyone talks about aviation and *cience.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This type of story is constantly discussed in the da»iroom by</seg><seg type="columnLine">educators. Teachers encourage the reading of this fiction because</seg><seg type="columnLine">they know that it gives the pupil a fundamental knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">science and aviation. Likewise parents insist that their children</seg><seg type="columnLine">read this type of fiction in preference to the debasing and mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief-creating sex and crime stories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I therefore dedicate this new magazine to the air-minded, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the progressive air enthusiasts not only of this country, but of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire civilized world, who are not afraid to peer ahead into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am particularly addressing myself to that vast army of young</seg><seg type="columnLine">and red-blooded men and women who believe that aviation will</seg><seg type="columnLine">change the face of this earth--who believe that the future of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our country lies in the air--and finally those who believe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that it is first, last and always the great and tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of IMAGINATION that is the Key to the future progrew</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Aviation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With such readers AIR WONDER STORIES can and will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplish wonders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">DVictor MACCLURi</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We landed with a grinding shudder, then keeled over sideways as if we'd never right.

But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there was no mistaking that he was clean awake</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and in deadly earnest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  What I did was to put a hand under the pillow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for my watch. I said nothing. I was not going to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beaten in coolness by my own father, but I did</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some quick thinking. My roadster was in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">garage, so the five miles between the house and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my hangar on the beach was a small detail. I had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to decide at once if I should risk taking the old</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man across Long Island on the only machine I had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ready for the air that chilly morning. This was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an ancient seaplane, built in 1928, and now held to-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gether by pieces of string and tin tacks. In a series</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of experiments on stability I had pared her wing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">area down to the absolute minimum, and she asked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for a deal of handling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As I reached for my watch, I kept my eyes on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my father's face. It was as placidly grim as could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be, but I saw that he was betting on me to get</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him over to his old bank in quick time. So, almost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">before I had seen on my watch that the time was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">half past six, I had decided to risk his neck and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mine on the ancient bus.

Then I pulled the stick,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the old bus took to the air like a bird.

He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting humped up in the passenger's seat, with only</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes and the tip of his nose showing through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voluminous wraps. A grim calm was eloquent even</seg><seg type="columnLine">in those features. He caught my eye when I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back at him, and he nodded serenely. I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how it was, but it dawned on me just then that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a large-sized affection for my sometimes iras-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cible sire, and I turned my attention to getting all</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could out of the old bus for him. We flattened out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a nifty two hundred and fifty kilometres the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I hadn't wasted any of the old man's time by</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking him questions, but I'll confess that the rob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bery of the bank had roused in me a lively curiosity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The roar of the unsilenced engine put all con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation clean out of possibility, and I' did not want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have him unwrap in that cold rush of air to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put on the headpiece of the phone. So I had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep mumchance and speculate about the affair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was enough material for speculation. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">premises of the National Metallurgical, of which my</seg><seg type="columnLine">father was president, were generally believed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely burglar-proof. The building on Broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way was comparatively new. Its safes and strong-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms were supposed to be the last word in ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pliances for the thwarting of cracksmen, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">president was immensely proud of them. Altogether,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I came to the conclusion that this sudden flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the Battery and Wall Street was the result</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some swindle by a forger or by a dishonest</seg><seg type="columnLine">official, rather than of burglary. I knew it must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been something big to put the old man in such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurry, but I was far from realizing then, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Sieve flattened out and roaring above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">misty trees of Long Island, j-ust how big a thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was headed for. My father has since admitted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the time his conception, too, of what the future</seg><seg type="columnLine">held, came little nearer the truth than my own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I must explain at this point in my story that what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I write iii the following pages can only be a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal version of a bewildering run of events that</seg><seg type="columnLine">have since become history. I had the luck to be close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to many of these happenings from the start--as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world saw it--and also to be in at the death. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be my excuse, if any is needed, for trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put together a connected story of what befell in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick-moving and epoch-making period of six</seg><seg type="columnLine">months. Nobody will deny that for this space the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world was badly scared, and, now that the terror is</seg><seg type="columnLine">past, and everybody breathes freely again, I can do</seg><seg type="columnLine">no harm by telling what I know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I may even do a little good. The flight with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">father that chilly Monday morning in March was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beginning of my participation in a conflict that</seg><seg type="columnLine">for clash of intellect, mystery, romance, and far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching consequences has made the World War of</seg><seg type="columnLine">1914-18 look by comparison like a rough-and-tumble</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a back street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we droned along above the island, I had little</seg><seg type="columnLine">but my thoughts to occupy me. The seaplane was</seg><seg type="columnLine">behaving splendidly, and I had none of the trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had expected with her, if I leave out a little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">manoeuvering that came when we hit a pocket in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air. In about twenty-five minutes the Wool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth Building loomed up on the horizon, dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, and I swung a point or two south, so that its</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape fell on the starboard bow. Next minute I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had circled and was dropping northerly into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper New York Bay, with Battery Park in front.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Under forty minutes after my father had wakened</seg><seg type="columnLine">me I was landing with him at the seaplane jetty</seg><seg type="columnLine">west of the park.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was quite a fleet of planes round the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing-stage, mostly the bronze-painted machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the water division of the Air Police; speedy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinister things they were, but trim enough to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">my old boat look more like her nickname than ever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had never seen so many police machines to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether at the Battery landing stage before, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined they were there merely upon their lawful</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pierman, an old friend of mine called</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Grady, gave me my mooring ticket and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have held me inconveniently in gossip, but I shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">him off and legged it up Battery Place in pursuit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my father, whose impatience forbade him to wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me. It was lucky I overtook him, because a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cordon of police had been drawn around the Wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street area, east and west from Trinity Place to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pearl Street, and, I presently discovered, north and</seg><seg type="columnLine">south from Beaver Street to Liberty Street. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">police saluted the old man and would have stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, but he snapped one word at them, whereupon</seg><seg type="columnLine">they stepped back and let me pass. The presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of so many policemen at such a distance from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank made me begin to think that the robbery was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of an affair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Startling Tale</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">E went right up Broadway, my father and I.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I walked behind him, I realized again his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great bulk and, tall as I am, I felt for all the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">like some faithful but skinny pup tagging at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels. All about me were clusters of foot police</seg><seg type="columnLine">round the doors of various buildings. I wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop and find out what they were doing on guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far away--as I thought--from the scene of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbery, the National Metallurgical being up Broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way at the corner of Liberty Street, but I hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to my father in case I were challenged. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived at the door of the bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The squad of policemen who were strung across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorway made an opening for the president and</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, and I followed him right into his room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were immediately joined by Jaxon, officer in</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge of the armed guard which was mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">every night in the bank. Poor Jaxon looked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man who had just come out of a bout of fever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was in a daze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" the old man snapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jaxon simply lifted his arms and let them drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a gesture pitiful in its expression of helpless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness--especially pitiful since the man normally was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alert as a terrier and sharp as a needle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know what to say, Mr. Boon," he gulped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I just can't understand it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A quick look at the man made my father sudden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly grow kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '"Sit down, Jaxon," he said.

All the lot of them-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jaxon slumped forward in his chair. The old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man shot a look at me and signalled to know if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought the guard was mad. I shook my head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Way back there on the Argonne I had seen infan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trymen get into the same sort of daze after a punish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fight. Jaxon had all the symptoms. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sane enough, but a beaten and bewildered man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then a detective came in, a headquarters</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and with him was the bank's own investigator.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They both confirmed what Jaxon had said about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other banks, and both the detectives were as</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewildered as poor Jaxon. They could make neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">head nor tail of the affair, and when they had both</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished, the man from Headquarters could only sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shake his head, letting out staccato laughs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">curses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was beginning to imagine I was still in bed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreaming it all, and I could see that the old man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all his poker face, was getting the same feeling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He got up quickly from his chair and started off to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look round the building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was plain that entrance had been made into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank through one of the windows next to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main door. A section big enough to pass a full-size</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had been lifted clean out of it, and the steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">astragals round the panes had been cut through as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they had been strips of cheese. I did not need</seg><seg type="columnLine">the detectives to tell me that the cutting had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">done by powerful oxyacetylene. I could see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly enough when I examined the edges of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed section, which had been neatly set against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall on the sidewalk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jaxon led the way to the door of the great vault.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the president saw what had been done to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">elaborate piece of mechanism he grunted as if some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body had hit him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a neat aperture cut in the central panel</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the door, sufficient to let anyone step into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vault without trouble. The flame had sheared right</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the machinery of the complicated locks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there had been no attempt to find the easiest</seg><seg type="columnLine">line. The hand that had done the work had simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut out a chunk from the door, four square, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not turned aside even for the gun-metal wheel</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle. This had a segment shorn clean from it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the severed fragment was lying on the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was mighty good work even for oxyacetylene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without a w'ord of comment, my father stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the vault by the opening, and I followed him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The compartments inside had all been broken open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the floor of the vault was littered with bonds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and securities that seemed to me to be worth stacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of money. I saw a pained expression creep into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man's face, and I permitted myself the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">question that morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bad?" I whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bad!" he repeated soberly.

I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">say much to him then, for he is not the man you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can readily offer sympathy to in words. I just</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of put my hand under his arm and gave it a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a squeeze, and I remember how it flashed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that his biceps would have been a credit to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good heavyweight. The old man had a chunky</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown face that had the appearance of having been</seg><seg type="columnLine">modelled by a vigorous thumb, and had it not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his thatch of silky white hair he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked, at the moment in the vault, for all the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a bronze statue in a business suit. His fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">chin went up, and he gave me a short nod.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will take me some time to estimate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">damage, Jimmy," he said. "Just take a look round</seg><seg type="columnLine">the district, will you, and bring back as accurate a</seg><seg type="columnLine">report as you can of what has really happened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These fellows are too rattled to please me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right," said I, and left him there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Little Investigation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HTHE first thing I did w'hen I stepped from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">J*- vault was to get Jaxon into a corner and ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">him about the doping idea. I shot questions at him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but got little out of him beyond the fact that from</seg><seg type="columnLine">three till five o'clock he had been oblivious of every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. He had waked about five to find himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting on the floor of the reception hall with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to one of the partitions. He had no memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">of falling asleep, nor of sitting down. It had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if those two hours had been cut clean out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other guards told much the same story. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of detail in their accounts was maddening, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a minute or two I began to consider the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing a frame-up. But, beside the consideration--</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the report of the whole district being doped were</seg><seg type="columnLine">true--that the frame-up was unparalleled in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">history of crime, the guards were all too sincerely</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewildered to be lying. I could see that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not acting a part, and that poor Jaxon, in par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular, thought himself disgraced forever. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">heartbroken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jaxon had been with the bank for a quarter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a century, and his reputation for honesty and loyal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty was unimpeachable. More than once his faith-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulness had saved the bank from loss, and indeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been one occasion when he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded by safe-breakers before he shot two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in defense of his charge. The bank had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Cresented him with a fine big gold watch, of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">e was tremendously proud. He believed it kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">better time than any clock in the State Observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">10</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I mention Jaxon's watch because through it I dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered a curious thing. I was setting out to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">the round of the district, when I found that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left my own watch behind me. I looked at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clock in the main hall, and it seemed to me to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Is that clock on time, Jaxon?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ought to be," he replied. "I checked it with my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">own watch last night. Let's see-" And he took</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his famous time-piece from his pocket. He pulled off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chamois cover in which he always carried it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'm dodblasted!" he exclaimed, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the half-hunter face. "What in hell's</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to my watch?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gold case was tarnished to a dull brown-</seg><seg type="columnLine">green. From the look of it, one would have judged</seg><seg type="columnLine">the watch to be a brass one that had lain for days</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a sea-beach. Jaxon was bewildered, but I'll admit</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my astonishment--if I did not show it--was</seg><seg type="columnLine">even greater. From some little training in chemistry</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could think of no reagent, even in the most up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-date laboratory, that had such an effect on gold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The incident set me thinking, and before I had got</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the street I had discovered that the gold leaf,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so plentifully used in the interior decoration of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank premises, had tarnished much in the same way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said nothing about this additional discovery to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jaxon. I kept the fact to myself, and left him</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking round for polishing material.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it chanced, the first person I met on Broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way was Dick Schuyler, who had been in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying squadron as myself during the European</seg><seg type="columnLine">War. He was, and is still, a commander in the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">division of the Air Police, so I grabbed him to act</seg><seg type="columnLine">as safe-conduct for me round Wall Street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you make of it, Jimmy?" he demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight off. "A scientific feller like you should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a theory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know a thing about it yet," said I. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">cops should have more information than I have. Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">it right that these other banks have been robbed ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Subtreasury, the Trade, Dyers' National,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Guaranty," he said, making most of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthful. "There's a report, too, that the Post</seg><seg type="columnLine">Office has been visited as well." The extent of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair was beginning to impress me. Dick Schuyler</seg><seg type="columnLine">has a cheery, careless manner, but he is not given</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speaking without the book, and this confirmation</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought me to a realization of what the morning's</seg><seg type="columnLine">outrage involved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what were the police doing all the time?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sleeping, as far as I can make out," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">dryly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The details of the affair, as Dick told me them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were incredible. The first intimation that anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wrong in the Wall Street district came when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">policeman recovered consciousness to find himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying on the sidewalk. He thought he had fainted</seg><seg type="columnLine">or suddenly dropped into sleep, and in either case</seg><seg type="columnLine">was afraid of losing his job. for they want neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">sluggards nor heart cases on the force. He got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet, glad that he had not been discovered by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrol, and he began to hurry along his beat. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not gone far when he fell over the feet of some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body who was sprawled across the steps in a door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, and he stooped over to investigate. He found</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was his own inspector, and he had no sooner laid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hands on him than the sleeper awoke. Dick did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not go into details of what the cop said to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspector, or vice versa, but it must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty interesting. Anyhow, the pair joined forces</seg><seg type="columnLine">and set off round the district.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Green Gold</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY were half-dazed, the two of them, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their badly working intelligences it seemed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they had suddenly found themselves in a city of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead. All along the sidewalks and in doorways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even in the middle of the streets, sleeping men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were lying at intervals. Dick Schuyler wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bet me that there never had been as bewildered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of men in the history of the world as those</seg><seg type="columnLine">two cops, but I would not take him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is difficult to bring things together in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">right sequence. What I gather from the many</seg><seg type="columnLine">accounts I got that morning is that suddenly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police headquarters became noisy with repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephone calls, as bank after bank reported it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been robbed. Squads of police were rushed into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">area at once, but when they arrived the thing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and the thieves had got clean away. I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member wondering what would have happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the old system of direct alarms to police</seg><seg type="columnLine">headquarters. But this system, of course, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">largely discarded after the scandal of 1930, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the police were proved to have been in collusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the crooks who effected the big robbery of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dyers' National. It would have been interesting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see what would have happened to the police if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been rushed into the district during the unac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countable two hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other four banks were in a like case to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">National Metallurgical. For two hours in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning the guards and watchmen had been asleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">and could tell nothing. Something in the nature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxyacetylene had been used to effect entrance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the buildings concerned, and their strong-rooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been cut open by the same means. The thieves</seg><seg type="columnLine">had got away with an enormous haul while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">district was fast aleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I got much of this information from Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schuyler as we were walking along, and I had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to confirm a lot of it first-hand. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighbourhood now was filling rapidly, and auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobiles and motorcycles were beginning to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequent in the street. New'spaper men were every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, eagerly searching for information, but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the one central inexplicable fact of the mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious two hours, found little data for their write-,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ups. One excited little reporter rushed up to Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and myself, and danced round us, waving a note-</seg><seg type="columnLine">book.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say!" he yelled. "What do you know about</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, eh? Were you eye-witnesses?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As far as I can see," Dick told him, "eye-wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesses are just what there aren't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he shot a quick account of what he had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the little man, and advised him to get after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot police and the watchmen of the banks. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">little man wanted nothing so much as a reasonable</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory to explain the success of the raid, but we</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted that just as much as he did, and he went off</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an openly exhibited contempt for our lack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ARK OF THE COVENANT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">11</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The further we went, and the more information</seg><seg type="columnLine">we acquired about the affair, the thicker grew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery of it. The central fact was this--and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">else was relatively unimportant in the face of it:</seg><seg type="columnLine">that for two hours of the morning, between three</seg><seg type="columnLine">and five, the financial district of New York had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been peopled by men who, whether doped or other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise rendered unconscious, might to all purposes</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been dead, for all they saw. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">clue to the identity of the gang that had contrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">to break into five of the greatest banks in the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">and get away with a fortune in gold and easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">negotiable scrip. I heard that a finger-print had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been found in one of the banks. But I imagined</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would need more than that to lead to the recovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what was then reported to be a staggering loss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had a talk with one of the policemen who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in the district during the lost hours. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">general way I got nothing that was fresh out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his account, but he was a big Irishman who made</seg><seg type="columnLine">me laugh with the unconscious humour that ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his conversation, and I spoke with him long</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to get quite friendly with him. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving him, to turn back and see how my father</seg><seg type="columnLine">was faring, when suddenly I remembered some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the way," I said to the big fellow, "do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen to have about you anything made of gold--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a watch or a trinket of any sort?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He grinned sheepishly behind a big hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've a bit of a locket," he said, "with a photy av</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl in ut. She makes me wear ut next me</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. Don't laugh, an' I'll show ut to ye-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gave him my promise not to laugh, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced the trinket from under his tunic. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">much more surprised than I was to find it tarnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a dull brownish green.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER TWO</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clues and False Leads</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS around quarter past eight o'clock when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I got back to the National Metallurgical. I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">it difficult to realize that only an hour had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">since I had lauded with my father at the seaplane</seg><seg type="columnLine">jetty on the west side of Battery Park, and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a feeling that the time should have been close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon at least, for the hour had been crammed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">incident and impression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A number of the bank executives had arrived, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place already had a flustered air of activity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The chief accountant was with my father, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">judged by the look of him that he was a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">scared man. Apparently he and the president had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been calculating the bank's losses, for as I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the room the old man drew a firm line under</seg><seg type="columnLine">two rows of figures he had written on a small piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A good haul, Risbridger," my father was saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">casually. "Two hundred and fifty-three thousand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred dollars in gold. Two hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty-four thousand, seven hundred in securities.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But God knows they didn't take all we had. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">had better see about broadcasting the descriptions</seg><seg type="columnLine">and numbers of the securities, and inform the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police. If the thieves have not succeeded in getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the country, we may get a line on them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">should they attempt to dispose of the scrip. See</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this at once, will you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The white-faced official scurried away, glad to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have something to occupy his mind, and my father</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told him everything I had picked up, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened without comment until I had finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "M'm," he said. "That's a queer thing about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold tarnishing. What do you make of it, son?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know quite what to make of it," I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "My mind somehow connects it with whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">was used to dope the watchmen and the police. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff would have to be distributed in such a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">that its fumes could be breathed. The whole affair</seg><seg type="columnLine">has such unusual features, it might even prove that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we were to discover what had sent everyone to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep, we might land on the thing that tarnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jaxon's watch and the policeman's locket. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know of anything that has such an effect on gold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor of anything capable of producing the anaes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thesia. I'm inclined to think some sort of gas was</seg><seg type="columnLine">used. The first difficulty we're up against is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of the sufferers were conscious of even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest smell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whew!" my father whistled. "A new gas, eh?</seg><seg type="columnLine">If you're right, jimmy, we're up against a big thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When a gang of crooks can put the whole of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wall Street district to sleep and get away with it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">can you prophesy where the game finds its limit?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It opens up limitless possibilities," I agreed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's no saying where this morning's work</seg><seg type="columnLine">will end," the old man mused. "As it stands, if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other banks have been as easily entered as we have,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's the makings of a fine old panic."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If there's going to be ructions, dad--don't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think you'd better meet them in comfort? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a bath and breakfast?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man surprised me by letting out a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">little laugh, with a queer note in it, as if some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden chord in his memory had been struck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're like your mother, Jimmy," he said, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a- pause. "You have her fair hair and grey eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when you said that--I could fancy it was she</seg><seg type="columnLine">who spoke. You see, son, life was pretty full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ructions in the old days, and you said the very thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">she would have said when trouble was brewing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You don't remember your mother?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shook my head. My mother died when I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an infant, and I had never created any definite</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture of her, to a great extent because my father</seg><seg type="columnLine">seldom spoke of her. I expect it was that he missed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her too much. She had been dead close on thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five years, but I could see, even then in his presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dential room, how much she still meant to him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at me queerly, and I have never seen him</seg><seg type="columnLine">so softened either before or since.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he said slowly. "You were only a very little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow when-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He broke off and lifted his shoulders in a sigh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're right," he said. "Breakfast's the idea."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I anticipated that by this time there would be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jam in the subways and on the street cars, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wanted him to have as little physical exertion as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible, I telephoned for an automobile. While</seg><seg type="columnLine">we waited my father issued instructions for carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on in his absence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the car came, we rode uptown through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rapidly filling streets to a quiet hotel where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would not be recognized, and we both had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bath and shave before breakfast. I was wishing now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I knew enough about banking to stand by</seg><seg type="columnLine">12</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">during the crisis I felt was imminent; not that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancied ray father could not stand alone, but I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wish came largely out of the new realization of</seg><seg type="columnLine">how much I cared for the old man. I wanted to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some assistance, but I did not know just how.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I spoke to him about it as we were finishing break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here, dad," I said. "I want to stand by.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can be of no use to you on the banking side, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could be a fairly good watch-dog. If I can do any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to keep troublesome people off you, or if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can run errands or attend to the commissariat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">just say the word. I'll do anything I can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know that, son," the old man smiled, "but I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">well supplied with watch-dogs and messengers, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">know my ways. No. Listen. I'll give you better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that to do. My hands will be full of the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plications that are bound to rise from this raid on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the banks, and I won't have time for anything else.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In that tarnishing of the gold idea you've hit on</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that maybe will give you further ideas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'd like you to follow up your theory of the gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see what it leads to. You're an engineer, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll attack the problem from a different angle</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that of the average detective. You can have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a free hand in the matter of expense."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man's suggestion almost took my breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, and I fancy my face got red. I must explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that while my father and myself had been good</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough friends up to this, our ways had lain very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much apart. He was devoted to his banking busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, and I was immersed in aeronautical research.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There had been times when we did not meet for</seg><seg type="columnLine">months, and when we came together again it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply been, "Hullo, Jimmy!" and "Hullo, dad!"--</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty much as if we had parted overnight. I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right what I thought of him. What he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of me had been another story. That he had a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough opinion of me to hand me a job of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort, and give me the run of his purse with it, put</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in such a way that I could only nod acceptance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good boy," said he. "Now here's another point.</seg><seg type="columnLine">During the day you'll be free to conduct your in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigations, but I shall want you to fly me into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country every evening. I'm not going to stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">in town and have the telephone buzzing in my ear</seg><seg type="columnLine">all night. I'll keep Hazeldene open and live there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Can you do it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do it!" I cried. "Why, dad, there's nothing I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">like better--anjl if at any time I should be called</seg><seg type="columnLine">away on this job, you'll find Milliken a first-class</seg><seg type="columnLine">man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's settled then. I take it you have something</seg><seg type="columnLine">better in your shed than the old seaplane you used</seg><seg type="columnLine">this morning?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You bet. There's my own Merlin. Three hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">kilometres and more an hour are nothing to her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll have her tuned up for you right away. I can get</seg><seg type="columnLine">you from the Battery to Hazeldene well inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-hour."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bully!" said the old man, and rose with a cigar</seg><seg type="columnLine">going strong. "Now I must get back to the bank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">son."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Some Powdered Glass</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE drove back to the Metallurgical through</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets that seethed with excited human-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity. Newsboys were running about, offending the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ear with unlawful and raucous yells, flourishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">newsbills that smote the eyeballs with their flaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarelines. One journal, apparently despairing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjectives sufficiently lurid to describe the reported</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormity of the raid on the banks, had printed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheet containing nothing but one large exclamation</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark. Broadway was Babel. At every other corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">policemen were trying to move on the crowds that</seg><seg type="columnLine">inevitably clustered round each fortunate with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspaper, and so dense was the press at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower end of Broadway that it took two mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">men nearly a quarter of an hour to drive a path for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car through the last hundred paces to the bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once we were inside, I immediately got through</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my mechanic, Milliken, on the telephone, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him to tune up the Merlin. Wise fellow that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is, he had anticipated the order, and could</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise to have the plane ready in a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours. Next I spoke to the housekeeper at Hazel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dene and arranged for the place to be kept open for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my father and myself. In the ordinary way I lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a hut close to the hangar and workshops on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach, only joining my father at Hazeldene when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went there for the week ends. He had been at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cottage on one of these visits when the news of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the robbery had pulled him out of bed for our flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">this Monday morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was on the point of stepping out to make what</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigations I could when my father called me into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his room. He had come upon an old Eastern piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gold money which he kept as a curiosity in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the drawers of his desk. It was not of the or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinary disc shape, but was like two little beans</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck together crosswise and turned over each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. I had seen it before as a shining piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">particularly pure gold, but now it was sadly dulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a colour with which I was becoming familiar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You had better keep that, Jimmy," my father</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I expect you'd like to have a sample of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarnishing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was glad to have it, and I wrapped it in a scrap</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tissue paper before placing it in an empty match-</seg><seg type="columnLine">box to keep it from being rubbed. I intended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the tarnishing analyzed in the hope that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">result would furnish some clue to the anaesthetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">used by the crooks, for to my mind the crux of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole affair lay in the mystery of the two lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours. This was the thing I determined to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in the best way I could. I had no other notion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of where to make a start.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I reached the street, the crowd in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the_bank was thining before the manoeuvres of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police, and I waited in the doorway until there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was room to move. In a little I was able to cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broadway, and it was when I had reached the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite sidewalk that a slight accident happened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me which was the means of furnishing another step</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the development of my theories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To avoid bumping into a fellow who was hurry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing past on the sidewalk, I stepped short on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curb. My foot slipped and I came down on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. I felt my palms sting, as though I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed on some sharp sand, but when I stood up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to brush the stuff off, I saw that my skin was full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of little splinters of glass. It was no conscious alert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness that made me look down on the curb, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">just the ordinary human foolishness that always</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes a fellow turn to look when he has trodden</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ARK OF THE COVENANT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on a banana skin. My interest was caught by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smear of powdered glass along the curb and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gutter--like the result of breaking an electric bulb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only bigger. There was something about the pulve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rization and distribution of the stuff that made me</seg><seg type="columnLine">look closer still. I was suddenly taken with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">notion of what the stuff stood for, and I swept a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few grains of the powder together and wrapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in tissue paper, placing the tiny packet be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the coin in the match-box. My next idea was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have a look round the outside, at least, of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other banks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I walked down Broadway to the Guaranty Trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, acting on the idea that was simmering in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, I scrutinized the sidewalks and the roadway</seg><seg type="columnLine">round about. I half expected to come upon another</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the smears I had discovered opposite the Na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional Metallurgical, but was disappointed. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been, however, a fairly dense crowd all down</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broadway that morning, and I was not ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismiss the possibility that the same sort of smear</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been in the street sure enough, until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trampling of many feet had dispersed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the Subtreasury, at the corner of Pine Street</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Nassau Street, I had better luck. Here again</seg><seg type="columnLine">the height of the curb had saved the smear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">powdered glass from being completely obliterated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I took a sample of this, too, and numbered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">package in which I folded it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next I went on down Pine Street until I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Dyers' National, but this time, although I</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked as closely and as carefully as I could, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found no reward for my search. Remained then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last of the raided banks, the Trade Bank, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked round to take up my investigations there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Right in the middle of Broad Street where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">joins Wall Street, I found another sprinkle of pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered glass. Passing feet had made it very faint,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but luckily the morning had been dry, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">traces left were unmistakable. I reckoned now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had reasonable grounds on which to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">out my notion, and I contented myself with picking</seg><seg type="columnLine">up what I could of the powder on a finger-tip to</seg><seg type="columnLine">test its nature. It had the same character as my</seg><seg type="columnLine">two samples.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Pop Added</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BY this time 1 had four ideas firmly fixed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head, and could not be quit of them; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crooks had used an anaesthetizing gas; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this gas probably had tarnished the gold; that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas, in liquid form, had been held in glass con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainers; and that the smears of powder outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three banks were what was left of the containers</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the release of the gas had shattered them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These were a weirdly fanciful lot of notions, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit, but like the rest of those concerned, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more absorbed by the idea of the mysterious sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had fallen on the district during those two</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead hours, than by the magnitude of the robbery</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself. It was all guess-work, and probably mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess-work at that, but at the time guess-work was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about all anyone had to start from.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In any case, I thought the coincidence that</seg><seg type="columnLine">smears of pulverized glass should be outside three</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the robbed banks sufficiently strange to be worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">working on, and in pursuit of the ideas it gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">birth to I went in search of the policeman of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tarnished locket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was afraid he would have gone off duty, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">my luck held, and I came upon him practically on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same spot where I had parted with him earlier</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the morning. He had just been relieved and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going home. I walked with him up Broadway in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction of the National Metallurgical.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is a point on which I'd like to ask you</seg><seg type="columnLine">a question or two, McGrath," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shoot!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Before you fell asleep or became unconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">this morning, did you hear anything of an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosion ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He stopped dead in his tracks to stare at me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Faith--now you mintion ut," he said slowly, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe I did hear a bit of a pop.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">collected the six of them in a spare room, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioned them along the same lines as I had used</seg><seg type="columnLine">with McGrath. They all reiterated their former</seg><seg type="columnLine">statement that there had been no odour, but three</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, including Jaxon, recalled having heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint pop before dropping off to sleep, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">descriptions of the noise were, on the whole, fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to that given me by the policeman. Four of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, also including Jaxon, now positively remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered a faint luminosity, and the other two thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy Takes Counsel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I NOW took my exhibits, as the police would call</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and my theory uptown to a friend of mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">who has a great reputation in chemistry and physics,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clever little fellow called Dan Laniont, so well</seg><seg type="columnLine">off that he can afford to have a first-class laboratory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and keep a big staff of assistants working on</seg><seg type="columnLine">valuable but unremunerative research.

I wrote the name of the bank on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of my cards under my own name--which is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same as my father's--and handed the pasteboard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a messenger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Are you Mr. Boon?" he asked suspiciously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am," said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Who is it you want to see?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anybody in authority who has a minute to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">spare-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will Mr. Glover do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine," I said.

"You are the young conqueror</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the air, our modern Icarus--though I trust not</seg><seg type="columnLine">doomed to the same fate.

"Well, Mr. Boon, and what can I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told him pretty snappily that I wanted a line</seg><seg type="columnLine">on what had happened in the Post Office that</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, explaining that I was investigating every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that seemed to have any connection with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbery of the banks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Glover looked hurriedly around the room, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he were afraid somebody might be lurking in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner. He dropped his voice mysteriously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is, of course, strictly entre nous," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I can say nothing officially, you understand? It</seg><seg type="columnLine">must go no further?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I said I quite understand--and found myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispering like a fool when I said it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well, then," said he. "I will tell you, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boon. A very strange thing happened here this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. Five little packages, extremely heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">for their size, were dropped into the local collection</seg><seg type="columnLine">box during the night or in the early hours. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">box was cleared at seven, Mr. Boon, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">then that they were found. They would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped notice, I do not doubt, had it not been for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peculiar circumstance that they were all with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the requisite stamps--unstamped, Mr. Boon!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sorter put them aside, and when he came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal with them later, he found that there were also</seg><seg type="columnLine">five bulky envelopes, similarly without stamps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, here is a curious fact, Mr. Boon"--with an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other apprehensive glance about the room--"both</seg><seg type="columnLine">the envelopes and the packages were all addressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to important hospitals and research institutions in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city, an envelope and a package to each of five</seg><seg type="columnLine">institutions!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leaned back to see the effect on me of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrilling revelation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You amaze me, Mr. Glover," said I. "Certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peculiar and suspicious circumstance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wasn't it!" Mr. Glover agreed. "The packages</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all alike, and appeared to consist of heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">little boxes wrapped in corrugated cardboard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown paper. Well, now. Naturally the Office was</seg><seg type="columnLine">agog with the news of the dastardly outrages in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wall Street, and the sorter somehow connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">these envelopes and packages with the crime, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boon. He summoned his immediate chief, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">result of their colloquy was that packages and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velopes were held over for investigation by our</seg><seg type="columnLine">police department."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have they been opened yet?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Glover looked pained at my lack of finesse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not officially, Mr. Boon--not officially. Special</seg><seg type="columnLine">authority is needed for that." He dropped his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a whisper more confidential than ever. "But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can tell you--quite unofficially, of course--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the square packages contained black boxes of wood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside which were what at first sight appeared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be lumps of solid lead. Closer investigation, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, proved these last to be lead cases with ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremely thick sides."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What was in the lead cases?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Glover shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I cannot say," he said ponderously. "But as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am inclined to think some outrage is contemplated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should say--explosives! But, as you may know</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is a special department of the Post Office</seg><seg type="columnLine">primarily concerned with the handling of such con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tingencies, and at the moment, Mr. Boon, an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigation is going forward--behind closed doors!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You don't know what was in the envelopes?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once more Mr. Glover was pained at my blunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. That I cannot tell," he said severely. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">now have all the information I can lay at your dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posal, Mr. Boon--and that, sir, I beg you to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member, is quite unofficial--and sacrosanct. It must</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be bruited abroad!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I admit that I saw little ground for connecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">this mystery with the robberies round Wall Street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor any need for secrecy. I was inclined to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Glover's love for the mysterious had led him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a fantastic interpretation of some silly joke</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the institutions, but I thanked him with every</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of being impressed, and took a speedy</seg><seg type="columnLine">16</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">leave of him. I was not a little annoyed with my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self for having wasted my time on the pedantic fool.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But subsequent events, since made public, were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show me that Glover, for all his absurd pomposity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had got nearer the truth than I imagined, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had underestimated what was to prove one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most surprising of a chain of happenings that ul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">timately were to baffle the whole world. Yet, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I say, at the time I thought the thing some ill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceived joke on the institutions, or perhaps the</seg><seg type="columnLine">result of an error on the part of some manu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">facturer's dispatch clerk, and I took little stock of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without pausing to look into the bank, I made for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seaplane jetty and the Sieve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Round the landing stage now, in addition to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bronze-painted machines of the police, a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">privately owned boats were moored. Luxuriously</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointed craft, with their closed cabins and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silk or brocade curtains on their windows, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the old Sieve look more disreputable than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever; but when I noticed that one or two of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">swell conveyances belonged to bank presidents like</seg><seg type="columnLine">my father, I smiled to think that my old tub, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mongrel pup to a dog-fight, had been first on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene of action. And as I set the old girl skimming</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the Bay, I smiled still more when I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">how ornamental all that swagger fleet would look,</seg><seg type="columnLine">once I got back in its midst with my lovely silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">Merlin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She not only had the whole bunch beaten for</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer good looks, but--in the matter of speed--she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to the best of them what the hawk is to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peacock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER THREE</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Merlin</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE cluster of buildings close to Gardiner</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bay, where we did our construction and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perimenting, was beginning to find definition</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the white margin of the sea, when there dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the clouds in front and above the Sieve a beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful silver shape. It was the Merlin which Milliken</seg><seg type="columnLine">had out for a trial flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Until that moment I had never seen her in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. She was my design and had been built in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheds on the beach under my supervision. Her tests</seg><seg type="columnLine">had all been carried out at my hands, and she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never been in the air without me. Milliken had</seg><seg type="columnLine">often handled her, but always with myself at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">elbow. Until now' he had not taken her up on a solo</seg><seg type="columnLine">spin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To see her so, as an outsider would, was a queer</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience for me. I felt pretty much as a dramatist</seg><seg type="columnLine">might if he saw a play of his acted for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. I wish 1 could write down just what that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment meant to me, but I can't. The clean look</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Merlin gave me a thrill. I wanted to fly her</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself and be able, at the same time, to watch her</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was something of a surprise to me to see her</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in the hands of Milliken. though I couldn't say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had exceeded his privilege. It was quite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural thing for him to do, considering the way I</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusted him. But even while I was admitting that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he handled her splendidly, a sort of jealousy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold of me for a minute or two. He passed me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I signaled half angrily that I would land first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The graceful silver shape swept dizzily over my</seg><seg type="columnLine">bows, turned banking into a sideways loop round</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and righted again to come about after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clumsy old Sieve like a great, slim-winged bird. No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm wrong. There isn't a bird that could repeat the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manoeuvre, and I had thought, until I saw Milliken</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it, that only the Merlin and myself had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knack, but the mechanic had copied my stunt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stupidly annoyed, I planed down for the shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flattened out to taxi up to the jetty. The me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanics ran out and brought the old seaplane to rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shed, and I disembarked to watch Milliken</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring in the Merlin. She came down perfectly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hovering flight that had been designed into her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">and landed on the water so like some great seagull</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the expectation was she would next fold her</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings. It was gracefully done and by the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">Milliken stepped ashore my jealousy and irritation</seg><seg type="columnLine">were swept from me by a feeling of gratitude.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's she like, Milliken?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, sir! Oh, sir!" he cried, ablaze with delight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She's a dream! There's nothing to touch her on</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea or land--and we made her, sir--we made her!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now Milliken, as a rule, is prone neither to call</seg><seg type="columnLine">other men "sir," nor to wax enthusiastic, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement surprised me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You handled her well," I said casually. "You've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got the hang of that side loop all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, that!" said Milliken. "Why, do you know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a baby could handle her. She's a credit to you, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boon--it's all in the design."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This from Milliken was by way of an amende</seg><seg type="columnLine">honorable. When I first introduced him to the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of the Merlin, and showed him the wing modi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fications that were meant to achieve the steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovering which now distinguished her, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought the notion impossible. The idea had evolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">from stalling, and he then had the old fixed idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the only safe way of landing was to plane down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a thin angle and flatten. The idea of perfecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">a continuous stalling, in which the machine got into</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither tail nor nose dive, nor even into a spin, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply floated to earth as a feather might, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad to him. The principle is now a commonplace</seg><seg type="columnLine">in aeronautics, and how Milliken and I arrived at</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, very nearly at the cost of our lives, has little to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do with the story I have to tell. I mention Milliken's</seg><seg type="columnLine">apology to give just what sidelight it may on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's character, for he wants some explaining.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If I know anything about Milliken, he will never</seg><seg type="columnLine">bother to read these pages, even if he is told lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes into them--Shakespeare and real belles lettres</seg><seg type="columnLine">are more in his way than this sort of production--</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I may say what I like about him. In any case,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I won't say anything that I wouldn't tell him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own ugly old face if the need arose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have never met a man with as great a passion</seg><seg type="columnLine">so carefully hidden as Milliken and his love for air</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines, nor anybody with half his practical ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience and skill. He has the strongest hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gentlest. No fractious nut is too firmly fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his spanner, and no adjustment too delicate for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fingers, and I am open to bet that he has never</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripped a screw in his life. He looks about as</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad as he is long--which, since he is little over</seg><seg type="columnLine">five feet in height, is perhaps not saying such a lot--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with the most equitable of tempers the habitual</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression of his face is one of untamed ferocity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If Milliken had wanted to, he could have cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ARK OF THE COVENANT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">17</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the workshops in quick time, and I have seen him</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise under three big men, during a rag, and carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">them off like so many feather pillows. Like most</seg><seg type="columnLine">good men of their hands, he can control his fists.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I take it he knows too well the power in them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind them to use them unworthily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Milliken is the sort of mechanic who always has</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him a lump of cotton waste, and as we in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spected the Merlin that day--I suppose for about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thousandth time--he was rubbing the frosted</seg><seg type="columnLine">aluminum of the fuselage and of the shuttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings, or was polishing up the glass of the port-</seg><seg type="columnLine">holes. It was as if he could not get his darling</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean enough, for he fussed about the machine like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mother over a spoiled child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am not going to say that the Merlin did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserve all his affection. From the gleaming 1,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">h.p. radial engine, weighing just about half as</seg><seg type="columnLine">many kilograms, to her rudder, and from wing-tip</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wing-tip, she was all frosted aluminum, save</seg><seg type="columnLine">only for a thin line of gentian blue that ran along</seg><seg type="columnLine">her sides to spread out and cover her rear plane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the portholes and windows of the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin, a glimpse could be had of the sparrow's-egg</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue that decorated her interior, of the shining nickel</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dials and controls. She looked the littlest</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. Yet at a pinch she could carry a dozen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half fighting men. She seemed the most innocent</seg><seg type="columnLine">and peaceable of machines, but her speed and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of rapid manoeuvre made her just about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadliest thing that ever took the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We could take off the whole top of the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the blue line and fit a fighting top, and round</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inside of the fusilage were set stanchions for</seg><seg type="columnLine">six guns. Two of these guns, the fore and aft, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt-guns firing half-kilo shells, the forward one</seg><seg type="columnLine">synchronized with and firing between the propeller</seg><seg type="columnLine">blades. Beneath were hatches for bomb-dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">and torpedo release.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, at the moment I'm writing of, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Milliken and I were standing by her on the jetty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the fighting kit of the Merlin was unshipped. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had every permit from the government, but as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">law forbade any private machine to carry arma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and I did not want any inspectors dodging</seg><seg type="columnLine">around until she was quite ready, her fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">capacity still remained secret. I was putting off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time when I would have to say she was per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect and would have to offer the design to the U.

"Why don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you finish her off like a circus wagon and be done</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it?

It'd be a shame to</seg><seg type="columnLine">use the Merlin. You don't want everybody down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Battery Park swarming over the old girl, do you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wouldn't do them much good if they did," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">I, "but you're right.

His gaze was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed on the speed dial, and his lips were moving.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For myself, my jaws were clenched enough to hurt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Round, round went the pointer: Four-eighty-five--</seg><seg type="columnLine">six, seven--back to six--seven, eight--eight--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little more throttle--nine, nine--four-ninety!

I had a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear that to open the throttle any more would be to</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst something. The dial said five hundred, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was the limit of endurance. I couldn't stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more and I throttled down. The pointer went</seg><seg type="columnLine">back quickly--and I whipped in the cut-out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Milliken saw the movement, and his lips went</seg><seg type="columnLine">quicker. But I could not hear him. My ears were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still filled with the roar. The silence was appalling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tried to speak, but could not hear myself. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually the sound of a voice came to me as from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hell!--I knew she would!

"Just you look at the pack of baby</seg><seg type="columnLine">carriages! Oh, you bird!" he apostrophized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Merlin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bird be damned!" said I.

It may be imagined</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was in high feather, for the Merlin had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latest speed record look silly by an extra eighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">kilometres an hour, and I knew very well that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not been anything like full out. Given that</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing speed, her power of quick and easy descent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her manoeuverability, and her quick climb, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">every reason to think my machine was a world-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beater.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A feeling of great exhilaration possessed me as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked up Broadway, My mind worked at amazing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, and I found myself gathering impressions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the things around me quicker than I had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked them up before. The traffic appeared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawl, and although I was whacking along as quick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly as my legs would let me, I seemed to be travel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling at a snail's pace.

One man, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been driving an electric truck, had switched off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power just as soon as he felt himself go faint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To my mind the fact about the gasoline-driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">cars strongly confirmed my idea of a gas. I imagined</seg><seg type="columnLine">then that only some agent present in the air could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have affected all the automobiles round Wall Street</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same way, and I was chagrined to see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one vehicle driven by electricity in the district</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the time was ruled out as evidence by the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that its driver had stopped it himself. The street</seg><seg type="columnLine">cars were of no value in this regard, because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their self-stopping devices. What would have hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to the truck if the driver had fallen asleep be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he could switch off the power? I was inclined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think that only a wall or something of the sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have stopped that truck, and that it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have come to a smash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If my idea of a gas was right--and I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">no other explanation for the mysterious sleep or</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the stopping of the internal-combustion engines</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the automobiles--my notion that the thieves had</seg><seg type="columnLine">used trucks for their coup was useless. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the possibility, however, that knowing the effects</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their gas on engines using the air to carburet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasoline, the thieves either used electric lorries or</seg><seg type="columnLine">had some specially arranged engines using com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed air. Such was my fantastic theory, based</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a very crude mistake which with all my train-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing I should have avoided.

I asked. ,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes. He's fixed on that--but he might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying, don't you see? He's supposed to be awake</seg><seg type="columnLine">all night, and to make his rounds at definite inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vals. If he had fallen asleep, he wouldn't like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">confess it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where has he been taken to?" asked Dan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's at the local station."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right," said Dan. "Let's go there, Jimmy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The watchman was an elderly Irishman, and just</seg><seg type="columnLine">the type one would expect to find at the job. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was stubborn to begin with and refused to talk at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. It was the merest chance that Dan addressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me by my surname, and at that the old boy's atti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude changed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are ye Mr. Boon, the flyn' man?" he asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's me," I admitted, "unless there's anotker</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the name."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But are ye the Mr. Boon that has the works out</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the top end av Long Island?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, ye've got a son av mine w'orkin' for ye--</seg><seg type="columnLine">name av McGinty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "McGinty your son?" said I.

"He swears by you, so he does."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that, everything was easy. The old man ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted that he'd fallen asleep about one o'clock in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning, but that he didn't understand how it</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. We pointed out to him that it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">better to confess to having fallen asleep, rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than leave the idea that he was in league with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang that had emptied the tank. He then said he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been sound asleep between one and three in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. We questioned him closely, and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have little doubt that he was victim to the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">dope that had put Wall Street to sleep. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not heard of the bank robberies. We left old</seg><seg type="columnLine">McGinty with the assurance that he was not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame in any way, and that there was every pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect of speedy release if only he'd be frank to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioning of the detectives in charge of the case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Theories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">iniAN and I spoke to the officer in charge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">district, anil got a promise from him that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would put the idea to the investigator who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter in hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's just as well that you've got that out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man," said the police officer. "It seems to me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that we're on the way to saving two of our best</seg><seg type="columnLine">men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How's that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll have heard that Schomberg's Stores</seg><seg type="columnLine">were broken into about two this morning?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. To find out what we can about that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of our business over here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you can hardly call the affair a robbery."</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inspector said, "what with money being left</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cover the loss and damage to the Stores. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">how the place was broken into without the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicity of at least two of our patrolmen, we don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, and we didn't like the idea. After the news</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out about the Wall Street affair, these two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men came back with a confession that they'd been</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep, but we had a suspicion that they had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized on the chance to clear themselves. It did</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem a bit far-fetched that the gang that doped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the folk around Wall Street, and got away with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the haul, would bother to raid a New Jersey provi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion store and leave money to pay for what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">took. But if the old man didn't know about Wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street, before he admitted he'd fallen asleep, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances are that he's telling the truth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There was no watchman at Schomberg's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stores ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, the place is shut up at night--nobody left</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the premises."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Could we see two patrolmen in question?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Dan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Easy," said the inspector.

They had concealed the fact of having fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep in fear of losing their jobs, and it was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the news of Wall Street that had given them the</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage to tell the truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dan and I had heard as much as we needed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as we drove to the Cortlandt Street Ferry at</seg><seg type="columnLine">an easy pace, my scientific friend weighed the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They do connect up, Jimmy," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sure they do," I agreed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They link up, so far, only through the use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the anaesthetic," he went on. "But I can find no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sane connection in the things stolen. Two and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half millions in gold, a hundred kilos of provisions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and five thousand litres of gasoline.

I don't favour that sort of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flying at all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When we arrived at Dan's laboratory, he went</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">off to see his research merchants who had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">working on the tarnished gold. I didn't go with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him, being on the phone to Dick Schuyler. I was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lucky enough to find my man at home with his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">squadron, and he fell in with the idea of joining</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the party at Hazeldene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd like to come across on your new bus,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy," he said, "but I'm on duty again at five</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the morning. I'll fly over on my own bus if you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">can berth her for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tons of room, Dick," I told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When do you start for Hazeldene?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At seven from the Battery stage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right," said he. "I'll start with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well, old son," I said. "We'll wait for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you at the other end."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard a splutter come over the phone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, what the devil do you mean by that,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy Boon?" Dick demanded. "I have to inform</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you that my bus is the quickest thing in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">service."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can she do five hundred per?" I asked casually.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good Lord!" he yelled. "Can the Merlin?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Start at seven and see for yourself," said I, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rung off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dan came back just then, but had no discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">to report.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My fellows are in the air," he said. "That locket</seg><seg type="columnLine">and coin of yours have got them going. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to be the faintest trace of a radio-activity</seg><seg type="columnLine">filming the gold, but they have not determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it is yet. I've indicated new tests, and they'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">work late on them. The thing's a puzzle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went off to pack a kit-bag, and while I waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">I fan through some newspapers we had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the way up town. The columns were crammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with talk of the robbery, and it was evident that</seg><seg type="columnLine">business was badly jolted. Every paper spoke of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "panic" on Wall Street, of the run on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches of the banks, and none of them could</seg><seg type="columnLine">make head or tail of the radium mystery. Since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passing of the Personal Liberty Laws, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">restored to Americans the right, among other things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drink when and where they liked, and what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they liked, the newspapers had not shown such</seg><seg type="columnLine">scare lines. But in all the mass of written stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was not a single helpful word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The phone buzzer went, and I found my father</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the other end of the wire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ready For Business</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"C'AY--is that you, Jimmy?

There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something in the casual way he had proposed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip, a certainty of my straight answer, that made</seg><seg type="columnLine">me feel good and chesty. I'm sure if I had said</seg><seg type="columnLine">no, he'd have taken it as casually.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The feeling had not worn off when Dan Lamont</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back with a small kit-bag in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the smug contentment for, Jimmy?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. "Have you just heard that the President lias</seg><seg type="columnLine">resigned and that you've been offered the job?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told him, and his eyes lightened up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ARK OF THE COVENANT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">25</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, Jimmy," he pleaded, like any kid, "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming with you, old man--you're taking me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, aren't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It means starting about three in the morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That doesn't matter, Jimmy.

Dan Lament's an</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful kid in some ways, for all his high position</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the scientific world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We drove down to the Battery in good time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited to see the Merlin come in. Dan's man drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roadster away, and presently my father arrived.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick Schuyler had his seaplane moored a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">way along, and he waved his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a little time I spotted my bus like a dot in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clouds, as Milliken came speeding across</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brooklyn, before turning north into the Upper Bay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was flying good and high, and to an outsider</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be overshooting the point for making a</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe angle. I took a look out of the corner of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye at Dickie Schuyler, and he was standing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cockpit of his boat, yelling to attract my</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter, Dickie?" I veiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That your boat?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That fellow's going to crash her--too steep an</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> i waved my hand serenely, and he dropped back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his seat to watch, open-mouthed. I fancy he</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected to see Milliken turn back or spiral to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right height for planing into the landing-place, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stood up to watch again when the Merlin began</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hovering flight down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My father touched my arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's something new, Jimmy?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two years' work in that, dad," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He just patted me on the shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Merlin touched the water about twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards out, and taxied slowly up to the jetty. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing-stage crew turned her, and we all got</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard, Milliken giving up the pilot seat to me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved my hand to Dickie Schuyler to show that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ready, and we both took off together. In that</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular flight we didn't go much above four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred kilometres per, but we left the police boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">well behind. In fact, the Merlin was berthed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were all on the jetty waiting when Dickie</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've got some bus, Jimmy," was all he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that time--but he had a lot to say later on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This projected trip out to the Purnassic knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">my idea, of making Milliken one of the council of</seg><seg type="columnLine">war, clean on the head. I might have trusted an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other of my fellows to go over the Merlin prepara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory to the flight, but I knew that Milliken would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not let anyone else do it. An extra gasoline tank</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to be shipped and fixed with new connections,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the job wanted a sure hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Milliken promised that everything would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready by three o'clock, and picked out a squad of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the more skilled mechanics to do the work. He took</seg><seg type="columnLine">it for granted that he would come with me on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">(light, and I knew that it would be useless to argue</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him, but he agreed to take a bit of sleep when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the job of fixing the extra tank was well in hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So I had to leave it at that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had to let Dick Schuyler get off his opinions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Merlin at dinner before we could fall to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussing the robberies seriously. And I am afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the dinner was unduly prolonged before I satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied his curiosity by the aid of a whole thick pad</seg><seg type="columnLine">of scribbling paper. The funny thing was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither the banker nor the man of science seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be bored by the arguments. Dan and my father</seg><seg type="columnLine">were as keen as a mustard box.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When at length we had the Merlin thoroughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained, we were ready for coffee and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinks in the smoking room, and there Dan and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I put forward our theory of the robbery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Air Wins</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PINKERTON &amp; Co.," said Dick. "I'm pleased</seg><seg type="columnLine">to meet you. I often wondered who you were.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, well--so you're only you, after all!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you think it's feasible?" I demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, if you come to feasible--it's just feasible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Pinkerton--or are you the Co.?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wish you'd quit kidding, Dickie," I said. "Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you consider the notion reasonable?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Reasonable? Mr. Pinkerton, I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Danny and I both sat on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be good--I'll be very good!" he yelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently. "Shurrup, Jimmy! Stop it! I'll be good!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">We let him go, and after telling us that we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a couple of thugs, he became very sound on weights</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gases and hot air of that sort. He had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latest statistics about dirigibles at his finger-tips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think you may discount the Finn's blue-wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea. It would be very dangerous for a dirigible of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any size worth talking about to come down so</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the buildings. On a night like last night, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind there was, there would always be a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal of drift, and a dirigible is not the sort of thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can push away from a wall, as you do a ship's</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat from a quayside."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm inclined to agree with you," Dick went on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that the Wall Street robberies are linked up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gasoline and store affairs in Newark. The dope</seg><seg type="columnLine">links them up. But why drag in an airship to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain the possibility of the job being done by one</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang--to explain the need for the gasoline? I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see an airship dropping down on Newark and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">being spotted. You've worked out that one four-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand-kilo truck could handle the gold?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's right," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How far is the gasoline station from the bay</seg><seg type="columnLine">side?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not far, but it stands on a canal running into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Newark Bay."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That will do my business," Dick said trium-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phantly. "Suppose we just put a jolly old motor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship--not big--say about twenty tons--alongside</seg><seg type="columnLine">our nice little gasoline station. On land, we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">our four-thousand-kilo truck. The motor-ship drifts</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the gasoline station, and whangs in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dope--gas, or whatever it is, then proceeds to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pipe up to the tank. It takes its fuel. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meantime the gang with the truck is operating on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schomberg's Stores. When that is done, the truck</seg><seg type="columnLine">moves off across the Hudson by the Cortlandt</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street Ferry, which runs all night. It drops its</seg><seg type="columnLine">dope in Broadway and down Wall Street. The gang</seg><seg type="columnLine">bursts the banks and collects the goods, and off out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the district to a private wharf, say, on the Jersey</seg><seg type="columnLine">City side of Newark Bay, to where the jolly little</seg><seg type="columnLine">26</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">motor-ship has swum over.

But how do you get over the fact that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the automobile engines stopped in the doped</seg><seg type="columnLine">district?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ours is a special automobile ours is! Maybe it's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an electrically-driven truck-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It now appears," my father interposed, "that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street cars down Broadway were stopped below</seg><seg type="columnLine">Post Office Square, nobody knows how."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We all turned to stare at him, for we had almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten his presence, he was so silent. Dan was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first to recover.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That washes out your electric truck, Dickie,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can have your airship," Dick said. "When</seg><seg type="columnLine">you get crooks that can dope a whole district, stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobiles and electric cars, spread stickfast, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak, on all movement for two hours over an</seg><seg type="columnLine">area of a square kilometre--what's to prevent them</seg><seg type="columnLine">having an airship that can nestle down on Broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way? Have your airship--but do think tenderly of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my little motor-lugger. I was so fond of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you think of it, Mr. Boon?" Dan asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">my father.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think the difficulty of concentrating, and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting away undetected, points to an approach</seg><seg type="columnLine">from an unexpected quarter--so I say the air. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finn's dream is too exact to be alcohol. It's simple.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just a cabin coming down from the air--then a blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall--and some noises that to my layman ear sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncommonly like machinery. No alcohol dream that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So I say the air. Seems to me that whatever theory</seg><seg type="columnLine">you try to develop, you always get about half-way</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it. But I have a hunch that the solution will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be found in the air. Dick showed more surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Jimmy's new seaplane than over the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbery. Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because Jimmy has evolved a new principle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir," said Dick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Jimmy hasn't got the monopoly of brains</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the world. Maybe somebody's evolved a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">principle for dirigibles," said the old man. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to have one more drink. Then I'm going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed. And if for-once I may play the heavy father.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll advise you all to do the same. Seven hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">from now, Jimmy has got to be six hundred miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">out at sea."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So have I," said Dan Lamont proudly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We all had another drink, and the old man told</seg><seg type="columnLine">us exactly how he got on the long green in four</seg><seg type="columnLine">and holed out with a handsome putt for a five.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER FIVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Ghostly Ocean</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS three o'clock on the Tuesday morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Dan Lamont and myself were standing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the porch of Hazeldene with my father.

Well, so long!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We roared down to the sheds in quick time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the Merlin afloat and ready, shining like silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the arcs. Milliken had everything prepared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from extra wraps and food for the passengers, down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to easy chairs in the cabin, and the fixing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tank had been done in very workmanlike fashion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were good for three thousand kilometres.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We took off at three-fifteen, and I laid the course</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a point or two north of east, quickly bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Merlin up to a steady four hundred kilometres</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hour. It was reckoned that we should sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Parnassic at a point six hundred and fifty kilo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">metres east of Cape Cod, and two hundred and fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">south of Halifax, which gave us a thousand-odd</seg><seg type="columnLine">kilometres of an outward voyage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would have been easy that morning to fly by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stars, they were so clean and bright. Their light</seg><seg type="columnLine">was reflected in a dusky sheen off the sea below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To the north, the Great Dipper was poised on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of his handle. What clouds there were about</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the merest wisps, and there wasn't a trace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danny, wrapped as if for a journey to the North</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pole, sat at my side, a little behind where I was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pilot's seat, and he leaned forward in interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence to watch every move of my hands, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were shining with delight at his adventure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The murmur of the silenced engine came to us on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a beautiful liquid note which showed clearly how</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly Milliken and his men had done their</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. That excellent artificer sat on the floor at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danny's feet and leaned against the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin, his head cocked sideways to listen intently</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the voice of the engine. There was nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do, for the Merlin was flying like an angel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lights of steamer after steamer appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly on the skyline, neared, and passed under us</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of sight. On our port bow the coastwise lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">winked and glowed, until at last Nantucket fell far</seg><seg type="columnLine">astern, and in less than an hour's flying we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed to the south of Cape Cod. When the clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the control-board showed four-fifteen, I turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Milliken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let down the aerial," I said, "and see if we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick up the Parnassic."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was characteristic of the man that he knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">call and the wave length without having to ask,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was without any comment but a quick nod</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ARK OF THE COVENANT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">27</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that he lowered the aerial and fixed the receiver to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cars. In a minute the cabin was filled with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blatter of the radio.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"PNC! PNC! PNC!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> lie waited a little and repeated the call, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly switched to the open receiver of the radio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone. A strange voice issued from the box and</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's something the matter with the Parnassic's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wireless," said the voice, "gone phut, or something.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who's calling her, anyhow?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the seaplane Merlin," said Milliken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "British steamship, Maramba," the voice replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where are you?'' Milliken looked at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two hundred kilometres or so due east of Cape</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cod," I told him, and he repeated it into the trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looking for the Parnassic?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the notion," said Milliken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She should be somewhere round 43° north, 60°</seg><seg type="columnLine">west. I say, there's something the matter in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinking ocean this morning--ghostses or some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing--gives you the creeps. Well, cheerio, Merlin!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the English voice. "Is it cold up there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a bit of it, thanks," said Milliken. "Cheerio,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maramba!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cheerio and good luck!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Milliken looked to me for instructions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait fifteen minutes, Milliken, and try her</seg><seg type="columnLine">again,'.' I told him. He pulled up the aerial, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost without thinking what I was doing I opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throttle. The hand of the speed-dial went</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily round to four-fifty, as the Merlin lunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward with a keener note.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that glow that comes and goes on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon away to the left?" asked Danny, when fif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen minutes had elapsed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It must be the light on Cape Sable," I said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a look at the height register, which showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were three thousand odd metres above sea level.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"About a hundred and sixty kilometres away."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Milliken was letting down the aerial again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon the radio once more was spluttering its "PNC!</seg><seg type="columnLine">PNC! PNC!" But save for the steady song of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine, no sound greeted our ears. Milliken tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and again, without result. An uneasy feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">took hold of me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Haul in the aerial, Milliken," I said. "I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to let her go full out. Clamp the telephone re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiver to your ears, Dan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Milliken spun the drum round, and turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">help Dan with the cap-receivers, which would cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">out all noise except what could come through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone, and then he did the same for me. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were all fixed, I opened the cut-out, and gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Merlin full throttle. The dial hand jerked round</seg><seg type="columnLine">to five hundred kilometres and stayed put, for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the limit of its register--but I knew we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">going well over the five hundred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was now fifteen minutes to five, and a cold grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">had crept into the horizon ahead. Steadily, steadily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we sped into the dawn, the light paled into</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver and primrose, the floor of the sea passed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">dull blue into a living purple flecked with green</seg><seg type="columnLine">and silver. Minutes passed, the hand of the clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the control-board dragging heavily, and again I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that curious alertness of perception which I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">experienced on and after the flight of the day before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was more than alertness. It was an anticipation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of things that were about to happen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now, with the coming of the light, visibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">decreased as a haze began to grow over the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea. We dropped on a long angle to fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred metres. Here and there, the sea was dotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with steamers which, though visible to us, must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been out of sight of each other. These we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see were freighters and small liners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All three of us in the cabin of the Merlin were</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring ahead, expecting to sight the great mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Parnassic at any moment, for the time was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">well past five o'clock. As far as one could judge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were nearing the position where the liner could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be expected, but the haze below us was thickening</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly and, every minute, was lessening our range</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vision. Soon it would mean casting circles in</seg><seg type="columnLine">search.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Milliken touched me lightly on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder and pointed. Ahead of us, four masts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">three funnels pierced the mist. I throttled down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped into the silencer, then hovered down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a steep angle. We were over the ship in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's something the matter there, Mr. Boon,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Milliken. "There's no way on her, and she's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling broadside on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!" cried Dan Lament. "She has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Close Shave</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HpHERE was something terrifying in the helpless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the great liner. Broadside to the rollers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she lay sluggishly, swaying and veering amongst</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oily hummocks, and about her was the silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of death itself. Not a soul stirred on her decks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the thin wisp of steam that curled from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her smoke-stacks was the only thing about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">that moved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I know that my hands were shaking on the joy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick, and it was all I could do to master the sick</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling that was creeping over me. We circled</seg><seg type="columnLine">round her as slowly as we could, and coming as</seg><seg type="columnLine">close as we dared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look!" I said. "There are dead men lying on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bridge!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God in Heaven!" Dan Lamont cried, white to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lips. "What can have happened to them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I don't know," I muttered, "but we'll find out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I swung the Merlin closer still to the liner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you going to do, sir?" Milliken cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">apprehensively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am going to put the Merlin aboard her, if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll smash her, sir!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Maybe." I said madly, "but we're going aboard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't try it, sir! For God's sake, don't try it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut up, Milliken!" I said crossly--then realiz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that he wasn't thinking of his own skin, but of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his beloved Merlin, I grinned at him feebly. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right, Milliken. I won't do anything rash. Let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">reconnoitre."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was out of the question to try and bring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Merlin alongside the heaving freeboard of the liner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We would have had our wings smashed for a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainty. Nor was there space available to land on</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of the decks, cluttered as they were with ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tilators and deck-gear. The only likely place to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring her aboard was on what appeared to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">28</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">long stretch of canvas covering the promenade deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">astern, and it was a question if that would take her</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight. Fortunately, there was no cordage much</seg><seg type="columnLine">aft of the jiggermast, except for one stay coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the stern-post, and all halyards were reeved</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the mast. A ventilator or two pierced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">awning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though it was a terribly risky thing to attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the ship rolling as she did, it was the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance, and I told Milliken what I proposed to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, Mr. Boon," he said. "There's nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">else for it--if we are to get aboard. I don't blame</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What about you, Dan? It's a hundred to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll be smashed or spilled into the sea."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's all right, Jimmy. Go ahead with it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll get down on the floats, Mr. Boon," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Milliken; "might be handy to brace her if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">topples."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fetched out a length of rope and cut it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two, then, taking off his coat, he slid through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatch to the port-side float.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was depending on the Merlin's power of hover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to pull the thing off, so I took her up a bit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side astern of the ship, gauging the distance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">miss that after-stay. The ship, rolling horridly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up to meet us. We were over the awning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then it veered from under us--I thought we'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed it, when--back it swung--slowly. I flicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rudder round to bring us into line with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge of the awning. We landed with a grinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">shudder, then heeled sideways as if we'd never right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had quite made up my mind that we were going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to crash over on our back in the sea below--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a sickening moment or two of suspense we</seg><seg type="columnLine">righted!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dan, flat on the floor, with his head poked out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hatch, let out a yell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By Christopher, Jimmy!" he shouted. "Did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Milliken! Oh, you Milliken!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Milliken who had saved us. Lying on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">float, he had seized hold of one of the ventilators</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we settled, and, with those amazingly powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms of his outstretched, had braced us as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">toppled, otherwise we would have crashed over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board. Few men living could have done it. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">I got down on top of the awning, my mechanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">was composedly tying one of the float struts to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventilator, and a very white face was all he showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the superhuman effort he had put out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not much damage done, Mr. Boon," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly. "Except that the starboard float has sprung</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit, I think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good for you, Milliken," was all the thanks</seg><seg type="columnLine">I dared give him for saving our lives. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped us from going overboard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Luckily for us, the canvas of the awning was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched over stout boards, strongly supported, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">these were sufficient to take the weight of the sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane. Milliken lashed the opposite strut to another</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventilator, and we all climbed down to the deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ship still was held by that awful silence, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken save for the lap-lapping of the sea about her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I fancy all three of us were gripped by a sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of overwhelming awe as we went down the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panionwav, making for the gangway swung across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the after-well, From the gangway we saw, down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">below us, a number of seamen sprawled inertly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scuppers and about the hatch. We called down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them, but they did not stir, and our voices, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally thin, came back to us in eery echoes from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open hold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's take the bridge first," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">All Asleep</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">E ran up the ladders to the lower bridge, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the chart-room we saw an officer lying on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor in a heap. Dan went into the chart-room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Milliken followed me to the upper bridge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here we found two officers huddled behind the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas dodger, and in the wheelhouse behind, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">seamen lay together, one of them face downwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his arm rove through a quadrant of the wheel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was as if the ship had been struck by a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">plague. I don't know how Milliken felt about it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his ugly old face was a mask of stolid calm, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">shivers were running up and down my spine. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">kneeled beside the officer next to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's breathing, Milliken!" I cried, and I gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook the supine figure by the shoulders, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sigh the man only settled back more closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the rails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Try the other man," I told Milliken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My mechanic stepped over, and gently raised the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer--he was the chief--into a sitting position</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his knee. The man opened his eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinked at us, then with amazing suddenness was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide awake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the hell?" he said, and staggered to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. "Who are you? What are you doing on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge? Get off the brid--" His gaze fell on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother officer. "Here! What have you been doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Barr? You've killed him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a huge man, and he made a move</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards me with a look that was not very pleasant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't be silly," I said, as quietly as I might.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's asleep--the same as you have been."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's the matter with the ship? God! She's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">adrift! What-" He stared at us, and passed his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hand over his head. "Lord! I remember now--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was dark then--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meantime Milliken had managed to waken the</seg><seg type="columnLine">younger man, and just then Dan came up the ladder</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the officer who had been lying on the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the chart-room. Only by his braided cap could</seg><seg type="columnLine">one tell he was the captain, for he was in pyjamas</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a thick blanket-coat over them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter, Mr. Boscence?" he demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly. "It is two hours since we hove to--just</seg><seg type="columnLine">before six bells in the middle watch--I've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep--or unconscious. This gentleman--what has</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to th.' ship?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't rightly know, sir," the chief said, passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand over his head bewilderedly. "There's some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing queer here-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The captain stuck out his white torpedo beard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Get some way on the ship. Ring down--" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled round to the wheelhouse as he spoke, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke off. "For the love of God--look at the steers-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men! What's come over the ship?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded to Milliken, who ran into the caboose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and woke the seamen quite easily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dan looked at me in a dazed sort of way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Jimmy!" he gasped. "It's Wall Street all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">again!

I must say you</seg><seg type="columnLine">put a fair case, which is considerably strengthened</seg><seg type="columnLine">by this act of piracy. Whatever may be the mode of</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation, we are certainly faced by a remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">organization. But I should not, if I were you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weatherly, dismiss the possibility of the gold still</seg><seg type="columnLine">remaining on the ship.

The few reporters and other curious humans</seg><seg type="columnLine">that found their way out through the wilderness to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plant were sent on the wrong trail by the report</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we were about to test out special iron mining</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery and make borings for other minerals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While our electricians under the able direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a little red-headed Scotchman named McCann</seg><seg type="columnLine">were familiar with all the workings of the intricate</seg><seg type="columnLine">marhinerv. motors, transformers and so on, no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">ISLANDS IN THE AIK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">understood the complete working principle save the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor himself, although McCann, being canny</seg><seg type="columnLine">and deep, I credited with understanding more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">he let on. Certain it is that the professor was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">love with him and trusted him implicitly. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor was everywhere, tireless, secretive and</seg><seg type="columnLine">often provoking. Sometimes he worked far into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night when all others had sought their beds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for myself I wandered about from one section</seg><seg type="columnLine">to another in a maze of doubt and wonder. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole thing was too deep for me, and I thought so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much on the subject that it began to rob me of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my sleep. Besides, the Professor's taciturnity final-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly began to irritate me. Although I was furnishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the money he did not offer to divulge the inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">secrets of his scheme. My wonder was intensified</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the sky islands, two in number and located one</seg><seg type="columnLine">near each end of the enclosure, began to take form.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These islands were fashioned out of structural steel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were square in form and about one hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">from rim to rim. Although their superstructure was</seg><seg type="columnLine">built of light-weight materials, each must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighed many thousands of tons burdened as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were with machinery of many kinds--oscillators,</seg><seg type="columnLine">condensers, motors and divers other machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose names and offices were known only to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Besides the machines on the islands, others were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheltered by small buildings on the ground. At three</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners of each island were short mastheads with</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful lights and at the fourth rose a taller mast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head bearing a revolving airplane beacon. I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Professor proposed to raise this great mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air by wireless control, to suspend it there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and raise and lower it at will. Having had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory dinned into my ears for many days I natural-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly absorbed some of the faith of its inventor, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the work progressed I began to have misgivings</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to fear that, after all, his mind was unbalanced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course the public was not admitted to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grounds. I began to suspect that many doubted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the iron machinery story, for several reporters and</seg><seg type="columnLine">photographers finally came to visit us and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned away with a sharp rebuke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of our first tasks consisted of clearing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing field, after which Greta always brought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor and me over in her plane--a remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine in its way. Although she did not under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand these air islands any more than I. she criti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cized the Professor for evolving them and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sceptical of their success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We heard and saw little of Van Beck, but Greta</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw him often--as I afterward learned. Then one</seg><seg type="columnLine">day she swooped down suddenly out of the sky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed from the cabin of the plane and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed by Van Beck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Stiener glared, but Van Beck grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">amiably through his black, bushy beard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir, you must know that you are not wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">here," fumed the Professor. He turned savagely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greta. "What is the meaning of this, Greta?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why Professor Van Beck is an old friend." she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said innocently. "I just landed here without think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. I beg your pardon, Gustave. We will be going."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Greta made for the plane. Just then McCann ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with a blue print and asked the Professor a</seg><seg type="columnLine">question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly, certainly," chimed in Van Beck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"We do not wish to trespass."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor had been poring over a large blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">print spread open in the sun when he rose to rebuke</seg><seg type="columnLine">his Dutch friend. Now he walked away with</seg><seg type="columnLine">McCann and 1 followed. We were absent but a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, and when we turned back instead of seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Van Beck getting into the plane I observed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning away from the blue print and I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw him hastily thrust a black object into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">capacious pocket of his long black duster. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no workmen near at the time and as I had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">witnesses and could not be sure I resolved to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing about it. Smiling graciously Van Beck</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambled to the plane, took his seat by Greta's side</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were off with a wave of the hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Professor was furious over the unexpected</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is Greta thinking about?" he stormed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Has she no respect for her brother and his work?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Please God he didn't learn anything--but maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did," he added fearfully. "He has a devilish way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of learning things. What do you think?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I assured him I did not think it likely any of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">secrets had leaked out in so short a space of time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I was in no amiable mood. Van Beck seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be exercising an hypnotic influence over Greta</seg><seg type="columnLine">and 1 resented it bitterly. However, shortly after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward I had reason to be thankful for the episode</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the resultant lecture which the Professor gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greta. She was seen less often in Van Beck's</seg><seg type="columnLine">company and devoted herself closer to me and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of her eccentric brother. Nor did we see any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of Van Beck nosing around. He was seen but</seg><seg type="columnLine">little about town and seemed to keep pretty close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the class room. Near mid-summer we heard he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had obtained a vacation and had gone abroad for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Professor breathed a sigh of relief. We are</seg><seg type="columnLine">rid of him for a time," he said gratefully. "Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he returns the danger will be past."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Disappearance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEEK after week rolled away, the mellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">days of September were at hand and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">islands were nearing completion. Then one morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Professor and I stepped from the plane we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were met by McCann with the startling intelligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the office had been entered during the night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a cursory examination had revealed nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Professor stared blankly a moment, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed away to the office. We followed breathlessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The outer door had been forced, its lock being</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken, but beyond this no damage had been done</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far as we could discover. Anxiously we ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the papers--not a print was missing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing gone," said the Professor. "Yet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place has been entered. What for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps the thief was frightened away before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could grab anything," I suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't see how he got in," said McCann. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made sure that every guard was at his post</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout the night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hold you personally responsible, McCann,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the Professor severely. "See that it doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen again." And with that he turned and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">away leaving McCann with a crestfallen air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt sorry for the Scotchman. He seemed dp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voted to the Professor, and I. believed the rebuke</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be undeserved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">36</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ridge which the Professor had selected for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his daring experiment was the center of an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken wilderness far remote from any human</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitation. It was fifty miles from the university,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was a land of no roads and but few dim trails.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ridge dropped away to the north and to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">south in a series of valleys heavily clothed in virgin</seg><seg type="columnLine">timber. It was admirably situated for a secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">enterprise. The vicinity was never visited save by</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunters, and this was not the hunting season. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the route of the mail planes was far to the north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One night not long after the forced entrance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office McCann disappeared. The chief electri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cian had called at his office as usual the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. He was not there. Nor could he be found</seg><seg type="columnLine">anywhere on the grounds. As it was against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rules for any one to leave the premises under any</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances, without a permit from the Professor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we stared in blank dismay. A careful search of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounding woods brought no clue. We followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a rumor that he had been seen in his car driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the city at daybreak, but we could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">verify it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Professor, wild with suspense, anxiety and</seg><seg type="columnLine">remorse for having criticised his faithful aid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rummaged among his papers and discovered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue prints covering secret parts of one of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant condensers were missing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scene that followed I will not attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">describe. The Professor lost his head. He raved</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a madman, condemning everybody, threatening</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody. He said he would give up the work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">commit suicide and be through with it all. But at</seg><seg type="columnLine">length he grew calm, asked my pardon for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outburst and ordered the work to go on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I simply can't believe that McCann is a traitor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob," said the Professor. "I'd stake my life on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">faithfulness. He may be ill. He may be wandering</seg><seg type="columnLine">about with an unbalanced mind. You know this</seg><seg type="columnLine">work always did affect him profoundly. He has a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great brain, and I really believe that he under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stands this work as well as I do. It is a pity if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has become unbalanced. But sane or not I fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">his absence means trouble for us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The revelations of the next few days seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">justify the Professor's alarm. The press of the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried big black headlines announcing that Profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor Stiener, the great German scientist, was at work</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a theory calculated to upset one of nature's</seg><seg type="columnLine">laws. The exact nature of the scheme was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">known, but it was said to portend a mighty revolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in air travel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Professor read the news and smiled grimly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was pleased by the compliment, yet fearful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the public's premature praise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was about the middle of October when one</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning the Professor and I, walking along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street near the university campus, suddenly came</seg><seg type="columnLine">face to face with Van Beck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear old pal," said the Dutchman, taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Professor's hand which had not been offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and squeezing it cordially. "I have just returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a visit to my old home across the sea. Yes,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went on eagerly without waiting for the ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, "I had a fine time--a very fine time." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor smiled sourly. "And now may I ask how</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are coming on with your--that is--er--this</seg><seg type="columnLine">new scheme of yours?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Professor frowned. "I remember your un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">invited visit, Van Beck," he said icily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Beg pardon, Professor Stiener. Greta took me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that wilderness retreat. It was a mere accident</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my part, I assure you. But now that I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">something tremendous is being evolved by your</seg><seg type="columnLine">great brain I naturally am anxious over it and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish you well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks, Van Beck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Often you and I have worked together and to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether have reaped the reward."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean you have reaped it," rasped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You wrong me," remonstrated Van Beck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't want your help, Van Beck. My good</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend here, Bob Bookman, is furnishing the funds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To be sure, to be sure," cut in Van Beck pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">antly. "I am glad for your sake and for Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bookman's sake. It is a rare privilege to aid in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any work of yours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are busy," said the Professor ignoring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">compliment. "You must excuse us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly, Professor Stiener. But if at any time</seg><seg type="columnLine">you feel the need of assistance you know you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">count on me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damn that infernal Dutchman," said the Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor as we walked on. "He has a great mind, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful mind, but he is a rogue. And yet," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">added reflectively, "he has served me in the past</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he also has beaten me. I despise him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">still like him. But I wish he'd let me alone now,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he finished irritably.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was a vain hope, for during the next few</seg><seg type="columnLine">days Van Beck crossed the Professor's path fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently, became more insistent, more diplomatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his search for information, taking the Professor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rebuffs with a smile and maintaining an air of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">utmost friendliness. And at length he wormed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main secret from the Professor--the momentous</seg><seg type="columnLine">admission that the latter was striving to overcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laws of gravitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Into the Air!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS not long afterward that the loca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of our plant became known to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">public. A strange plane, flying low, circled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field and took its own time getting away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">People eagerly responded to its news. During the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next week automobiles by the thousand braved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocky trails leading to the plant, and folks by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hundreds peered curiously through the wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence at the manifold and mysterious preparations</seg><seg type="columnLine">to harness nature's mighty forces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The newspapers of the entire country teemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with conjectures and declarations as wild and fan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tastic as the Professor's scheme itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Airplanes began to circle and maneuver above us</seg><seg type="columnLine">during every hour of the day and night. But we</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread canvasses over the most important machin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery where the men worked unobserved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the fifteenth of November everything was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last complete. I shall never forget the day, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy delight of the Professor as he went about</seg><seg type="columnLine">testing the intricate machines, the air of awe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery that kept the workmen silent, and my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder, enthusiasm and yet doubt that the experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment would succeed. Thus far the project had cost</seg><seg type="columnLine">ISLANDS IN THE AIR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">37</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">me a mint of money which I did not begrudge, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing only proved a success. But how could</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a thing succeed?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I roamed about over the great artificial island,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking over the wonderful oscillators, condensers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">transformers, and so on. I knew their office but</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaguely, knowing only that they transmitted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power to operate the gravity deflector. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">number and size were bewildering surrounded as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were by divers other machinery whose nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not guess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At each corner and in its center the island rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a solid copper pier ten feet in height and about</seg><seg type="columnLine">a foot in diameter, and at the points of contact on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island itself were magnet-like apparatus. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground near each pier was a dynamo whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">current was supplied by a central power-house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were also many amplifiers and projectors of</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar construction. The whole fabric beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">my feet with its network of wires and steel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery was so heavy that the idea of projecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">it into the sky and holding it there suspended like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great captive balloon without the aid of gas or</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifting wings appalled me. Only my faith in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor's uncanny power made me hope it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not a plane was to be seen in the sky save</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greta's which kept diving and circling far above us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was still too early for the curious crowds</seg><seg type="columnLine">from town. Except the workmen, the Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and myself there was not a soul in sight. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor confided to me that he was glad we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. I understood. If the thing should fail he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would save himself from the ridicule of the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When all was in readiness the Professor, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">very grave and a little pale, beckoned to me silently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I followed him up the ladder on board the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island. He had just been over the whole thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly and had given last minute instructions</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his engineers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If anything happens, Bob," he said quietly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Greta will pick us up with the plane. But I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">look for anything untoward to happen," he added</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We paused near the center of the island. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor gave a final look around and over this</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous child of his brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God, how I wish McCann were here to share</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glory with us," he said sadly. "Poor McCann,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some dire tragedy must have overtaken him. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would give anything now to recall my harsh</seg><seg type="columnLine">words."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he put a whistle to his lips and blew shrilly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the fraction of a second nothing happened, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fabric beneath us trembled. There was a hiss,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sputter, an upward flash of fire, a shower of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparks through the frame-work, a drone of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamos, like the hum of a million bees, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to move. Slowly, almost imperceptibly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, then we shot upward with sickening sudden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. Up, up we went on a level keel. I felt but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slight tremor and only the rush of air proclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we were rushing heavenward with terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Professor grabbed me and hugged me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a frenzy of joy, for the time being too much over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to speak. And all I could do was to stare</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him in speechless wonder. Suddenly he drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and touched a button on the corner mast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly our motion was arrested. The island</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocked gently a few times, then came to rest with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a jar. The altimeter showed us to be up one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet. Looking down through the steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">work I saw the workmen staring up at us. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">we rode in the air as steady as a duck on a mill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pond, sustained by the invisible force of gravitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Greta landed her plane, rushed up and embraced</seg><seg type="columnLine">her brother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Gustave," she cried, "I did not think you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do it--I am so sorry that I ever doubted you;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I--" She paused as she looked away a dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow in her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind," said the Professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Bob, isn't this wonderful?" she said turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is more than that. At a time like this, words</seg><seg type="columnLine">fail us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am wondering whether I dare try a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunt," said the Professor. "And do you folks know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we could go 011 up to the moon if we wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to?" he added mysteriously. "But enough for to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. We will return to the earth. I see other and</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater marvels just ahead of us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the girl and I gazed in awe at this remark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able man he manipulated the machinery again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we descended slowly and easily landing exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the points of the piers. The workmen clustered</seg><seg type="columnLine">around their employer showering him with con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratulations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Professor Triumphant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ELL, that night I couldn't sleep for thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that wonderful exploit and the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Professor hinted at other wonders hidden up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sleeve. Would man ultimately conquer all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laws of the universe? Was there no limit to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">power? Preposterous as it seemed I answered these</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing questions in the affirmative. Fulfilling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scriptures, man was to become as gods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now the Professor, athrill with triumph and</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthused over the future outlook of his aerial</seg><seg type="columnLine">islands, invited everybody to come out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilderness and witness man's latest conquest over</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day was set and widely advertised. Scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tists from all over America were tendered special</seg><seg type="columnLine">invitations, as well as many statesmen. The pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor sent Van Beck a messenger urging him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The whole nation was dumfounded by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">announcement, but almost every one treated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter as a huge hoax and questioned Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stiener's sanity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But they came by thousands--coming by plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">and automobile, on horseback and 011 foot. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods surrounding the high fence was black with</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. But, of course, no one was permitted in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the fence. Even Professor Van Beck, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to consider himself a special guest, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to peer through the fence and reach between</seg><seg type="columnLine">its wires to give the Professor the handclasp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">congratulation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear Professor," he said with an injured</seg><seg type="columnLine">air.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were partly lowered, then raised again alternately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot into the air until they appeared as small dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">specks in the blue sky. And finally they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed safely and noiselessly on their piers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Professor was wild with enthusiasm and joy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He bowed again and again as the milling crowds</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheered madly. Often he ran over to Van Beck</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he stood with his face pressed against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire and boasted of the complete success of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great venture. It was plain to be seen that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor was gloating over the Dutchman. At last</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had succeeded in making and utilizing a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery without his butting in. But Van Beck</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not stint his praise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I rejoice with you, my friend," he said heartily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Great wealth and endless fame arc yours. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous, marvelous--and it is just."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The immense crowd left reluctantly. Long after</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightfall knots of excited and awe-struck people</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingered about the refreshment stands and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">peering curiously through the fence discussing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracle which had taken place before their eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was a fly in the ointment of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor's happiness--he bitterly regretted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">McCann was not there to witness the climax of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Owing to the success of the demonstration and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that the press of the entire country had spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">its description far and wide, the Professor seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opportunity to launch a stock company to</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploit his invention whose scope and possibilities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he averred, were well nigh limitless. But he pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out that its initial work would be in the field of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the airplane. A line of his islands would be placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">along every plane route. Machines would refuel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make repairs in the air. In the air. the islands</seg><seg type="columnLine">would act as guideposts by day, and at night -their</seg><seg type="columnLine">beacons would flash out to cheer and guide the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aviators on their way. Should storms arise the</seg><seg type="columnLine">islands would be shot above the storm, and here in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a haven of refuge the plane could rest and make</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary adjustments and repairs if need be. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers could leave the cabin for a few minutes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk about and procure refreshments and many</seg><seg type="columnLine">luxuries right on the island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that is not all the wonders I have in mind,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the Professor with shining eyes as he unfolded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plan to me. "Think of an airplane without any</seg><seg type="columnLine">motive power. I am not thinking of gliders," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">added with a deprecatory wave of the hand. "I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking of an airplane sailing through the air with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out any motor or other visible means of locomotion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlled by power stations on earth which can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be fifty miles or more apart, through the medium</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my device located on the plane. The future</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, disabled in the air, will not fall like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plummet and crash, or have to glide down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a forced landing for repairs," he went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly. "It simply will radio to the nearest hangar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">island, a repair plane will then slip off through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, hitch to the nose of the disabled plane and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tow it to the island just the same as cripped autos</seg><seg type="columnLine">are now towed to a garage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accustomed as T was to listening to the wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful plans of my friend I could only sit and stare</seg><seg type="columnLine">dumbly over this new scheme. Where would that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty brain finally lead this man? And for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time I began to fear the final results of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. If he were able to perform such miracles</seg><seg type="columnLine">thej' might lead him on and on to new fields and</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumphs until grasping unseen and undreamed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces he might innocently usher in a planetary</seg><seg type="columnLine">catastrophe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Evil Premonitions</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE stock of our company--known as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stiener, Bookman Airways Inc.--took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">market by storm. In less than two weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">every share of both common and preferred was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sold, and had I not been in on the ground floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a large block of stock I would have considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had lost a great investment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although Van Beck, whenever we ran across</seg><seg type="columnLine">him--which was not often--continued to voice his</seg><seg type="columnLine">praise of the Professor's latest invention, he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">no stock in the company so far as we were able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn. Although the Professor made no complaint</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw that his pride was hurt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the next week we were head-over-heels</seg><seg type="columnLine">in work. What with perfecting the plans of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new organization and daily trips out to what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor termed the mother plant we often worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty hours at a stretch without rest. I had put</seg><seg type="columnLine">my whole soul in the venture, as well as most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my fortune, but the closer I became associated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Professor the more secretive and mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">he became. I thought I had earned the right to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know the innermost secrets of his plan which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to revolutionize the world, and Greta agreed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. At last I faced his reticence with open rebellion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tut, tut, my boy," he said soothingly. "Of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have a right to know and you shall know. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will explain all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When?" I demanded harshly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have patience. I have postponed my revelations</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you that 1 might give you other and greater sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prises. I will carry out other experiments soon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then I will make you master of all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you not realize that your delay to give me</seg><seg type="columnLine">all details might easily wreck the whole enterprise?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suppose you were to die--who would carry on?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Professor stroked his beard thoughtfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps you are right, my boy," he said at last.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Something might happen to me and then with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret unrevealed posterity would lose a priceless</seg><seg type="columnLine">heritage. Have the plane made ready, Greta." he</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued turning to his sister. "We will go out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plant, and then after I try out another idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine you shall know all, my bov, vou shall know</seg><seg type="columnLine">all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was athrill with joyous anticipation as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped from the plane beside one of the islands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soon the Professor would draw aside the veil and</seg><seg type="columnLine">allow me to view the pulsing heart of this marvel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then I confidently told myself I would ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">ISLANDS IN THE AIR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Greta the question which long I had wanted to ask.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But there was to be another delay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know whether it will work or not."</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly said the Professor as if to himself. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to act queer, jumping about from one thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to another muttering and shaking his head affirma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively. "Maybe I'll smash it" he said finally. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we shall see--we shall see. Come, my boy," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">added turning to me and eyeing me oddly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He led the way aboard the island, and Greta</seg><seg type="columnLine">soared into the air. In a few minutes we had risen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a height of two thousand feet. Then Greta gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">another exhibition of the unique braking system of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her plane by landing on the little field by our side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am going over to the other island," announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Professor. "I shall send it into the air and</seg><seg type="columnLine">maneuver it horizontally. I will even come over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to visit you, my boy. I shall step from that islaud</seg><seg type="columnLine">onto this one. But if anything should happen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me" he went on while I gazed at him in astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, "you must descend. Just pull this lever down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forward and press this--" He paused with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand on the lever and looked at me steadily. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I believe I'll have you meet me" he continued, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes burning and boring into mine. "It will make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the test complete. Come, Greta, let's be going."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned and clambered into the plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on--you have not told me how to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">you," I reminded unable to understand the sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">changes of his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind," he said. "I'll try out my island</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, then I'll send directions by Greta."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In another moment they had zoomed into the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving me alone aboard this strange contrivance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they winged away a sudden feeling of loneli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness assailed me not unmixed with misgivings. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes roved about me. I had but a vague knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mechanism of this craft. Its bewildering</seg><seg type="columnLine">array of wheels and levers and buttons appalled me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanks to the Professor's foolish procrastination in</seg><seg type="columnLine">teaching me their use. I wondered what would be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come of me, marooned here in the air should the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor crash and something happen to Greta.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew the island could not be lowered from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground by any one save the Professor. I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">below hopelessly. The workmen were only small</seg><seg type="columnLine">dots, and the buildings and equipment of the plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like toys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My attention was soon diverted to the Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his island. Majestically he rose into the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he was about on a level with me. Then I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him hurrying about over the structure, pausing now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then to oil and examine a machine, to adjust</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lever and try a valve. I took up the binoculars</seg><seg type="columnLine">and watched him closely. I saw that he was nervous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the expression on his face alarmed me. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks were pale, his eyes glowing like red coals</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the motions of his lips told me he was talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly to himself. I feared that the dreaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment long feared by Greta had come at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then as I gazed I saw about half a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the Professor something moving among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees. Autumn was tardy in coming and most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the timber among the evergreens still retained its</seg><seg type="columnLine">foliage though it was splashed with gold. As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the tops of the timber seemed to expand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to become strangely animated. Then they appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be rising to meet the sky as though they had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly taken on a phenomenal growth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I blinked, lowered the glasses and hastily wiped</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with my handkerchief. But as I placed them</seg><seg type="columnLine">again to my eyes I uttered a cry of amazement</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stupefaction, for soaring above the tree tops</seg><seg type="columnLine">was another island of the s\y! And this island carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees and shrubs on its bosom. There was grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">there and flowers. At each corner and in the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">were airplane beacons the same as ours, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of a brilliant hue and artistic design.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Catastrophe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T rubbed my eyes with a trembling hand. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">•W- had come over me to cause this hallucination?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had thought so much about this sky island busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, had lost so much sleep over it that the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was getting the best of my reason. I surely was</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing things. That green island over there soaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the blue was a mirage, a fantasy of a disordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain. I resolved to get a grip on myself and quit</seg><seg type="columnLine">this business before it was too late. But as I stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">again the mirage persisted mockingly, grew plainer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finally ceased its upward flight and came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest. It was then that I suddenly discerned a figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">bobbing about near the corner masthead--a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with a bristling black beard. I caught my</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath with a gasp. My God, I was beholding no</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirage but the devilish handiwork of Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stiener's rival--Van Beck!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With sickening force the hot truth surged over</seg><seg type="columnLine">me--Van Beck had stolen a march on us, after all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had photographed the blue print the day Greta</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed him in her plane. He had broken into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office, and the report that he had gone abroad was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lie and a blind. He had stolen the Professor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret and improved it. True to form he was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rob the Professor of the fruits of victory. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was unthinkable but there was the evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">before my eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now as I looked closer I saw another man</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the green island. His back was toward me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was crouched over some sort of a machine. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be working over Van Beck's directions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I saw the latter run up to him every little while</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gesticulate excitedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this time the Professor was still running</seg><seg type="columnLine">about making everything secure for his coming test.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last he paused and looked around with an air</seg><seg type="columnLine">of satisfaction. All was ready. And then I ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served him suddenly catch sight of his sky neighbor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw his face grow white as chalk, and he stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment rigid as a statue. Then he placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hand to his head in a dazed sort of way. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw him stagger forward, grip a large lever and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast his eyes in my direction. I thought he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to try out the lateral act, to come over to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and discuss Van Beck's startling appearance in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">field. In another moment I saw that his island was</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed moving laterally, but not in my direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was rushing toward Van Bec\!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Overhead Greta was soaring and dipping and</seg><seg type="columnLine">circling gracefully. I believed that she had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">witnessed the advent of Van Beck and h's island.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew she was keeping an eye on her brother;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she would swoop down and rescue him should</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything go wrong. It was evident that the Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor was about to board his rival and demand</seg><seg type="columnLine">an explanation. In the present state of his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">I feared a battle between the two scientific gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">40</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">iuses--a battle that would bring death and ruin to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our cause. Then I saw that Van Beck's island was</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving--that he was coming on to meet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God, they have both gone crazy!" I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed aloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so it seemed. Even through the glasses I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see that they were rushing along at tremen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dous speed, but as they drew near each other Van</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beck gave evidence that he did not wish to commit</seg><seg type="columnLine">suicide, did not wish to fight. Evidently he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">but seeking to show the Professor that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal and duplicate any feat of his. He raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">island, only to be followed swiftly by the angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor. Van Beck shot down lower, and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Professor followed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time Greta was flying low above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor, and by her gestures and the agonized</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression on her face I understood that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">imploring him to check his onward flight, to back</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from his foe and seek safety on the plane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the Professor waved her back with a horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimace and turned his blazing eyes toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancing island of green. It was plain that he in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended to smash the creation of his rival even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he himself should perish in the wreckage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Embittered by years of Van Beck's meddling in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs he would kill him and wipe out the disgrace</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the altar of death. 1 could do nothing to save</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. In my excitement I ran to the very edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my island, shouted and waved my arms frantically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then as I gazed in the dumb agony of despair</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw that Van Beck was striving desperately to</seg><seg type="columnLine">avert the catastrophe. He and his companion were</seg><seg type="columnLine">working madly with the machinery, but somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island's momentum could not be checked. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery had gotten beyond their control, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">maddened Professor was coming resistlessly on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Edge to edge they met. The detonation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">deafening. Blue and green and yellow fire enmeshed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them for a moment, then the great mass rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shut my eyes and reeled backward faint with</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror. I heard an awful crash as they struck. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked over the side and as the dust cleared away</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the trees, many of which had impaled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling structures, I saw the ruins of the islands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Greta was flying wildly about above the ruin</seg><seg type="columnLine">vainly seeking a place to land. Once I saw' the wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the plane become entangled in a tree top. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had difficulty clearing it, and I thought she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to crash. I must rush to her aid. I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurry down. But how?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gazed about me in dismay. The Professor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">delayed the vital information too long. But in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild anxiety over Greta and the fate of her brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must attempt the descent. I went up to the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">masthead and studied the instrument board care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. After a time I believed that I understood the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowering mechanism, I seized the lever which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor had indicated. I swung it over and pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it downward. I pressed a button. And then--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was I moving? At first it was uncertain. I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at the earth. The workmen within the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closure were running wildly about, waving their</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms and staring upward. It was then I realized I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was moving. But, God in heaven, I was mounting</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frantically I ran here and there, pulling levers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling wheels, but steadily, mercilessly, noise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly 1 rose into the sky. The great bulk beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">my feet was steady as a house floor. Nothing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did affected it in any way. It was as if some</seg><seg type="columnLine">great power from above had reached down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pulling me into the heart of the universe. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered why some of the electricians on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground did not notice my predicament and shut off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power, then remembered that they did not dare</seg><seg type="columnLine">to, the Professor having failed to instruct them</seg><seg type="columnLine">what to do in such an emergency. Besides, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized their attention was centered on the wrecked</seg><seg type="columnLine">islands and the safety of Greta.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I speculated on how long the power to operate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the repellent device of the Professor's terrible ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines would last. Surely, I reasoned, I must soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass beyond their influence. But then would I fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently back or would the gravitational pull of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth assert its rights and suck me down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wanderer Through Space</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TFVEN as these alarming thoughts drummed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">my brain I realized that I was rising faster and</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster. The altimeter soon registered ten thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, and the air was icy cold, I shivered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">buttoned my coat about me. Then came more alarm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing thoughts. Suppose that these gravity waves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the devilish ingenuity of the Professor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reversed, reached beyond the sun! Suppose that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this island should rush on and on until it should</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape those waves and come under the influence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sun or some other great star, or fall and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash upon the cold, dead moon? Or suppose it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be attracted to the surface of any of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">but would sail on and on through space--a lonely</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanderer of the sky!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again in a frenzy of desperation I made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounds of the machines. I bitterly reproached my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self for permitting the Professor to keep postponing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the instructions covering the manipulation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">islands. Now all was lost. Fortune, Greta--every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing sacrificed for a madman's dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fifteen thousand feet by the altimeter. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still rushing toward heaven like a rocket. My teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">were chattering and I was gasping for breath. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and feet were aching with the cold. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of drowsy subconsciousness I realized that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would soon succumb for the want of oxygen. Soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">this strange vehicle that was bearing me to destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion would become both my funeral car and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomb. Yet there was nothing I could do to save</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself. Then a strange peace settled upon my soul.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why should I worry? Was I not a distinguished</seg><seg type="columnLine">person? My death was to be the most unique ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">witnessed by the stars. I gazed up at the cold, blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky and laughed hysterically. What did I care? Bui</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as I gave myself up for lost and my brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew dull I was sensible that my speed--tremen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dous as it had been before--was even faster now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thin air swirled and whistled about my ears as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I fought for breath and my numb hands clutched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mast to keep from falling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I stood there swaying dizzily I felt a jar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somebody was calling my name--it sounded as</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a great distance--and there was Greta step-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping out of her plane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ISLANDS IN THE AIR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">41</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither spoke as she helped me into the cabin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I understood in a vague way how she had wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nessed my plight and followed me. Also as in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream came the thought that I had to thank the</seg><seg type="columnLine">genius of the Professor for constructing a plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of such a flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several minutes after we had left the island and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rapidly dropping toward the earth my senses</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to normal and looking up I saw the dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of the island still racing on into space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Landing at the plant we marshalled the work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, secured tools and set out afoot for the wreck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a weary tramp of an hour through the brush</seg><seg type="columnLine">and over the rocks we reached it. The ruin of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">islands was complete, and near where the edges</seg><seg type="columnLine">had met, interlocked and almost welded themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">together we found the lifeless forms of the Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessors within a few feet of each other. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">differences were settled at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poor old pal" I said sadly. I took Greta by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm and turned away just as the workmen gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the bodies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We inspected the other side of the green islands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">marveling over Van Beck's originality and artistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent. We were about to leave the spot when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a faint moan from above us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clambering up over the twisted steel we came</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a man pinned fast between two beams. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran to him, then started back in dismay, for it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">McCann. Exerting all our strength we released</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He was badly crushed but conscious. Here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said to myself, is the secret of Van Beck's know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge about the islands. McCann is a traitor, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, as I glanced at Greta reading agreement</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her eyes. But the injured man swept us with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a look of pleading as though he sensed what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing in our minds,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm no traitor, folks," he said weakly. "Van</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beck's men kidnapped me and kept me by force. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced me to tell all I know about the islands, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know much." The Scotchman smiled whimsically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you will tell us what you know," I said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a chance to save the priceless knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, aye, sir--if I can. But--" He put his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to his chest while a paroxysm of pain distorted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his features.

We must hasten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I poised my pencil above the paper the dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">man made a brave effort to go on, but it was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">use. He looked at us appealingly. His head sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and he was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The great secret has died with him," I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I am glad," she said.

The far-reaching beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped low to the east and west, with an upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">swing of thirty degrees as it traversed the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">and south, describing two giant arcs on the further-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most confines of the sky.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief pilot of the freighter had been unable to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm or to deny Alroyd's report, having been busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the, time with a refractory fuel pump.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tommy, Tillotson and Alroyd were driven to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether for mutual support in an effort to withstand</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy barrage of witticisms from the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilots during the first few days. Boyer was sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take advantage of every opportunity of poking</seg><seg type="columnLine">fun at the trio. As time went on they almost be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came convinced that the vagaries of the huge light</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been hallucinations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then without warning, and as if possessed by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil spirit, Number Seven beacon suddenly became</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curse to be known from one end of the Trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">continental lines to the other as a siren, malicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">and malevolent. Pilots who at first scoffed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">recurrent report, were soon forced to admit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">something was wrong, they knew not what. McCrea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">appealing for more and saner pilots, for electrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">experts to put the beacon in order and for scientists</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make tests of the light, bombarded the Pacific</seg><seg type="columnLine">office with a barrage of radiograms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It started again on a dark, moonless night when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the west bound passenger plane landed thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes late, after flying in a zig-zag course from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pass to Seven. The irate superintendent was</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting at the loading area when the pilot emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the cockpit.

Light from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oil flares on the hill crest now began to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflected from the swiftly whirling propellers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">polished metal nose cap. Flashlights were waved</seg><seg type="columnLine">madly by members of the salvage crew on the hill</seg><seg type="columnLine">top and then flicked off as the men sprang behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the concrete shoulder of the tower foundation, wail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for the inevitable crash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just when it seemed the hurtling mass was on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of striking the outmost flare on the southern</seg><seg type="columnLine">crest of the hill, the now dimly outlined shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">swerved upward.

The pilot was doing everything possible now</seg><seg type="columnLine">to save his ship, settling ever faster down the slope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hill under full power in an effort to gain</seg><seg type="columnLine">his minimum flying speed of sixty miles an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">and level off before striking the ground. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance allowed him was frightfully short. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">left wing still a trifle low the craft touched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground at a point just within the lighted boundary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounced into the air with crumpled landing gear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then settled forward and slowly nosed over in a fog</seg><seg type="columnLine">of illuminated dust particles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Promise From Boyer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ambulance and fire truck raced over the field</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the second time that night, shrieking their</seg><seg type="columnLine">way through the running spectators already mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the wreck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fateful beacon serenely traced its bright path</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the horizon, content now with dipping its</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam low over the second catastrophe of the night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then turning onward to the east as if beckoning</seg><seg type="columnLine">new victims to a like fate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eager hands tore open the emergency doors on</seg><seg type="columnLine">each side of the pilots' section.

In place of carrying useless</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight by loading on sufficient fuel for a non-stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight, the fuel tanks merely served from one air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port to the next, allowing the maximum of pay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">load. Plane crews were changed at each stop for</seg><seg type="columnLine">additional safety in operating the huge multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">motored crafts, as tests had shown the superiority</seg><seg type="columnLine">of using an air liner pilot at his point of best</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficiency, relieving him before he became aware of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatigue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Experts Take A Hand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">McCREA's urgent appeals for aid brought not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a corps of electrical and airport illumina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion experts from San Francisco during the morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but also brought a number of officials, several major</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock holders in the corporation, moving picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">news reel cameramen, and a horde of newspaper</seg><seg type="columnLine">reporters and photographers.

It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">not radio--it's magnetism.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreign nations could put thousands of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern planes in the air in a day's notice, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States was still making use of machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were antiquated survivors of the experimental</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage of flying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It must not be thought that Congress had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning of the dangers inherent in continually</seg><seg type="columnLine">slashing the appropriations for the Air Service.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again and again, in every way possible, the stud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ents of modern and future warfare thundered their</seg><seg type="columnLine">warnings. The political leaders of the nation paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more attention to their pleas than if they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buzzing of so many gnats. If the protesters be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came too annoying, those in power simply had their</seg><seg type="columnLine">annoyers removed from the service.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Consequently, the United States became the</seg><seg type="columnLine">richest, the best hated and the weakest nation in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world. Trusting in her position, with two</seg><seg type="columnLine">oceans, one east and one west, a peaceful friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the north, and a weak nation on the south, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Queen of the Western hemisphere felt that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing to fear. As a supreme proof of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country's ability to defend herself, the Pacifists</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed with pride to the fact that practically every</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation in the world was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in debt to her. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not realize the truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this condition was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as apt to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies of the debtor</seg><seg type="columnLine">nations as it was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Consequently, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Farrol arrived at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Washington with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">message of warning in</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard to a terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger that was threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening from Mexico, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found no one willing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen to him. His tale</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so fantastic, so im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible, that the of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cials, whom he talked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to, even in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">War Department,</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply dismissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as a harmless</seg><seg type="columnLine">fanatic. For three</seg><seg type="columnLine">days he wandered</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the Ca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitol, growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">more and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rebuffs that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being handed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, yet never</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully realizing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being looked upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a paranoic. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was making no headway, and took an evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">train to New York City. There as he was trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell his story to the Mayor he was arrested</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a suspicious character, probably insane, and spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">his first night in the city in a police station.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning, thanks to the fact that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept his mouth shut about the Mexican trouble, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was discharged for lack of evidence. Not a word of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arrest was placed in the papers, due to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolute unimportance in the eyes of the reporters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was therefore placed in a peculiar position; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great men of the nation had either refused to listen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, or, listening, had ridiculed him. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgusted with politics, and, at the same time, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrified as ever with the knowledge that the na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was in peril and that something had to be done.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After deep thought, he determined to see, if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could, the President of the Universal Electric Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That worthy, Jacob Strange by name, had risen</seg><seg type="columnLine">by sheer ability, from the position of office boy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">president.

"Mexico has formed a treaty with Japan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the object being the complete conquest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States. I suppose that when this end is ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complished, Japan will claim the states west of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rocky Mountains and Mexico some of the South</seg><seg type="columnLine">western states. They may even reduce the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States to the territory east of the Mississippi River</seg><seg type="columnLine">That point is a matter of unimportant detail. Japan</seg><seg type="columnLine">has to have a landing point. She needs Mexico as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a base. Mexico needs money and supplies. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan is this; to send a bombing fleet of planes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow every big city in the nation to splinters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While the country is recovering from this shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">and is wondering what it means, an invading army</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Japs and Mexicans will capture New Orleans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and St. Louis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By the time that our country is ready to fight, every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing west of the river will be conquered. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not going to declare war . . . they are simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">going ahead to destroy our cities over night. I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve that they are going to use as many as twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand bombing planes, each capable of carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over a ton of powerful explosives."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time the President of Universal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Electrics shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Each of those planes would require two men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That would mean 40,000 experienced pilots. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not that many in the whole world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I realize that, but these planes are not going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have pilots . . . not human ones."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you mean robots?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something like that. Perhaps you remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading about that small steam yacht that was sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to sea, swung around, and returned to the dock</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a pilot? The machinery on that boat was</seg><seg type="columnLine">governed from the shore by wireless waves; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steering, the rate at which the machinery worked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was finally and completely under the control of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man on shore, who operated at a switchboard. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain distance from shore, he shut off the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gine and the boat coasted back to the dock. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know that the Japs have perfected this radio con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol of a plane. Each of the planes has a gyroscope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Started at a certain height, pointed in a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction, those planes will go on at a definite speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The operators in Mexico can determine within a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes just when a plane will be over New</seg><seg type="columnLine">Orleans or St. Louis. At that minute they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">press a button which will release the ton of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosive. They do not care what happens to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane. The few thousands that it costs is a mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">trifle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It could all be done", finally answered Jacob</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strange. "That is, I mean that I could put my men</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work and perfect such an apparatus in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nection with a plane. Of course, that yacht was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">a toy. I think something like that was done with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobile too. The difference between guiding</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an auto and an airplane is probably simply a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of detail. But it would require a wonderful brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">to put a plan like that into operation. I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that the Japs had a man good enough to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent a wireless controlled plane."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They did not have. It is my invention. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">stole it from me three years ago. Perhaps you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not willing to believe that? You will have to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tried to sell the entire patent to the United States</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government and the people in Washington thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was a crank. I was mad, but not enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">try and sell it to a power like France or Germany,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I did think that I could interest one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small countries in Asia, like Afghanistan. So, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailed from San Francisco, intending to go to Japan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from there overland. They got me in Tokio; I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in a hospital for three months with a fractured</seg><seg type="columnLine">skull. By the time that I was able to ask questions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trail was cold. Nothing was taken out of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggage except my plans for the wireless control</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was destitute; so, I took the first job that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get, and that was in the Burns plant in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tokio. I suppose you know that the Burns people</seg><seg type="columnLine">assemble planes there for sale in eastern Asia? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant was making so many of them and selling so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many that I became suspicious; but, by that time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had learned to keep my mouth shut. What I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to know was who was buying all those planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and where they were going. They certainly were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not being used in Japan. I went to the American</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ambassador, and he laughed at me. No use telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">you about that, though. Then, after a hard time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found that these planes were all being shipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the country, some to Korea and some to</seg><seg type="columnLine">China. I got the names of some of these ships and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their destination. Going to those ports, 1 found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had never arrived. It did not take much</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasoning power to arrive at the conclusion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were going to a secret destination. Of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was taking my life in my hands, but I felt in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terested; so, I went on one of those ships as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stowaway. I finally landed on the Mexican coast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If I wanted to, I could write a story about that</seg><seg type="columnLine">voyage and sell it, but what's the use? No one</seg><seg type="columnLine">would believe me. There I was on the west coast</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mexico, at a port that had no name--desolate as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inferno and just as hot! I started out for the desert</seg><seg type="columnLine">and watched, and those planes, one by one, rose in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air and went like bees over the desert. Going</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere, see?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was accustomed by that time to being hungry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the only way to find where those planes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">going was to go after them. Fortunately, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not far. Fifty miles from the coast there was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty a flying field as you ever saw, in what seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be the bottom of an old volcano. It was sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by low mountains. There was not a breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">of air--and room on the sandy floor for thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand planes!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Farrol's Plan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T GOT up on top of one of those mountains,</seg><seg type="columnLine">-**- found a spring, made a rabbit trap, and, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how, lived for another three weeks. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of men down there, a regular little tent</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, but that was not what was interesting to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the stuff that they were doing in the air that</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first was so puzzling, but, of course, I soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BLOODLESS WAR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">55</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tumbled to it. A man would take one of those big</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes up in the air, about one thousand feet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he would come down in a parachute. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane would go on for a few miles, turn around</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then glide down to the ground. Sometimes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it was up in the air, a small package would</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop from the bottom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''After thinking over it for some days, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had happened. Those Japs had discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had an invention for the control of planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">by radio waves. That is why they nearly killed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Tokio. Now, they were assembling a great fleet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of planes in this isolated valley and learning how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to control them by my invention. And they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing it! Those little packages, that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping out of the planes were dummy explosives.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their release was provided for by my invention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ■'Someway, I managed to reach the border. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">starved and broke. I tried to get money ... no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one would listen to me. So, I started to go to work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saved my money, and, just as soon as I could,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went to Washington. All that they did to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was laugh at me. Then I went to New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tried to see the Mayor, and I was arrested as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a suspicious character. However, I managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make them believe that I was harmless, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they released me I came here. It is my idea that</seg><seg type="columnLine">those Japs are going to blow our cities into</seg><seg type="columnLine">eternity."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is just your idea?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No real dope to back the idea with?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing but common sense. What would they</seg><seg type="columnLine">want with twenty thousand planes? What would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the use of perfecting my pilotless plane and</seg><seg type="columnLine">practicing the electrical release of the bombs?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing commercial about that, is there? That</seg><seg type="columnLine">means war, and the only place to wage war, if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack us, is on the Mexican border."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe you are right," the President of Uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versal Electric finally said. "But I want to be sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you know what you are talking about. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot fool my experts. I am going to call three</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them in and you describe your invention to them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If they say that it is practical, we will see what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can do to save the nation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the next three hours John Farrol talked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">an audience of four men who probably knew more</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical electrical science than any other four men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the United States. At the end of that time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced them that he actually had invented a</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical method for controlling the flight and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">course of an aeroplane without a pilot. The matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of releasing the bomb at a certain time was simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">a matter of definite radio waves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think," finally remarked President Strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that Farrol and I had better go to Washington</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see the President and the Secretary of War."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It would not do a bit of good," replied John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farrol. "They would not believe us, and, even if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did, it would simply precipitate the war by</seg><seg type="columnLine">premature publicity. My idea is to work this</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem out ourselves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Somewhat like this. They will send those planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in large groups, probably twenty-five for New</seg><seg type="columnLine">Orleans, fifty for St. Louis, one hundred for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denver, three hundred for the Canal Zone. Maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">as many as five hundred for cities like Chicago and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New York. These groups will all go out at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time and be under the control of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave lengths. They will be supposed to travel in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a straight line, but, at the same time, they will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of being guided by radio waves from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">central office in Mexico. In my description of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper use of such fleets for commercial purposes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I advised that in each fleet of freight planes there</seg><seg type="columnLine">be one plane with a pilot who would serve to send</seg><seg type="columnLine">messages by radio as to the exact location of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">airfleet. Suppose we imagine five hundred planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent in a bee line from Mexico to New York?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Among these will be a plane with a pilot. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the squadron of planes arrives at New York, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot sends a signal to the central office and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">send out the radio wave necessary to release the</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred bombs, each weighing over a ton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That means five hundred tons of some powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive, liberated at the same time and tearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred sections of New York to pieces. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">is to be done? Simply this. I know that you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done a lot of work with radio and the telephone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You know all that there is to be known about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">amplification of sound. Make the largest one that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can and tune it in for the earliest detection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred airplane motors. They cannot run five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred of those new Burns motors in one group</seg><seg type="columnLine">without making a lot of noise. Then, just as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it is certain that the fleet is heading for New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York, capture it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Capture it!" exclaimed President Strange.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Certainly. It is under the control of certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave lengths, sent from Mexico. I know just exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">how that was described in my patent papers. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not believe that there is a man, either in Mexico</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Japan, who has the ability to change that code.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, we will send a radio wave to that special</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet that is to attack New York, causing the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet to go sharply to the right. That is all, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are going to do. The fleet goes 011. Of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pilot may realize that he is off the course and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he may not. We shall have to take chances.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps there will not be any pilot. At any rate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will have those planes going out over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantic. When we are sure that they are in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right place, we will release the bombs, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be released anyway, because the planes will</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a certain speed, and they will have estimated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exact time at which they reach New York. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, by that time, they will be out over the At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantic. Even if they do not release the bombs, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes are going to land in the ocean, because they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are going to run short of gas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That ought to work for New York, but how</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the other cities?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think that we can work them. Each fleet will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be operating under a different code, but the key</seg><seg type="columnLine">code that I invented will control any of the varia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, just as a bunch of skeleton keys always has</seg><seg type="columnLine">a master key. We will have a large sound receptor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and amplifier in every city that we expect to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacked, and a trained man at every city station.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The air fleet, attacking the western cities, can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent out to the Pacific. Those threatening the Gulf</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Atlantic Coast cities can easily be deflected east-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. I think that the best thing that we can do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the valley cities is to turn the fleets around</seg><seg type="columnLine">and send them right back to Mexico to blow up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great, wide, open spaces.

The logical thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for them to do is to send these fleets out at different</seg><seg type="columnLine">times so that all the cities will be torn to bits within</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least one hour of each other. That means that</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as soon as we hear one fleet, we can at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect the other. Naturally, the great flocks of air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds, sent to destroy the larger cities, will be heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, because they will make the most noise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me ask you one thing, Mr. Farrol," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">President Strange. "Do you really think that Uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versal Electrics can handle this themselves?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have to! You control the electrical and</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio brains of the nation. The Japs are going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">send twenty thousand planes over within twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hours of each other. What could the nation do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting them in the old way? We have not nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that many pilots, counting them all. If we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy a machine, the bomb would fall with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine anyway and do a certain amount of dam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age. We could do something with individual planes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">During the last war, our pilots were just as brave</seg><seg type="columnLine">as any, and we still have brave men in the service;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the odds against them would be too great. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, there is the question of my pride. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japs stole my invention and fractured my skull.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If I can invent a radio control of those planes, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can use that control to take charge of their planes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want to do it. I can have your factory make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the necessary apparatus in a few days. I believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you have in your employ fifty men that are</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant enough to learn the code and how to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Place a man and an amplifier and a control</seg><seg type="columnLine">set in every large city. If you can do so, put extra</seg><seg type="columnLine">men there, so that during every minute of the 24</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours, a man can be constantly on duty. Have all</seg><seg type="columnLine">three men sleep and eat and live at the machines."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The President of the Electrical Company looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his experts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can we do it?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have to!" was their only reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Great Gamble</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FROM that moment on there was no rest for</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Farrol and the wizards of the Universal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Electric. They worked and ate and slept, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had to, and soon awoke to work and eat to</seg><seg type="columnLine">another point of exhaustion. President Strange took</seg><seg type="columnLine">his full share of the work. At the end of the ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">days the apparatus was finished, and shipment was</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun to every large city in the United States and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Canal Zone. At each of these cities an office</seg><seg type="columnLine">was opened on the roof of the Universal Electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">building and the three guardians of the safety of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that city installed. With a sigh of relief, Farrol and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strange received the wireless message from San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco that that station was all ready for any</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was now nothing to do except to wait.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The entire work, costing several millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars, had been done on the guess of one man</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to what was going to happen. If he guessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong; if, through the silence of Strange and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farrol, the cities of the United States were blown</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bits, then, one of the greatest and most needless</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragedies of history would be the result.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without taking Farrol into his confidence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Strange had employed several of the most brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">detectives in the States to make an examination of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this new Mexican aviation camp and of the proposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">army invasion. Their report confirmed in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">detail the story that Farrol had told during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first interview. There were over a thousand trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">aviators there in the camp, but not one of them was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do anything more than simply take the machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in the air, place them under the automatic con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol and then parachute down. No pilot was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually make the trip. Try as the detectives could,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could not learn when the attack was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">made, but it was a simple matter for Strange to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have an observation station located in the heights</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the surrounding mountains and a powerful trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitting station installed. They found furthermore</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs of strange activity at the Pacific Coast where</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great number of presumably commercial vessels</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gathered. And yet America slumbered un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of the danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the observation station, the first news of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attack came to the weary and almost desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in the central office at New York. It came</seg><seg type="columnLine">through in code, a code that read something about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peach blossoms being in bloom and the skylark</seg><seg type="columnLine">soaring in the sky. The . . . and the . . . followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other in rapid succession, and finally read,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when decoded:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Five hundred planes headed northward ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes ago. Now five hundred are going north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">west. (Silence for 10 minutes) one thousand going</seg><seg type="columnLine">north east. Can see perfectly. Only a few para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chutes. Must have perfected a means of starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">without pilots. (One hour later).

Growing dark but can hear planes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morning came and still the radio told of departing</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes. At last, came the final message.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Still some planes at the camp. No activity. Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not believe that there will be any more fleets sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">out.

Radio instructions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the time that the first message had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent out from this observation station on the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain top overlooking the camp, the word of warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been flashed to each of the fifty control stations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now began one of the strangest, most peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">and most remarkable battles that was ever fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the control of a nation. On one side were</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty thousand airplanes, hurling through the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">governed in the flight by radio waves from a cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tral station, and not one of those planes carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">a human being, either as passenger or as pilot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those planes were being sent against fifty of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great cities of the United States, in some instances,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as many as five hundred being directed against a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single city. They were started at different times,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their departure being so arranged that the cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">would all be bombed within an hour of each other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twenty- thousand planes each carrying a ton of high</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosives, probably a hundred times as effective</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the T. N. T. of the World War.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Opposed to these there was not a single airplane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the great fleets of the air ships passed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States that night, they were practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">unobserved. Flying in triangular formation at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great height, they might have been looked on by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country people as flocks of wild geese, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BLOODLESS WAR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">migrating ducks. The War Department did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize what was going on till it was all over; even</seg><seg type="columnLine">had they realized the danger on the last day, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been unable to put more than two hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred combat planes into the battle, and these fleets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of enemy airplanes were moving in so many di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rections that no concerted movement would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been possible in an effort to stop them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The battle in the air was one of waves, not of</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine guns. From the date of this battle, men</seg><seg type="columnLine">(lew in the air, but gave up all idea of duelling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other. Twenty thousand deadly planes crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the border that night, and their only opposition was</seg><seg type="columnLine">composed of one hundred and fifty trained radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">operators at fifty stations, one station in each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the threatened cities. Three men to save New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">from destruction; three more men to keep desola-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion from Chicago; three men to ward off threaten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing doom from cities like Denver, Philadelphia and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Los Angeles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">&gt; v</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Saved!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JOHN Farrol and Jacob Strange were in charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the New York station. What happened there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was typical of what happened at each of the others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two men sat at the radio controls, silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for their sound receptors to tell the news</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the approaching fleet. The amplification was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful as modern science could devise. An en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely new invention enabled the distance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching sounds to be recorded on a dial. Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequently, it was an easy matter to determine the</seg><seg type="columnLine">position of the coming fleet at any minute. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">men waited at the controls, pale, sweating, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in spite of themselves, trembling. In deadly silence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half dozen experts stood near them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, John Farrol exclaimed,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The New York fleet is passing over Philadel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phia! The time has come to swing them into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started to broadcast in code. Again and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sent the same message. Meantime, he was look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the distance dial. Suddenly, the hand, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had recorded ninety miles, paused, and then ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced slowly, eighty, seventy, sixty, fifty, forty ...</seg><seg type="columnLine">the experts looked at each other. Was it a failure?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was the entire protective scheme useless? But</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw the thin, white face of Farrol, the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventor, relax, and then smile. Now, the hand on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distance dial began to move in the opposite di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection . . . fifty . . . sixty . . . seventy . . : one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred . . . long minutes of waiting that seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">eternity. The sound from the amplifying receptors</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be growing less. Three hundred miles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are out to sea. The nation is saved!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed Farrol, turning to the President of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Universal Electric. "I think that I shall try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberate the bombs. Of course, we shall never know</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether they have dropped or not, for they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall into the ocean instead of on the greatest city</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the world. Still, we had better try to release</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, for there is no telling how far the planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">will go before they run out of gas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For another ten seconds he broadcasted another</seg><seg type="columnLine">code signal. Then he arose from his seat, and wiped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sweat covered face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Strange," he said, "We ought to get in</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch with the other stations. Are you sure that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they had orders to call us up when their work was</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, as though in answer to his question, mess-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages began to come in code through the air. San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco and Los Angeles had had no trouble in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sending their enemies into the Pacific Ocean. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, the next half hour disclosed the fact that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the coast cities had successfully provided a</seg><seg type="columnLine">watery grave for their antagonists. The border</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities, like San Antonio and Houston, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to completely reverse the course of the fleets</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacking them, but. at the same time, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to send them out into the Gulf of Mexico.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago and St. Louis had sent their fleets into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dakotas and were anxiously trying to make them</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop their bombs in the prairies before they crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Canadian border. In every case, the threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities had been saved. It was too early to tell what</seg><seg type="columnLine">damage had been done by the bombs dropped in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rural districts of the border states, or whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canada had escaped loss of life or property.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The finishing of the reports could be left to</seg><seg type="columnLine">subordinates. Now was the time for sharper action.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farrol and Strange left at once by air express for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Washington. There they demanded and obtained</seg><seg type="columnLine">an interview with the President and his cabinet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a few words they told the story of the threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">cataclysm and how the danger had been averted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was for the President and his advisers to decide</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a satisfactory plan of action against Mexico and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japan. This was difficult. No state of war had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared, and, as far as was known, not a life had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been taken. Most of the attacking planes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunk in the oceans, and, thus, their value as evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">was destroyed. It was realized that the enemies</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a spy system that would not waste any time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in reporting the entire failure of the proposed de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction of billions of dollars of property.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as they sat there debating on their next</seg><seg type="columnLine">move, the Mexican Ambassador called in person.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He bore a personal message from the President of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nation. There had been a serious misunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing. The country below the Rio Grande had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been badly treated by Japan. They had made an</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreement, so they thought, only for commercial</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposes, but, when it was too late, they had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered that military action was intended. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexican Government seriously regretted this and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped that there had been no loss of life or serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction of property. If anyone had been killed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were willing to pay an indemnity. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">message was delivered in a most serious manner to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the President and his cabinet, augmented by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of Farrol and Strange.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Farrol Speaks Out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE President of the United States heard this</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable statement without moving a muscle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his face.

The ride was, at first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything but eventful; the sun was hot, the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm. Gradually Jose fell farther and farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind until suddenly awakened by the shying of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his horse he recalled his responsibility and whip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping up his horse was surprised to find his mistress</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding in the company of a man who was likewise</seg><seg type="columnLine">horsed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The stranger's costume struck Jose as singular,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the equestrian was entirely wrapped in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">black, completely enfolding cape. Under his wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brimmed hat was a tanned hawkish face that re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded the equerry of a bird.

Jose fell back again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was aroused from his lethargy only when a piercing</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream brought him to attention. Spurring up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse he raced ahead. The path took a wide curve,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hairpin curve in truth and although the voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">near at hand it was necessary for him to ride in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wide circle to reach the spot from where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice had come. He saw the two horses grazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly beside the road but there was no sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their riders!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leaping from his horse Jose looked about. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground ten feet away he found the long cape</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stranger, and to it was adhering several black</seg><seg type="columnLine">feathers, glossily ashine, and several inches in</seg><seg type="columnLine">length. Farther on he found Miss Hally's stiff</seg><seg type="columnLine">little riding hat. But though he searched in all di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rections and repeatedly called her name there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer. Once he glanced up at the sky and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">what appeared to be a large bird of black flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">high and very swiftly though he appeared to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying a burden. It was only after much question-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that he bethought himself of the bird, but, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, the police did not consider that a clue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevertheless the disappearance of Marian Hally is</seg><seg type="columnLine">still one of the unsolved mysteries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the following week there were several tales</seg><seg type="columnLine">that paralleled that of Miss Hally. And it was found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was always a man with a black cape near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scene of the abduction. Someone was sure to</seg><seg type="columnLine">liken him to a bird and usually a few feathers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">different colors were found! The hue and cry went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out for a black caped man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was in Quito, Ecuador, on March 17th that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the real clue came to light. It was in the new Sal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vadora Hotel where Miss Hilda Berkenhart was</seg><seg type="columnLine">visiting with her father. The Berkenharts are of</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Swedish-German stock and Miss Berkenhart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blonde and handsome, was often spoken of as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">V'iking Maid. Junoesque, tall, wide-shouldered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">overflowing with the vitality of her healthy body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was a true daughter of that once great race,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a prize-winner if ever there was one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It appears that she, with several other guests</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hotel, had entered the lift. One by one the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others got off at their floors. She had a room several</seg><seg type="columnLine">floors higher. She, and a tall slender man with fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">aquiline features, and wearing a dark blue cape that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung to his feet, were now the only occupants</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the elevator-boy. The latter was a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender Irishman who had found his way into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny country on the Equator, and he was sudden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly aroused from his memories of the Emerald Isle</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he realized his male passenger had addressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. 'Drive to the roof!' had been the command.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Berkenhart started to protest, but turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy saw that the be-caped man held a revolver</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained on them both. Up they went to the roof.</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Get out!' The girl and boy under the persuasion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun hurried to obey. From under his cape the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man next brought forth a length of cord. 'Tie her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hapds together,' he had directed the elevator oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ator; and under the menace of the revolver the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed him to do it. 'Now tie her feet'. That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done. 'Go back to the lift now and descend to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lobby!'</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEN WITH WINGS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">61</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quaking, the youth retreated to the elevator</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft and started the motor, but he did not descend</seg><seg type="columnLine">far. He lowered the machine just enough to allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes to be on a level with the roof-floor. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">noiseless was the well-oiled machinery that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the cape did not hear. Later the operator</seg><seg type="columnLine">reported what he had seen. The man had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed to the girl's side and said something to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the closed door of the lift muffled, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy saw her smile bravely. Then the strange man</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed off his cape!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The boy had to rub his eyes to make sure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he had seen. The man was standing in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">close-fitting costume of white that seemed skin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight, decorated with a snow of colored feathers--</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright and glistening. However, that was not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangest part of him. He was winged! On his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back pressed against his shoulder blades were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of wings, wings such as a condor might have.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boy swore they were easily five feet in length</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the shoulder blades to within a few inches of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's heel, wings with long glossy feathers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden brown intermingled with yellow and darker</seg><seg type="columnLine">shades of brown. For joy of being free from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">binding cape the wings seemed to stretch them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves and there was easily a spread of twelve feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">from tip to tip!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Smiling kindly the winged man had turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl who tried to draw away from him in fear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Irish boy admitted that the man was hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some, with his bird-like features and his dark wavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair and sea-blue eyes that had the distance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky in their depths. He walked toward Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berkenhart and as gently as a mother picked her</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, settled her comfortably in his arms and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great surge of those gigantic wings arose straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">up into the heavens with his burden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For several moments the boy watched the flight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on the streets below were people who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring in wonder, for they too had seen the take-</seg><seg type="columnLine">off. When the youth reached the hotel lobby his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were rolling. He reported what he had seen. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">great roar took hold of the city. The boy's word was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not doubted. Others had seen. Rather the fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">was looked upon as a saviour. At last there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something tangible to work on. A winged man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had carried off Miss Berkenhart. A winged man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had carried off Miss Hally! Winged men had</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried off women in South America for two hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred years. It was all explained. Latin America</seg><seg type="columnLine">is satisfied. The mystery is solved!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is the mystery solved?" asked Brent in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluding. "Surely it has just begun. What are these</seg><seg type="columnLine">men with wings? Who are they? From whence</seg><seg type="columnLine">have they come? What sort of beings are they?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Has Science overlooked something? Is Darwin</seg><seg type="columnLine">right? What have evolutionists to say? Does this</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove or disprove? And what has become of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">women, our girls that have been carried away?</seg><seg type="columnLine">For what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brent then went on to question the possibilities.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had South America given birth to a new race of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men? Was there some Lost World in that half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">explored continent? Were these new creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds or men?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Strange Tale</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">npHE next day the papers came out with edi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torials concerning this new man, this new</seg><seg type="columnLine">menace. Had a new race actually been evolved?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was this to change the entire theory of evolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion? Where would Darwin and his monkeys be</seg><seg type="columnLine">now? Could it be true that the Pterodactyl, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying reptile, was our ancestor instead of the ape?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was South America a new breeding-place of man?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> New tales of abductions appeared. It looked as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if this alated race had come out of their two cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turies of seclusion and were deliberately making</seg><seg type="columnLine">war upon humanity, on white women! A pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying over a section of the Brazilian jungles came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back with the tale of his sighting a winged man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and giving chase. He tells of having caught up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fellow, and he estimated that the flying creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">was traveling at the speed of about eighty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">per hour!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seeing the plane draw alongside of him the bird-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man waved and before the pilot realized his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention he had risen above the machine and then as</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly as a bird alighted on a wing, as close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot as he could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pedro Mureno, the pilot, described the fellow as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a young chap of perhaps twenty-two with fair hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blue eyes. His wings were snowy white. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled brightly and appeared very curious about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane, his eyes darting about and taking it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. The speed of the machine evidently intrigued</seg><seg type="columnLine">him for it was doing a hundred and fifty miles an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour. He crawled through the struts to the pilot's</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and attempted to converse with him, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise of the engine prevented that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mureno turned a loop for the edification of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth and performed several other maneuvers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunts, and the boy laughed with pleasure. Mureno</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of taking him back to the base a prisoner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but, as if divining his purpose, the other laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, crawled to the edge of the wing and dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the plane. Mureno circled him for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes chagrined that he was unable to make his</seg><seg type="columnLine">capture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taking the opportunity to show off, the winged</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth now did stunts. Rising rapidly above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane he suddenly closed his wings so that he fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a stone for almost five hundred feet and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly opened his wings halting his fall as</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly as he began it. He gave a pretty demon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stration of a bird chasing insects, darting, banking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">soaring, whirling and plunging with the sun ashine</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the beauty of his snow-white plumage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned somersaults, lay on his back with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings spread under him, circled, turned sharply at</seg><seg type="columnLine">right angles, climbed straight upwards and sailed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then came tobogganing down again. At last tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">of play and wanting to be rid of his spectator with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wave of his hand he commenced rising straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward again and before Mureno realized his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention, headed into the bright glare of the sun that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was soon to set. To Mureno, it was as if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually flown directly into the heart of the flaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">star.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later that same trick of the flying men was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prove rather trying to aviators giving them</seg><seg type="columnLine">chase, for once in the full glare of the sun it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible for the pilots to make them out, blinded</seg><seg type="columnLine">62</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as they were by the sun. The trick also gave rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the supposition that the winged men came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun, were not of Earthly origin after all. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, only the ignorant would believe such a tale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER TWO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Three Start</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND still the kidnappings continued with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the police baffled, always just too late.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Planes were called into service, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">invariably arrived too late or else were eluded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A soldier did manage to shoot an abductor</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he bore off with a girl and they both plunged to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their death. Thereafter orders.were issued that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be no more shooting, but to capture alive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A second flying man with his prey was chased into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Andes mountain fastnesses and there lost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It appeared as if the winged men knew no</seg><seg type="columnLine">caution; the purloining of women became more</seg><seg type="columnLine">daring, more spectacular. North Europeans with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their wives and daughters were fleeing homeward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and most of the American residents in Latin</seg><seg type="columnLine">countries were sending their families back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">States. Married women appeared to be no safer</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the single girls. All South American govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments were calling for aid from their northern</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighbors with their superior air-craft and air-men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor was America quiet. Its people were up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms demanding that the government do all they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could to fight this menace to American woman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood.

The air was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">made unsafe for flying men!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still disgruntled over the scoop made by Brent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a plan came to me and I confronted the city editor</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my scheme. Three years earlier I had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one of the Smithsonian expeditions into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart of the Amazon country. I knew the country.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew several Indian dialects. And now all reports</seg><seg type="columnLine">were pointing to the fact that the winged men had</seg><seg type="columnLine">their home in Brazilian jungles. Why could I not</seg><seg type="columnLine">go down there and alone find my way to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">settlement? I would get the complete story, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">history of this new race, and their intentions! I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man to do it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sims, the city editor, had to think it over. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded good. It was. The next morning I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">summoned to his desk. Of course I had not slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that night and now was feverishly awaiting that</seg><seg type="columnLine">call. Plans had already been laid. I was to go with</seg><seg type="columnLine">two more trusted men, Jack D'Arcy and Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norton, also reporters on the News.

Howard Wormley the famous aviator was</seg><seg type="columnLine">our pilot.

The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">papers were of course filled with the latest ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ductions. A most daring one had occurred aboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great trans-pacific air liner going from Hono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lulu to San Francisco.

We were to fly over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle lands in hope of discovering the settlement</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the flying men. Then we would land our plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some clearing and proceed on foot. In the mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time we scouted in the city which was one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oldest in Peru and filled with Indians. Many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Indians told tales of flying men they had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">from time to time. However, they were very close-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthed and did not seem anxious to speak of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, possibly believing them to be some new sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gods.

We sought him out!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dwelt below the city of Arequipa some two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred miles south of Cuzco.

Early the next morning with a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hired arrieros (muleteers) we made our way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiny village where the old fellow was said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peru at best is a wild country made up of pampas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserts and mountain heights. It is a rugged place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of irregular rivers that cut deep terrible canyons</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tremendous water-falls. It is a country of mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery, of ancient grandeur, of ghosts of the Inca, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor ill-clad peons who are the descendants of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">once great race. What cultivation there is, is done</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a very intensive scale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since large areas of the country is desert there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a grain of fertile soil wasted. The fertile belts</seg><seg type="columnLine">are usually on the river banks and the farms are set</seg><seg type="columnLine">on series of terraces that had been built originally</seg><seg type="columnLine">under Inca direction and are farmed in much the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same way as they were hundreds of years ago. Nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the climate of the country equable.

Sometimes we climbed rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">high and then dropped down into valleys. Most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our trip, however, was along the edge of a raging</seg><seg type="columnLine">torrent and the path was rough. At places where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river's gorge narrowed, stone steps had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut out of living rock by the Incas, we were told.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sometimes a causeway constructed by the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">builders took us across the wild waters or else our</seg><seg type="columnLine">mules picked their way delicately along the crum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling road-bed where every foot fall precipitated a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain of gravel to the river below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After almost a two day's journey we came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovel of Senor Majes, a decrepit old chap whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of hair, teeth and cataracted eye-balls attested</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his great age. Luckily I could understand a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">words of his dialect so I did not need to depend en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely on our guides for interpretation.

He named then a place where we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet and with his great wings he rose straight into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'And did you meet him?" I asked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The peon nodded. "Ay .. .ay .. had he not paid me</seg><seg type="columnLine">for my labor? I bid good bye to my wife, my little</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones and my friends, and I went to the place where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had bidden me go. There were others there, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine strong men like me. He was there and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him many of his kind. With them they had a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammock of woven bark shaped like a canoe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were hidden to take our places therein. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fifty of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We did not hesitate but sat in the hammock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the men with wings each took a hold of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-boat, for such it was and together they bore us</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and over the trees! For many hours we sailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">more smoothly than a boat sails the river, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the setting of the western sun we descended. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">found ourselves on a vast plantation, and we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">given food and drink and a place to lay our heads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, never before was there such a farm. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor cultivation that you see here in these hills is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not like that. How far it stretched there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of telling. There I worked in the fields with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my fellow men for a year and again the flying men</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to bring us back here to our friends and our</seg><seg type="columnLine">families."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You can imagine how I felt when I heard this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The winged men therefore had settlements, plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tations and what not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Were there many winged men?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pedro shook his head. "I know not their number.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They brought us and they took us away, but how</seg><seg type="columnLine">many there were, I know not. They did not live</seg><seg type="columnLine">near us.

Ay . . . the weight of the sacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they bore off ... twice the weight that even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strongest of us could bear!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where did they carry it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pedro shrugged his shoulders. "Is it for me, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowly peon, to speak of god-things? Does one ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the Sun dwells? Nay ... I know not, senor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know only that they will come again . . . and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it will be to lead us back ... to give us what be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longs to us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And no further questioning could bring another</seg><seg type="columnLine">word from the old fellow. It was enough, though.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not more than a day's flight away dwelt the flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. That would mean then that their plantation</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in Bolivia instead of Brazil, however, for Are-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quipa is parallel to the Bolivian border. It appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">later that I made a mistake, in not realizing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hundred odd years old Pedro had not always</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived in this locality but in reality he had lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther to the north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Futile Searching</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER returning to Arequipa we spent two</seg><seg type="columnLine">days in flying over a portion of Bolivia. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, all of the western part of that country is</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountainous, and we began to think that Pedro had</seg><seg type="columnLine">led us astray, for not once did we catch so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a glimpse of a winged creature except a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of condors who made their homes among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain peaks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We decided then to fly back to Cuzco and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinue our search from there. We heard nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of much interest in the city, but more planes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">arriving to take up the search. We, however, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined to get ahead of them all and headed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the vast jungle country. Below us lay the</seg><seg type="columnLine">montam, the jungles on the eastern slopes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andes and which is known as the Upper Amazon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flying over the wild country that rolled below</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, for the first time we felt qualms of doubt. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">were we to ever find the settlement of the dated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this wide stretch of unexplored land? No plane had</seg><seg type="columnLine">as yet located anything that looked as if it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be inhabited--the jungle presented nothing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles and miles of tangled masses of tropical vege-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation and massive trees, gentle slopes and occasion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally a bald spot of leprous white amid the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of green.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rivers wound through over-grown banks appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and disappearing, lakes blinked up at us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamps and deserts stretched below. We saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few spirals of smoke that set our hearts beating,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to discover them to be nothing but the cooking</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires of a poor sort of Indian village. Once on a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">hilltop we saw something we took to be a city</seg><seg type="columnLine">which turned out to be merely some Inca ruins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What if after all these winged men had no base,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but like the Indians were a wandering people mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing day by day. Suppose that Pedro Majes after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all merely dreamed that he had been carried off by</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying men, that his imagination had been fired by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tales he had heard of the men with wings?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only the fact that they had a great many women,</seg><seg type="columnLine">kidnapped women, and a number of children per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">haps, made us think that they had some fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwelling place. How large their settlement might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, we could not guess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For two days we flew and in that time descried</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one of our quarry. He immediately flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight into the bright ball of the burning sun so</seg><seg type="columnLine">we lost sight of him, even though we put on</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoked glasses. He faded completely out of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Disappointed we sulked in Cuzco. We decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we were wasting our time. We must go on</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot into the country and search on the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We hired a band of Indians to guide us through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungles and went to sleep determined to start</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in the morning on this new venture. We did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not start that morning, however, for some of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians had decided they did not wish to go. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent the day in gathering a new band.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Clue</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ABOUT four o'clock that afternoon some fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">news came and again our plans were changed!</seg><seg type="columnLine">A radio report had come in from a questing pilot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flying low through the jungles not more than nine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty miles from the border of Peru, he had suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">come upon a great band of flying men!

Im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately as if at a signal the large party separated</seg><seg type="columnLine">but still keeping a formation they flew upward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">outward straight into the sky until a great circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand feet above the plane was spread.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Were they to attack me in a body," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadcaster from his plane, "they could by laying</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands upon the machine bear it down to the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it is evident that they wish me to go my way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For some reason I suspicion that I am close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their base.

If these fellows have</seg><seg type="columnLine">some means of destroying the plane . . . we'll be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hell of a fix!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Acting on his suggestion I caught up one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear-phones that communicated with the driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat; for D'Arcy and I were riding in the passenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin while Norton rode with Wormley, the pilot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately we commenced circling down look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for a clearing in which to land. We saw two</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearings that were not very large and appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">too irregular for our purpose. Then the trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">great giants, spread out before us without a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">break mile after mile. We turned about then for</seg><seg type="columnLine">we did not wish to get too close to the village of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the winged men. We recalled the fate of the pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Norton who called my attention to a sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">below. On the highest tree top we could make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">a figure and it was waving to us, beating both</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms over its head. D'Arcy cried out. "It's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a woman and Wormley dropped lower so</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to pass close to her when as suddenly as she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared she vanished from our sight into the thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">foliage of the trees, pulled from below. We could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do nothing but stare at the place she had been, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we skimmed overhead. We did not doubt but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was indeed a captive, one of the hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls who had been abducted in the last few months.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were wild with joy now. The search was</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. Below us we would find our quest. We knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same time that if we now returned to Cuzco</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the news and brought out a squadron of rescue</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes we would have been heroes indeed. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired, rather, by the eagerness to carry out our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission we decided in favor of landing, if we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">only park our plane somewhere! We had no way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of knowing then that our decision was to cost our</seg><seg type="columnLine">party two lives, but on the other hand our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans would have carried no weight at all in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next turn of events.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turning back we continued to look for a clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, but the winged men had already a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme for us. We had no sooner turned about</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we heard murmurs through our communica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation lines from Wormley. We could not under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand what he was saying, but it became noticeable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to D'Arcy and myself that the plane was acting</seg><seg type="columnLine">queerly. Then we almost took a nose dive, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a superhuman effort Wormley held the nose up. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke into his phone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm losing control," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">We held on to our seats not knowing what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming. It was D'Arcy who first noted that he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cold and I began to feel the chill in the air, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">northern chill that did not belong to the equator.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Wormley lost entire control of the ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">D'Arcy let out a yell. "We're moving backwards!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was true, the plane was actually running back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, and in a circling motion, the earth seeming</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging about the trees slipped from under us</seg><seg type="columnLine">grotesquely and the propeller was whirling crazily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Too, it was growing dark around us although it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only about ten o'clock in the morning! I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the sun shining as if through a haze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the propeller stopped we stared at the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless blades blankly. The engine was dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but we continued to move around in a great circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though we were being pulled along on a string!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The chill was increasing each minute and we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">shivering. I remembered the words of the pilot who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had managed to broadcast the course of events be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he fell to . . . what? What was happening</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us? Were we to die under the hands of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had come to discover?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now with the engine stalled we were moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster and faster until below us through the grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing darkness we could see the jungle sweeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazily around in a blurred vision. It had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">so cold that I was entirely numbed, my sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then: "God! We're falling . . . falling ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The trees were coming up to meet us. I had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of a big wall crashing toward us. I covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">my face with my hands. The crash came and our</seg><seg type="columnLine">screams reverberated in my ears as I sank into</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness that swept over me. And through it I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard voices and dreamed of giant eagles who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripping my flesh from my bones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Toll</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">^SAT'HEN I came to consciousness I wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">' » at finding myself in a hospital room. I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called after racking my brains what had happened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I remembered the day's flight, the flying men, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar antics of our plane and the fall. Beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I could remember nothing and wondered now</seg><seg type="columnLine">how I had been transported back to the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some minutes I lay staring at the sky-light</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead, through which diffused a sunlight like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of northern skies. Then turning my head I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at the four walls, and the white beds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which there were five beside mine. Two, I saw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were occupied. For a moment 1 did not recognize</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bandage swathed face of the figure in the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed to mine as that of Howard Wormley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello," I said, addressing that hidden face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"could you tell me what I am doing here, and how</seg><seg type="columnLine">I arrived?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The figure turned over and when he spoke I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cognized him. "Well, it's about time you came to,</seg><seg type="columnLine">old fellow. I hasn't been pleasant lying here for</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven days watching to see if you breathed or not!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, it's you Wormley," I said, "Where's Norton</seg><seg type="columnLine">and D'Arcy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard him sigh through his bandages, "Norton</seg><seg type="columnLine">died immediately . . . and there's D'Arcy in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other bed.

I felt as though I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been through a meat grinder. 1 shuddered when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke of Norton and D'Arcy. They were good</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows, two of the best reporters on the News,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and good sports too. I peered over at the quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">form lying stiffly without movement on the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just what happened?" I asked, "and how did we</seg><seg type="columnLine">get back here to Cuzco?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One at a time . . . and not so much at once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">please.

Somehow I had never thought of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibility of there being winged women. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers had been full of winged men, but none had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever mentioned women with wings. Nor could T</seg><seg type="columnLine">have dreamed that she could be so like an angel!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First I saw the gold of her close cropped hair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue of deep far-seeing eyes, a face such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harris Fishel might seek in vain. Clothed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight fitting smock and snug trousers of Mentor she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was a picture to behold and needed only the pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful rainbow-hued wings to make an angel of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She carried her wings as angels should, the tips</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearing just at the shoulder line, the end feathers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">long and fine, dragging several inches on the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind her. (Such Mentorites as have gone a-kid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">napping usually cut those long ends to prevent de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tection). Her hands were long and slender with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue veins outlined under the sun-browned skin. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">always puzzled me (I noted these last items at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">later period) how the tall girl (she was five feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nine inches tall without heels) managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk so easily and lightly on the tiny little feet she</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed which were so beautifully molded that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did not appear to have been constructed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">use. Her shoes, incidently, were but flat soft pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tanned bird skins of about two dozen thicknesses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">held on the bare foot by straps that crossed and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had come directly to the side of my bed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she smiled brightly I thought I should cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with the pain of it.

"Are reporters a breed dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent then from other men?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wormley burst out into a wild guffaw that ended</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly in the middle.

The sight of him carried me back to New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York. He might have been merely a physician</seg><seg type="columnLine">paying his daily call at his clinic. He had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings or signs of any. Surely he did not belong</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Brazilian jungles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later I learned that he was from New York,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had come to Mentor of his own accord,</seg><seg type="columnLine">preferring his work here among the flying people</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his fashionable clientele on Park Avenue. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was head of the medical corps and he loved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winged people more than he could ever have loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">his millionaire clients.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," he said quietly, "we lost one, but we</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to save two!" and he smiled. "I surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">am delighted to see you looking so good, young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. You almost went under. But you'll be as good</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a new babe in a few days. No bones broken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but you were pretty well cut up around your head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shoulders.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must have fallen off to sleep, for it was dark in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room when I was awakened by a nurse (not</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Lois) bringing me some broth. The room was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted with electricity, and I saw that D'Arcy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body had already been removed. After eating I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell asleep again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not awaken until morning and I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wormley already breakfasting and waiting for me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wake up.

However, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cheery and gay as she made us ready for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. When she left us I turned to Wormley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, tell me something," I said, "about this</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. What have you discovered about it anyway?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Feeling chipper, eh? Well, you'll be out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing, I suppose, in a short while and I've got about</seg><seg type="columnLine">a month or so before I can get around on this game</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg of mine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, tell me what kind of a machine they used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pull us down with?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sorry, but I can't say. No one seems anxious</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk about it at all.

"Man-made tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nado."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Um-hum" he nodded. "Just that. I've been thru</seg><seg type="columnLine">one before and I know the signs. What else could</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain the great force that pulled us, the sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness, the chill and the feeling of the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging around."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shook my head sadly. "I don't see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wormley looked at me tolerantly. "Alright, here</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes" he said. "I'll explain. A tornado, you see is</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused by a sudden change, or movement of air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let a cold body of air sweep over a heated place</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it will quickly descend and the heated air will</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise. That creates a spiral movement of the air. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold air descending naturally causes a sudden chill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the great flurry of dust in the air ionized by</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical disturbances obscures the sun and causes</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was beginning to see. "But," I objected, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">always thought that a tornado touched only a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">area."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So it does" Wormley agreed, "That's why this</seg><seg type="columnLine">one must be man made. What I think they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to electrically ionize the dust of the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably even throwing great quantities of dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air. And then they must use some gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine to suck in the air to create the cyclonic</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement in the higher regions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I lay back pondering. So these people had com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand of a great knowledge of science. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well what do you think now" Wormley asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, whatever it was, it certainly did the trick."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Right", Wormley agreed.

Also some philosophers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">prophets as well as some evolutionists in the bunch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too.

Of course in those days</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did not know that the blood circulated so it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rather hit or miss proposition, and Doctor Morris</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to believe that little Howard was far ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It had taken many generations to grow wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the rabbit, but Grandfather Howard was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">discouraged believing rather in posterity and aimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do as much as he could in his life time. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">began right there to attempt to improve the human</seg><seg type="columnLine">species by performing the same operation on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own offspring. He forced his wife to take the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jections, submit to the operation, and also to swal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low another concoction that he brewed himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">made from some part of the bird.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the next ten years he had produced a pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair nucleus for his future generations, his wife giv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing birth to nine children of both sexes.

He had a vast estate somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the back-skirts of Scotland so there were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">prying eyes to watch and condemn him. His next</seg><seg type="columnLine">task was to obtain wives for his growing sons and</seg><seg type="columnLine">husbands for his daughters. His oldest son was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen when he found a wife for him. She submitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">docilely to the old man's administrations and within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a year their baby was born.

One or two whose fortunes were not so</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure came attracted by the beauty of Mentor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughters. A third son of an Earl who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">destined for the church married another of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauties, but there the supply ended. So Mentor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was forced to go down into the cities and buy up</seg><seg type="columnLine">youths who had been incarcerated in the debtor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisons in order to marry off his remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughters.

The little mother must have wept</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her maimed darling and Mentor surely wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy over it, but at the same time he knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first rung of the ladder had been climbed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They could only hope that this was an accident.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The scientist again went into his laboratories and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought forth another mess that was added to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">diet of his family.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The new baby became the pet of the family</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they all tried to keep him from knowing of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">loss.

Somewhat crippled, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">limped on taking bearings by sun and stars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoping that land was near. The captain was new</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this part of the world and only the offer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">more money than he had ever heard of before had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him this far.

I learned later</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had already had a gland operation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're making full-fledged Mentorites out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, old man," Wormley declared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second week I was allowed to sit up in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair to take short walks in and around the hospital.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I discovered just how complete an institution it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. Everything was kept spotlessly clean. Most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the work was devoted to the maternity wards</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the young Mentorites were brought into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world scientifically and as easily as possible. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother out of eight usually died in giving birth to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the winged babies. The death rate had been higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the coming of Doctor Morris and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing all he could to reduce it still more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a dispensary to attend the every-day</seg><seg type="columnLine">sicknesses and accidents such as those brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">about by deadly insects or by the winged people</seg><seg type="columnLine">who sometimes misjudged distances and hurt them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves on limbs of trees, etc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Diseases were practically unknown even in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fever-infested land--for every precaution was taken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Healthy people are not prone to become diseased</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the alate were health}' without a doubt. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, I discovered that every new captive was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarantined miles from the city for the duration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a month before they were allowed to intermingle</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Mentorites, and during that time their</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood was purified and thoroughly cleansed of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurking germ-cells. The reason that Wormley and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not quarantined, of course, was due to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">session in the hospital; and I learned that we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been completely de-germed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the fifth day of my convalescence, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed to climb the flight of steps that led upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and into the jungle. The trees grew high and thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sunlight had difficulty in finding its way</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the branches. To offset this lack of sun in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their underground cities every citizen whose work</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not bring him into the sunlight was forced each</seg><seg type="columnLine">day to take a sun-bath either in the clearings or</seg><seg type="columnLine">else on platforms reared high in the trees--where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beneficial rays of the sun could penetrate. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">once daily a strong violet ray was switched 011 and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept throughout the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A path led away from the entrance to the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way through which I had come. The door itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the trunk of a giant tree that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollowed out and the bark placed 011 the door-panel</seg><seg type="columnLine">so ingeniously that it was difficult to detect that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a doorway from the outside. Nor was the path</seg><seg type="columnLine">I trod a distinct one. It might have been one made</seg><seg type="columnLine">by animals or the Indians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In fact, a stranger might have walked all about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the 'city' or rather atop it and not know that life</seg><seg type="columnLine">seethed beneath his feet. He might have even made</seg><seg type="columnLine">his camp on the top of one of the sky-lights of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the underground community without being aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">that glass and concrete were his bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The jungle had been cleared to some degree so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the winged people might move about more</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily, but the clearing had been done in such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural manner that one passing through the area</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not have noticed particularly that it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been cleared. Strangers had in fact actually passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">this way or camped hereabouts without being the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiser. No wonder Mentor could not be discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by plane!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I came into the forest I met Miss Lois who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was also out for an airing. She joined me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed out the points of interest as we strolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEN WITH WINGS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">71</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">along. Never before had I met a girl who was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural, so simple--without any little coquetries or</seg><seg type="columnLine">subterfuges that one usually looks for in the sex.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She accepted me merely as a companion and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected me to do the same with her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several Mentorites passed us, men and women</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their variegated wings dragging in the dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind, all clad in the tight fitting costume that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave no resistance to the wind in flying. One fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed who had the half formed wings of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Earthbound" as they called them, the people bred</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the two races, winged and unwinged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were many of these people in Mentor des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tined never to fly but to give birth rather to child-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ren that would, one day, fly. They took their place</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ranks as did the others. They were, in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the workers, holding responsible positions in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">underground stronghold. They were merely a part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this strange evolution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once, overhead, I heard the beating of wings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Lois bade me look up. Doing so I saw per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps a half a dozen or so winged people flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">down toward us through the trees. At first I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved they would surely tear their wings upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches of the trees, but in looking more closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw that the great branches of the trees had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been cut away to allow about twenty feet clearance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving the akted an entrance and exit to the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These avenues were cut at regular intervals so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would be no danger of crowding when</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger lurked above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Sightseeing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LATER by carrying me up a distance of about</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty feet Miss Lois showed me other avenues</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut horizontally through the trees to give passage</seg><seg type="columnLine">to those who did not wish to expose themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the trees. They could fly many miles within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the protection of the jungles in this manner. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were many of these paths criss-crossing through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great area. Where the trees became thin and gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to glades and clearings wingless men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually stationed to give warning if danger was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We now approached one of the natural clearings</seg><seg type="columnLine">where many people, children and adults alike were</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing or sunning themselves. Here were groups</seg><seg type="columnLine">of woman sitting or lying in the grass talking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">working over lengths of cloth, embroidering</seg><seg type="columnLine">feathers on jackets, shaping garments. Here, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time, I saw a number of fellow "captives."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon our entrance into the glade a tall, slender,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark-haired girl jumped to her feet and came run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning toward me. Almost immediately I recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">her from the picture I had seen in the papers. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Miss Marion Hally. She stopped short a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in front of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are a newcomer, aren't you?'' she asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in a low, throaty voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Miss Hally," I averred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, you know me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only by your photos."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me, then," she said, "have you heard any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about my father? I have been sick with</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry about him. How is he taking my disappear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance ... he had only me . . . you see . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told her of her father's offers of rewards for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovery. Beyond that I knew nothing else. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighed and without another word returned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">group she had deserted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That," said Miss Lois, "is the trouble of stealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">these poor girls. They could be happy with us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I believe, if only they could get in touch with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">people and let them know that they are well ..."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes." I said, "the world is not going to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this wholesale abduction of yours very long!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Up came Miss Lois' chin. "We do not have any</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of that, Jim Kennedy, Mentor knows how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">protect herself!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, why don't you come above board and</seg><seg type="columnLine">show your hand to the world instead of this miser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able woman-stealing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shrugged her shoulders. "It is not for us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ask, Jim Kennedy. The Patriarch will deal with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world when the Time comes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then there will be a Time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She smiled. "Yes, the time is coming when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world will realize that we are a factor to be rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">koned with! They will gladly give us our place in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the World Court!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Unless they annihilate you entirely!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that is impossible of course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I said nothing to that, but I felt it highly im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">probable that this handful of people could stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "May I ask . . . how many people have you here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Lois?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She nodded. "Surely. We divide our population</seg><seg type="columnLine">into two parts, the winged and the Earthbound. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the former we have here in Number One a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than thirty thousand! Of the latter there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">about ten thousand! Of children under the ages</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sixteen there are forty thousand! Then in each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other community there is almost a like number."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Learns Much</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TO say I was astounded was putting it too mild-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. I turned upon Miss Lois in wonder. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean that there are eighty thousand people living</seg><seg type="columnLine">here in this area?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She nodded. "Certainly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And this is only one of several like settlements?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I queried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, at present we have six communities, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Patriarch is directing the construction of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventh city. He has decided that it would be well</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us to have two cities devoted entirely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">children. Our quarters here are becoming too</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hum, then you have a population of almost a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a million people. Good Lord it sounds im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed up at me. "We have forgotten to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clude the 'captives'. There are about two thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them at the present time!

I was thoughtful during the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mainder of the walk. Gosh, if only I could get out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this place and tell my story to the world! What</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scoop this was going to be. The girl's words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, made me realize just how hard it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to be to escape. If. as she said, the surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing country was populated so thickly with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">people what chance would I, a puny man without</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings, to fight my way out into the world again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And with what I now knew it was evident that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not going to allow me to escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Lois appeared to have read my thoughts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is impossible for anyone to escape from Mentor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our Patriarch is not quite ready for the world to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know and it is death to any who makes the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt." She went on to explain just how great an</seg><seg type="columnLine">organization her nation was, how it had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown out its tentacles into the world in general</seg><seg type="columnLine">all unbeknown to the Outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I questioned her about the food supply, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">words told me that Pedro Majes had not lied when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spoke of the plantation to which he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">borne by the winged men. Mentor had not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one plantation to raise her food, but many in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the most fertile countries of the continent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It appears that those born entirely devoid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings were used for the purpose of going out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world establishing themselves and working only</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the good of their race. By taking Spanish names</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen or so Mentorites owned and controlled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plantations from which the winged men carried off</seg><seg type="columnLine">by night the foods that they needed. It was from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the estate of one of these men that Marion Hally</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been spirited away!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They owned mines in the same manner, rubber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plantations, and air lines were controlled by the far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching arm of the Patriarch of Mentor! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth from these enterprises of course flowed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady stream into his coffers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And to further the interests of the nation were</seg><seg type="columnLine">another corps of men and women, the diplomatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">corps that found places of responsibility all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world. They insinuated themselves into posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of trust in Washington, in London, in Paris</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in fact in all the capitals of the world and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted by their fellow-men as one of them; while</seg><seg type="columnLine">in truth their lives were dedicated to the interests</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their own race. It was possible therefore for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to accomplish much for its welfare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was through one of these "spies," that that</seg><seg type="columnLine">infernal engine that had brought our plane down</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bought and brought to Mentor. It had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">invented by a German just after the Great World</seg><seg type="columnLine">War and under the Patriarch's direction had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">purchased for this jungle home ere the world was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to learn about it; and all but one blue print</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the same manner Doctor Morris had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought to Mentor enticed by the tales of one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Patriarch's agents who proved to the Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">the need of the jungles for medical aid. And be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause he had tired of the humdrum life of New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York City he had come to take complete charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the health of the five hundred thousand souls</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the confines of the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every necessity that was needed was brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Outside, just as electricity was carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of miles across the continent by cables</seg><seg type="columnLine">and conduits from three or four points in South</seg><seg type="columnLine">America. The cables were cleverly laid; either in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees or underground as the topography of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only a continent such as South America with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">great unexplored spaces, its great natural resources,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its jungles, could have held the secret of Mentor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could only gasp as I thought of what a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">digous organization had grown out of the aimless</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumblings of Howard Mentor with man-made</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolution. Could this strange though powerful na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion some day put its mark on the world?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER SIX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Patriarch</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON returning to my room, where I was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunking with Wormley, I told him of all I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen and learned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God ... if only the world knew!

Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">day they will have their place in the world and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they will prove the superiority of wings over ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chinery 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night Patriarch Mentor deigned us the</seg><seg type="columnLine">favor of his presence in our ward. He came followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the two aides that were never known to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, two large well-proportioned men of perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty or fifty, winged and as stern-visaged as he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Patriarch was a singularly tall man well over</seg><seg type="columnLine">six feet, with wings of monster size. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">raven black, glossy and ashine in the shaded light of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room. His face was the face of a powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, a man whose entire life had been spent in</seg><seg type="columnLine">attaining power; the sharp gimlet eyes and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hawk-like features with the sun-tanned swarthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin accentuated all that. He was, I judged, forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of age. He was clothed in a suit entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with long black silky feathers. Sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wore white, but never any other color.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I studied him I was suddenly aware of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that the description fitting him so well, cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">responded with the newsbit concerning the abduct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">or of Marian Hally; he also was blackwinged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hawk-faced. Later I learned that Marian Hally</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one of his wives! So the Patriarch was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">above doing a little kidnapping on his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I was seated in my chair and Wormley was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawled on his bed. As the personage entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room I unconsciously arose to my feet. His very</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing was enough to inspire one with a sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his majesty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Challenge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE was the first to speak and his words came</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp and cutting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All, Messers, you have indeed given Mentor an</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor in condescending to pay us a visit," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and to throw your lot in with ours! We trust that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will learn to look upon Mentor as your own."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The glitter that shone in the dark eyes was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Patriarch's manner of expressing keen enjoyment</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as laughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "However," he continued, "I regret, my friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that your arrival accidentally broke your little ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine and of course it will be impossible for you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find your way home through the jungles."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In other words you are informing us that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are your prisoners, eh?" shot out Wormley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One addresses the Patriarch as Sire!" One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attendant aides spoke, fastening cold eyes upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aviator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wormley shrugged his shoulders. "You mean we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are your prisoners . . . sire?" he repeated and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only grin at the audacity of his slurred em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phasis on the word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the gimlet eyes glittered. It could be seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Mentor enjoyed a show of spunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are mistaken, Pilot Wormley," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold harsh voice, "we have no prisoners. When you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been entirely healed and found to be in good</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical condition you will be given the freedom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mentor. Wrhat the jungle holds for you we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">not answer.

"We allow no imperfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings in our midst . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then, would I be allowed to return to my home,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sire ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The jungle lies before you!" and ^ith that</seg><seg type="columnLine">laconic statement he turned on his heel and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shadows departed as quickly and silently as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, that's that, gentlemen," concluded Worm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley. "He dares us to try to get out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm making no attempts to leave here until I</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover all there is to know," I declared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And then you will continue to stay, my dear</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend, if I judge that nice amiable gentleman</seg><seg type="columnLine">right!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We both laughed uproariously as if it were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good joke, but I am sure that Wormley as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself felt just how tight the net lay about us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surely others had tried to escape ere this and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">they reached safety the world would have known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">More Sightseeing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nrHE following day I was given my discharge</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the hospital after Doctor Morris had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">me as thorough an examination as any man ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">had. Evidently I proved to be physically fit as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was put in the charge of a youth whose wings were</seg><seg type="columnLine">but little stumps between his shoulder blades. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">led me to my new quarters through a long under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground corridor. I have forgotten to note that from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first I had been wearing a suit of clothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly like the Mentorites, close fitting and feather</seg><seg type="columnLine">embroidered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One could only marvel at the ingenuity of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentorites in constructing their city under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground; it had taken hard labor and fine engineer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to dig out the large chambers and tunnels be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the jungle giants whose roots often could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen enclosed in cement. It must also take care</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep alive the trees whose roots were so em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bedded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">74</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was led into a fairly large chamber, the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which was upheld by a number of sturdy</seg><seg type="columnLine">columns. This, I gathered was a lounge, for there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were chairs, tables and settees placed conveniently</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. The furnishings were of the simplest, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the most part home-made specimens fashioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">from small saplings and roughly finished. Cushions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of native cloth were filled with soft feathers to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve the body from sharp contact with the rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood. The chair backs were very low for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">benefit of the winged people. A carpet woven of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough dried grasses covered the cement floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everything was clean and neat and disinfectants</seg><seg type="columnLine">were used to keep the air clean and sweet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here and there on the wall were hung examples</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mentorian workmanship, tapestries woven from</seg><seg type="columnLine">variegated feathers often depicting scenes from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">life of the city as well as of the jungle, birds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers. Too, there were a number of paintings</seg><seg type="columnLine">done by native artists that showed power and</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding. Skins of jungle creatures, jaguars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">armadillos, tapirs and alligators were placed about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet with all these embellishments the plain severi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty of the room shone out with something like</seg><seg type="columnLine">puritan simplicity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several doorways opened from this general room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and through one I saw the long tables that bespoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dining room. Odors emanating from there told</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the noon-day meal in preparation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In passing through the lounge my guide, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, had not stopped but took me directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it to another corridor. The open doorways</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed me fairly large-sized rooms with beds set</seg><seg type="columnLine">in neat rows. He took me into one of these rooms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were ten beds to the room, made of saplings</seg><seg type="columnLine">with springs woven from hemp, mattresses that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were filled with sweet smelling grasses and covcred</seg><seg type="columnLine">with thin blankets of feathers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was one of the male dormitories. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side of the lounge were the rooms for women.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ceiling was rather high and I descried several</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings in it and could feel the current of cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh air that came through them. I found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this ventilation was forced through the city by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the means of great fans; the air, being brought in</seg><seg type="columnLine">by big suction pumps, was cleansed and purified</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it was distributed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Electric fixtures were fittted into the ceilings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixtures that were of plain white glass, the lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning throughout the day and night, until, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proper hour, they were turned off simultane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously an one point in the city. Electricity was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only source of power; they cooked with it as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as used it for lighting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Learns the Rules</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MY guide pointed out the bed that was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine and on questioning I found that a bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was reserved for Wormley next to it. I was glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that. The youth then gave me a number which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be mine in the dining hall. Meals, I learned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were served at regular hours and woe to the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was tardy; he must go hungry until the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal unless he could wheedle a bite from a kindly</seg><seg type="columnLine">cook in the kitchen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mentorian kitchens were models of modern</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipage. A small army of workers prepared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foods, each man and woman employed there having</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his own routine laid out for him. The bins and</seg><seg type="columnLine">closets that held the food supplies were roomy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautifully kept, and even though the kitchens were</seg><seg type="columnLine">underground not a bit of smoke ever lingered--</seg><seg type="columnLine">for suction fans carried it off and the smoke itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">was chemically dissolved so that not a wisp of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever escaped. Too, great fans kept the air sweet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fresh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Life in the city was run by clock work. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the hour to arise and the hour to retire, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour for relaxation, the hours for work, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">deviate from the routine was considered a serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">offense. Punishment was not meted out to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">culprit, only there was the disapproval that shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the eyes of his fellow; for a laggard as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sluggard was to Mentorites as bad as being a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thief or a murderer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And to every man and woman was given a job</seg><seg type="columnLine">either manual, clerical or executive whatever he</seg><seg type="columnLine">or she were best suited for. Idleness was not toler-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In each day's schedule there was plenty of time</seg><seg type="columnLine">for relaxation, and by relaxation was meant the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours that belonged to the individual to do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he wished. There were hours for drill, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winged people. This meant drilling in formation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">army drill in other words. For the Earthbound</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Captives it meant drilling to evacuate the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">in record time, a sort of precautionary measure in</seg><seg type="columnLine">case of fire or attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every flying man and woman belonged to a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany and the officers were designated only during</seg><seg type="columnLine">drill hours by a colored band around the forehead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their rank was achieved only by wor\.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even the children had their drills and earned</seg><seg type="columnLine">their places in the rank's only by their achieve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments. After seeing one of the drills I decided that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentor was well defended. It was to be seen that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were never to be taken unawares by their</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I became very interested in the Mentor manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of child rearing. Children stayed with their mothers</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the age of five years when they were turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to the educationalists trained specifically for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their work. The children had their own lounges and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dormitories, their class rooms, their hours for work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for play and drill; and beside their school work</seg><seg type="columnLine">were small tasks and duties for them to perform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor did itappear to me as if these people suffered</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the loss of what we on the Outside consider</seg><seg type="columnLine">our heritage, the right of the individual. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">healthy, strong, happy, normal. There were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">police nor courts for the simple reason that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no thieves, no madmen, no vicious tri-cornered</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs that necessitated litigation; no murders, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">divorce. Children were as gay and happy as if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a mother's care, as joyous and carefree as any</seg><seg type="columnLine">child upon the Outside; more so, I should say, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were no class distinctions, no race prejudices,</seg><seg type="columnLine">110 snobbishness; the same abundance of food, thf</seg><seg type="columnLine">same clothing, toys and play hours. What more</seg><seg type="columnLine">could children want? Love? Could any normal man</seg><seg type="columnLine">or woman help but love the little things? They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">their little friendships, their little loves, the comfort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of each other's arms and guardians who had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind words and loving pats for them. A teacher</seg><seg type="columnLine">who mistreated a child was taken from her charges</seg><seg type="columnLine">and put to other work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEN WITH WINGS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the adults there were their own friendships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their mates, their amusements. A man had a right</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take the woman he loved to mate, but he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">compelled to ta\e her for life. True many a man or</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman took upon themselves a single mate for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their life-time and they were happy in each other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">love and lived their full happy days knowing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the end of the days they would have each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. And there was the pure blue sky and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright sun above into which one could plunge or</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb to the dizzy heights, race with the birds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">look about and survey the world as far as the eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see. He could know that he is the happiest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all creatures on Earth because he possessed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">medium to express his soul's desire . . . wings . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">to climb with the eagle ... to sing with the lark!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Amusements they had, too. There were races run</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the clearings, tournaments held in the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pageants enacted, plays performed. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sing-songs, games, competitive drills. There "were</seg><seg type="columnLine">five holidays in the Mentorian calendar. One marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the birthday of Howard Mentor, their common</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancestor; one for the day on which the Scotch ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">had put to sea; one for the arrival in Brazil; one</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the settlement of present Mentor; one for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">birthday of the reigning Patriarch. On these days</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were opening prayers and no work was done</seg><seg type="columnLine">except such chores as were absolutely necessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Could life be more complete anywhere else on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">the globe?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER SEVEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ready For Work</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a week I was given the freedom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. I wandered down one corridor and up</seg><seg type="columnLine">another; into chamber after chamber, up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steps to the jungle or down to the lower levels</seg><seg type="columnLine">where were the workshops. Here men .and women</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked alike, making cloth, skinning birds, pluck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and sorting feathers, tanning the skins, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">manufacturing all kinds of necessities that were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">purchased from the Outside. There were furniture</seg><seg type="columnLine">shops, mechanical shops, a sugar refinery that</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated the raw sugar as it came from the plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throughout the city were many small swimming</seg><seg type="columnLine">pools distributed on the third level, and here I spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great deal of time in the cool water that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought underground from the rivers hereabouts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The winged people were not very good swimmers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fact, they never went into the water to swim</seg><seg type="columnLine">but rather to bathe. To wet their wings meant many</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours to be spent in drying them. They kept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feathers clean with oil baths, and there were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of chambers devoted to their care just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were the tonsorial parlors to keep their hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beards neatly trimmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 visited the hospital often for Wormley was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">confined and Miss Lois was usually about. She and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had become fast friends. She, I had learned, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cousin of the Patriarch and she was a head nurse</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hospital directing the work of the nurses</seg><seg type="columnLine">under her. There were a good number of doctors</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom Doctor Morris trained; conducting a school</seg><seg type="columnLine">for their benefit. He was kept rather busy traveling</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one hospital to another in the settlements</seg><seg type="columnLine">supervising the work and taking charge of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious cases.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I learned that Mentor was equipped with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephone system so that all the cities were linked</seg><seg type="columnLine">together and there was also a radio hook-up! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Patriarch had a giant receiving set in his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters and often we were given musical concerts</seg><seg type="columnLine">from all over the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost every day new recruits were arriving in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Detention Camp some twenty-five miles beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentor. I could only wonder what this would</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventually bring. It seemed as if the hour had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most struck for Mentor to announce herself to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woftfl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime I knew that my time was grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing short. The usual procedure with the newcomers</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to give them a few days of idleness in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn all they could about the nation of Mentor;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then they were required to state their preference</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the type of work they should like to do best,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more than a week of idleness would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">tolerated. In fact, I was anxious to be up and doing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the enforced idleness was becoming unbearable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially in a world where everyone was busy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Wormley who made a suggestion of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">type of work I1 could accomplish here in the city and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was directed to seek out the Patriarch for his ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">probation. I found him in his quarters which formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hub of the city. I had to wait in an anteroom</seg><seg type="columnLine">until my turn came for an audience. After an hour's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait I was ushered into the presence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The room in which I found the Patriarch was</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnished in Spartan simplicity, a table and three or</seg><seg type="columnLine">four chairs were the only pieces of furniture. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass rug covered the floor and behind the Pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">triarch's chair was the full length portrait of a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom I immediately judged to be Howard Mentor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dark-visaged man with the piercing eyes of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had spent a life-time in realizing an ambition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was dressed in the colorful costume of the six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teenth century.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Patriarch merely nodded his head by way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of recognition when I entered the chamber and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard me through, quietly, as I outlined my plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">for establishing a newspaper by which Mentor</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be informed of all that took place in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">various settlements and what news filtered in from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Outside, f rapidly explained plans for various</seg><seg type="columnLine">departments and for the training of printers, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porters, et cetera.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gimlet eyes bored me through, but somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt an awe for the handsome man. I think I</seg><seg type="columnLine">judged him right, for in him I saw a very human</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with a deep sense of humor as well as honor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had admired him intensely from the start and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now I found I had not placed my regard im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">properly. Here was a man of power who could take</seg><seg type="columnLine">his place in the world among kings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After finished speaking he nodded his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, and his cold hard voice spoke in his rapid</seg><seg type="columnLine">emphatic way.

I was impatient to start</seg><seg type="columnLine">something for time was hanging rather heavily on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hands. I visited and revisited the workshops,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the schools, the playgrounds. I spent a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of time above ground in the clearings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">People went past me as they hurried about their</seg><seg type="columnLine">duties, and only during the hours of recreation</seg><seg type="columnLine">could I mingle freely with them. 1 made the ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quaintance of a number of the captives, girls who</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed happy in their new strange life. I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of them complain, but on the whole it ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared that they were content, or at least had ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cepted their lot with proper spirit. They had all</seg><seg type="columnLine">been given work according to their own interests</seg><seg type="columnLine">and those who had no interests were being taught</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple tasks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were not only female captives, but quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of men who, like the women, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirited away. Several were aviators who like our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves had fallen to the toil of the Machine. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those that had been kidnapped two of them in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terested me the most with their stories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Charlie Broner told the tale of the flying girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had appeared to him in a moonlit garden in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buenos Aires while he strolled trying to sober up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a drinking party. Under the influence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquor he had thought the winged creature an</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagery of his besotted brain and gleefully de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded that she give him a ride in the air. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakened from his stupor to find himself being</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried over a jungle when the sun was dawning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twice he had tried to make his escape from Mentor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but each time had been brought back. Being an</seg><seg type="columnLine">architect by profession he was now employed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">construction of the underground cities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eugene Fargo's tale was of different tinder. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">name was not unknown to me, and I recognized him</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately as a sculptor of great promise. I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">even recall having seen an article in the News</seg><seg type="columnLine">stating that the artist had purchased a cay off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Floridan coast where he planned to work unmo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lested by "lion hunters" that were his pests.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With his negro valet he had sneaked off to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island with several uncompleted pieces of work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One morning as he came down to the water for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his morning plunge he was startled to see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be a gigantic bird barely skimming the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water and struggling with one wing to keep afloat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He watched it struggle nearer, but it was too weak</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at last after a hard battle gave up. its strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, and fell into the water. There it continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight, keeping the one good wing above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Admiring the heroic creature, Fargo called to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">servant to help launch a boat and they rowed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the stricken creature. One can picture their</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder in discovering the bird to be a woman!</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was before the flying men had been dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he had nursed the winged girl back to health.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her wing had been broken in a storm that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried her to his island. She allowed him to model</seg><seg type="columnLine">her in clay, and it is needless to say that the sculp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor fell in love with his model. Her name was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary. She told him the stirring history of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. They were in love, but Mary longed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her jungle home. She tried to prevail upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">artist to accompany her home. She begged that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he come so he might model her people--to teach</seg><seg type="columnLine">them his art. But Fargo refused. He had a small son</seg><seg type="columnLine">and daughter though his wife was dead, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no wish to desert the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wing healed and the girl continued to plead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the man was adamantine. The wing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong again, and the girl took little flights to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strengthen it. Fargo watched each flight fearful</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the girl would fly away, for he loved her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than he loved his wife. He won in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleading to keep her with him another month and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again another month. Pie longed to clip the wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his love, but he was too much a man for that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had a large fortune in trust for his children</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were well cared for by his sister. He al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most made the decision to go, but at the end he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still as uncertain. The day before, Mary de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared she must return to her people and that night</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two fell asleep after many hours of pleading for</seg><seg type="columnLine">each to do his will. That is Fargo fell asleep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not Alary. She must return to Mentor and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man must go with her. She slipped the clay model</seg><seg type="columnLine">of herself in her bosom. There were to be no tale-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell marks left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Fargo awoke with the dawn to find himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound hand and foot more than a thousand feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">above a watery expanse. With night they dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a deserted sandy beach. She fed him fruit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him water, but would not remove his bonds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The next night found them at Mentor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus had Eugene Fargo come to the jungles, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he confessed to me that he was happy that Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken the matter into her hands! He missed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his children, but he was happier than he had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">been before and was doing better work. He had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">school for sculptoring started, in which he taught</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who had a talent. He took me to his work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shop that he had fitted out in the lower branches</seg><seg type="columnLine">of several trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Life In Mentor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE floor was of strong branches interwoven,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leaves his walls, and the sun coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the tree tops gave him his light. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed to his shop by means of a rope unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pupils or Mary were kind enough to carry him</seg><seg type="columnLine">up there. It wa9 a pretty sight of a morning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see half a dozen or so of the winged youth seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a semi-circle around their teacher working with</seg><seg type="columnLine">clay near the city. The Patriarch had ordered some</seg><seg type="columnLine">clay. He had discovered a bed of fine workable</seg><seg type="columnLine">marble to be imported for him to work with, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it would be gruelling work for six winged</seg><seg type="columnLine">men to bring the blocks of stone from afar in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead of night. At present he was working on a full</seg><seg type="columnLine">length figure of the Patriarch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were also other schools for art. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentorites were an artistic people as the paintings</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their walls prove. And the Patriarch seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEN WITH WINGS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to cultivate the Fine Arts among his</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, for he well knew that a civilization has its</seg><seg type="columnLine">foundations in Art.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From time to time I had been seeing Miss Lois</seg><seg type="columnLine">either in the clearings under the trees or in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lounge rooms below. I knew from the very first</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was in love with this beautiful angelic</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature, but I did not know if she harbored a like</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling for me. Kindly, she answered all my ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, told me of her work, advised me and helped</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in whatever way she could. And several times</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was good enough to take me for short flights</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the trees. Once she suggested a tour of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentor for me; and, as she was going with Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morris in a round of inspection of the hospital, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was invited to accompany them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morris was borne aloft by a winged youth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">another was provided for me, and the five of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">went from city to city. Life in the five other</seg><seg type="columnLine">settlements was much the same as in Number One</seg><seg type="columnLine">City. Each were designated by its number.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mentorite is a fine flyer. Their wings are</seg><seg type="columnLine">very powerful--as from childhood they are taught</seg><seg type="columnLine">to develop them. And part of their training is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry heavy burdens as they fly, the weight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">burden increasing with their years so that a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred pound weight is nothing for them to carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">a distance of from five hundred to a thousand miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a long sustained flight!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Endurance contests were encouraged. The longest</seg><seg type="columnLine">sustained flight record among them is for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and fifty hours! On many a fine day it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not an uncommon sight to see a tiny dot high in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky that looks no more than a speck of dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">and know that it is either a man or woman out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">break a record. They carry enough food and</seg><seg type="columnLine">water to last them for a long time. Wearing heavier</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing they climb to tremendous heights, as high</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it is possible for human beings to climb and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">survive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One morning, Lois asked if I should care to wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness the morning drill. I quickly assented. I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">now how to place my weight in a position that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">best for my bearer and, as easily as if I were a child,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broad wings of Lois bore me up through one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the passages to the air above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Early morning over the jungle is pleasant indeed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The air is fresh and keen, and the warm odor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing things fills the air. Lois picked out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable crotch in a big jungle giant from where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could watch the maneuvres as from a ring-side</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat. Thousands of the winged people were al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready abroad, and many more were coming up</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the trees. I would have been glad to climb</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Lois to the sun that morning, but with a smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a wave she left me in my seat as she hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to join her fellows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were other spectators beside myself. Later</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Lois showed me that many of the trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hung with giant vines and also ropes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been camouflaged in such a manner as to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the living vines. By this means the Earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound might climb to the lowest branches of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rees and from there he would find steps leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward, small ladders of interwoven branches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">•\fter discovering that, I spent a great deal of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Drill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEAR me today was seated a captive, like my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, who was familiar with all the features of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drill and pointed out to me the more interesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">exercises. He was a youth scarcely eighteen, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty as a girl. He had come to Mentor when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was but twelve years old.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pointed out the eight sentinels stationed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eight points of the compass. They had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">their places several thousand feet up in the sky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were the outlooks and would warn the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panies below of the approach of aircraft. Once in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a while we see an aeroplane far off in the sky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Usually, however, we were warned of its arrival</seg><seg type="columnLine">long before it could be seen and under pain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death we were forced to hide ourselves in the trees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One could only recall the fate of the woman we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen from the plane on the day we had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for Mentor to be sure not to desire a like</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The winged men and women were now gather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into squads and companies, and at the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a sharp whistle a line was formed in the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">as neatly as an infantry could on the ground--as</seg><seg type="columnLine">battalion after battalion took its place. I marveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the dexterity with which the flying people mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the air. It was a marvelous sight when all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the companies had fallen into place and, with wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">outstretched, maintained themselves in one position</seg><seg type="columnLine">as easily as a man stands upright on his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How brilliant that scene was in the bright tropic</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight, with the variegated shining wings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">every hue and color known to the birds. I noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that each company was made up of those whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings were of one color. The first company were</seg><seg type="columnLine">all white winged, the second black, the third golden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fourth red, the fifth green, the sixth blue and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">on through the natural colors and on into those</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose wings were of various color combinations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Last and most beautiful were those of the rain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed wings, and among them was Miss Lois who</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranked a captain!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the sound of a second whistle all was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">still, and I saw that the Patriarch had arrived. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">took his place in front of the first company. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wearing a costume of snowy white and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a striking creature with his great black wings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He now blew his whistle and the companies</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to rigid attention, their bodies stiffened, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings quivering under the tension. Immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">two blasts of the whistle shrilled out and with it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a roar that was almost deafening. Thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand pairs of wings were beating the air as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flyers arose, company after company, straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the heavens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never was a company of soldiers better trained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every body was as straight and as motionless as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ramrod; each man kept his distance from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion as if the distance had been measured</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a yardstick. Rising, they looked as if they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never halt again; until finally the whistle sounded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Immediately the battalions broke order, half their</seg><seg type="columnLine">number flying rapidly in one direction, the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opposite. A thousand yards apart they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a halt and we could see that they had separated</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to the colors of their wings, the solid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hued wings on one side, the variegated upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SX'Jif</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            ^\&gt;.

In one concerted rush, 50,000 flying men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">              and women took to the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">78</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEN WITH WINGS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">79</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the whistle, and the two parties were gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanized into action. With a great roar of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings and with equal speed the two contingents</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed directly for each other so that it appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if there was to be a head-on collision. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">met and now we were treated to a sight that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">intensely stirring, an aerial sham-battle. Their only</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon was a small blunt stick that was brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a pocket. Its tip was chalked with red. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">trick appeared to be in parrying with one's op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponent until one or the other was marked by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red stick. The stricken one immediately dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the battle. And such flying there was, such</seg><seg type="columnLine">banking, such whirling, such spins, such spirals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such flying as never before witnessed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The battle lasted no more than ten minutes, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">after another of the vanquished falling out Until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees were literally covered with them as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched for the end. A roar went up when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Patriarch's snowy bosom was marked with red!</seg><seg type="columnLine">No more than two thousand were left in the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the whistle shrilled again. The majority of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those remaining in the air had variegated wings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a few hundred of the solid colored remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloft. The victory was given to the former.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At times, my informant told me that there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">battles between male and female and although the</seg><seg type="columnLine">male predominated to a great degree the female</seg><seg type="columnLine">contingents often won.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the companies again took their places in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, and there followed a half hour of drill with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge body moving as one man, turning, twisting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping, soaring, charging and retreating. I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">again the formation of the circle as each man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman scattered at a command and flew outward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and upward until a tremendous circle was formed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a circle of five ranks rising higher and higher.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the drill was done Miss Lois came for me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carried me to the ground again. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely winded from the trial. She left me as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried to her duties in the hospital.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER EIGHT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Takes A Mate</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DAYS went by and yet I received no orders</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Patriarch. The fact that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed to remain idle pointed to the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusion that he was still considering my application</seg><seg type="columnLine">to organize a news sheet; but I could only wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Patriarch's procrastination. I could see no</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for him to hesitate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By now I knew all the ins and outs of the city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twice I made a half-hearted attempt to escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing beforehand the futility of such a course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was thwarted each time. I spent a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal of time with Wormley who was still wailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his leg to heal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And one day a summons came. I had been called</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the Patriarch! I was all a-quiver, but the cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">visage of the black-winged man chilled me. ''Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kennedy," said he, "I have learned that twice you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made an attempt to leave bounds! Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason, please!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shrugged my shoulders. "I was merely seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof, sire," I answered as laconically as I could.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I saw that my answer was an almost imper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptible smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The second charge against you . . is that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been with us . . . five weeks . . . yet you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">not performed the first duty that is expected of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you! And that is to take to yourself a mate."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again I shrugged my shoulders. "The women of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentor are all beautiful," I said lamely, thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of the beauty of Miss Lois.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All the more reason you should have chosen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentor has a purpose in the world, and it is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty of every man and woman within her gates</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do what he or she can to further our work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he who shirks that duty is of no use to us!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our way of dealing with such as you ... is simple.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since you do not choose for yourself, we choose</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He clapped his hands shortly.

She is of a direct</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of eight generations of the alated, and because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the strength of her blood you are commanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take her to mate in hope that you can bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth a child that is worthy of Mentor! Let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear differently and things will go hard with you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I listened wordlessly to the harangue. The man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold-blooded eugenic creed disgusted me and I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I should stand up for my rights as a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tell him what I thought of him and his noxious</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctrine, only the presence of the girl standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly by, held me back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seething within I demanded, "Has Miss Lois</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to say to this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man must have read my feelings in my face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for the first time I saw a true smile on his lips.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lois has already announced the fact that she is</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite willing to accept you, Jim Kennedy. In that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are to be complimented."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I don't know what emotion swept me then. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly elated and at the same time greatly em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barassed. I stole a glance at the girl's face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was not looking at me nor appeared embar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rassed in any way. Such procedure was the rule</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Mentor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Concluding that the interview was over I waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">only for the word of dismissal. Yet the Patriarch</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Today." he stated, "a shipment from Cuzco has</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived. In Section Three of the third level you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will find all the necessary equipment for the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have asked to carry out. You are permitted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">choose what youths you will need in your project.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We shall expect weekly reports from you and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall require that you confer with me on the policy</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I wish you to pursue. That is all now. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">may retire!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So that was the way the Patriarch did things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My heart suddenly grew warm. I took several</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps forward and stretched out my hand. Pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">triarch Mentor took it and we clasped hands hearti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. It was the beginining of our friendship!</seg><seg type="columnLine">80</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside his chambers I faced Miss Lois who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompanied me. I did not know just what to say.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She looked at me and smiled gently. "Our methods</seg><seg type="columnLine">are strange to you. Jim Kennedy? I know from</seg><seg type="columnLine">what Howard Wormley tells me that you do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">go about such matters on the Outside as we do</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I admitted as much, but I hurried on to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">her that my feelings had always been directed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her ever since I had first seen her; that I loved her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my reticence was due only to the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I feared she did not feel the same toward me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And Becomes Acquainted With Her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE blushed prettily and then declared that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had loved me the minute they had brought my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mangled body to her. She went on to tell me of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours she spent at my bedside when it was thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would die, and the tears she had shed! Wormley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said, had known all along! You may be sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that 1 made up my mind to tell him just what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of him for not having warned me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now," said she in a tone that was strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter-of-fact for the occasion, "I suppose you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to see the machineries they have brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She led me through the corridors down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower level and into the rooms where my news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper was to take life. The delight I had expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to feel when I should first realize I had a printing</seg><seg type="columnLine">press under my hand was not there. Instead I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to runaway somewhere with this Earthly</seg><seg type="columnLine">angel, hold her in my arms and tell her how much</seg><seg type="columnLine">I adored her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead I pretended enthusiasm in the presses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could never rival the great New York dailies, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would be able to work out a fairly good weekly</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper on the shiny new machinery that awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Everything was there to the smallest detail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the conventional mats and great rolls of paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for use. I had to admit that Patriarch Mentor</seg><seg type="columnLine">did things in a big way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three fairly large chambers had been set aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me and with the aid of six husky fellows we</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed everything to my satisfaction, the various</seg><seg type="columnLine">presses, the heavy rollers, and the bundle machine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By trade I am only a reporter, but I had learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">my profession in the hard grind of a country news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper and knew printing from pi to em! I arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">a desk of rough wood under a bright light, placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it one of the three brand new typewriters, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stack of paper, pencils and what-not in prepara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the work to come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The luncheon bell rang ere we were quite fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished placing everything. Lois had returned to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">own work after directing me to the offices, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found her in the common lounge awaiting me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heretofore she had lived and eaten her meals in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hospital quarters, but I discovered that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had her place changed so that henceforth we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be together during the dining hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was so sweet and unspoiled, so natural in</seg><seg type="columnLine">what seemed to me such an unnatural position,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that her very attitude made it easier for me. Still</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not have any appetite for the food put before</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and I was glad when the meal ended and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have an hour or so in which to become</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquainted, for I realized that I knew very little</seg><seg type="columnLine">about this young lady.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We took a settee in the lounge and we talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout the hour. Lois wanted to know more</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the Outside, what was marriage, how were</seg><seg type="columnLine">courtships conducted as well as a great many other</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. She liked the thought of a couple setting</seg><seg type="columnLine">up house-keeping together, but she had nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say against Mentorian methods. When the gong</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced the end of the hour she shyly agreed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet me after the working period.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps Patriarch Mentor was laughing at me</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing full well how difficult it was for a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">to serve two masters at once, ambition and love!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I surely accomplished very little in the hours that</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed. I sat there at my desk contemplating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stack of paper--for first off I had planned to lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the set-up for the front-sheet of my paper. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as I went was to write at the top the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was to be known by, the Aerial</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the ringing of the gong I found Lois at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot she had designated for our tryst and she con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fided that she had something to show me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed her along a path I had never been on</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, and after walking rapidly we came to halt</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a giant tree. She pointed out that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow her up the rope that hung from the lowest</seg><seg type="columnLine">branch. She went up quickly and easily, I more</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up we climbed the little ladders that were barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong enough for my weight, but up which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl went as lightly as a bit of thistle. Scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten feet below the roof of the jungle we halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she showed me a pretty little nook that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been constructed of interwoven branches. A cushion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of feathers covered the rough floor. And, only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few slender branches overhead, hid the platform</seg><seg type="columnLine">from above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She blushed as she confessed, "When I was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">child I built this little hide-out myself. Here, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">now come often when I feel 1 wish to be alone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Could we not call this our . . . house . . . our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own . . . Jim Kennedy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ah, the sweetness of her and the pity, for though</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was of a people who had lived a communal life</seg><seg type="columnLine">for almost five centuries the desire for something</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her own was still in her and had spoken to her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There for the first time I took her in my arms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kissed her. I can say no more of the love that</seg><seg type="columnLine">welled in me for her. it is hard to write of it, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I loved her then as I shall always love her, I, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard-boiled reporter fellow!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And Goes to Work</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE did not stay long in our little love nest</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I thought of it thereafter, for our rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">period was of but an hour's duration before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drill--but we did come back again and again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were only the bright-plumed birds and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beady-eyed monkeys to tell of those hours. Often</seg><seg type="columnLine">we took flights from there up into the blue of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skies or into the wonder of the silvery nights. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first strangeness of being carried in her arms wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">off and I learned by proxy what it meant to fly . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">to really fly as the birds fly without the deadening</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of motors or the breath of burning oil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So life in Mentor started for me with a bang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Never again did I think of escaping. Poor Sims</seg><seg type="columnLine">can wait for his story. The next weeks overflowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seemed all too short. I was peopling my offic«</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEN WITH WINGS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">81</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with printers, clerks and printer's devils. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">training reporters and columnists. Lottie Walker,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a captive woman, became my women's correspond-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent. She had been a reporter on a Chicago paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she became invaluable to me. Another Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ican girl, Wanda Heath, became a reporter. Eugene</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fargo agreed to write an article each week about</seg><seg type="columnLine">art. I found a music critic and a sports writer!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had an interview with the Patriarch and he out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lined the policy of the Aerial, the name of which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">approved. And two weeks after the arrival of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presses we came out with our first edition! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed when I thought of what the T^euis would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have said of it. It was crude; my printers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">none too efficient and my staff needed much train-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, but at worst it was not so bad and gave promise</seg><seg type="columnLine">of improvement. It had only one double sheet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all news, of course, for what had we of Mentor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">advertise? The Patriarch was quite enthusiastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it and laughed heartily over a caricature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself that had been drawn by an art student. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that I must introduce one or two chaps to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the art of comic-strips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But wait .... I am not writing this narrative to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell of my own exploits and triumphs, there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">other things that were taking place in Mentor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From time to time planes had been sighted hover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing around and about Mentor. Several planes fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Mentor's toils and the pilots, who survived the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall to the great sheet of metal that was reared up</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the jungle to receive them, were added to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swelling population. They took their places as we all</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done, and none seemed irked by their enforced</seg><seg type="columnLine">incarceration. As time wore on some of the bolder</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirits did make attempts to escape, but they never</seg><seg type="columnLine">got far away, nor were they punished for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempts unless they proved too persistent. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to them, when they disappeared from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranks, none of us knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By means of our radio we knew that those of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Outside were anxious for revenge upon the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">with wings. Several flying men had been captured</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they became too daring in the matter of ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ductions. Of course they had been given the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">degree and South Americans were not adverse to</seg><seg type="columnLine">torturing them in an attempt to learn from whence</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had come, their number and their ultimate in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentions. But to date not a single captured Men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torite had divulged the secret of his race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We knew, however, that the Americans were</seg><seg type="columnLine">planning to descend upon the jungle in the area</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it was conjectured the alated had their base,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to wipe it from the map. The tropical rains</seg><seg type="columnLine">came and we had that interim in which to prepare--</seg><seg type="columnLine">had their been any preparations to be made. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I learned Mentor was already prepared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER NINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ready For Battle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE six weeks of rain that followed was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">as unpleasant a time to us in the underground</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities as it might be expected. However, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people were rather cooped up during those long</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours when the heavens poured incessantly down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the jungles. Still the cities were dry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many happy hours were spent in the lounges.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everyone did his best to entertain his fellow so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hours did not seem long.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were plays enacted in the big assembly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms of the city, indoor games played. Musicians</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought out their instruments to entertain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowds and of course we had the radio.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the days when the sun shone, there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">general exodus as everyone hurried into its warmth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wings were spread again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime I was making great progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my paper, discovering new talent, widening</seg><seg type="columnLine">my range. I now had correspondents in each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cities, and we had our own telephone switch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board to receive the incoming news. We had three</seg><seg type="columnLine">comic strips, and we ran a column of jokes as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a weekly story written by one of our coming au-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thors. Patriarch Mentor complimented me on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work we were doing, for it could be seen that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspaper was bringing the scattered settlements</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer together than ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wormley had since been discharged from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospital and during those weeks while it rained he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made great progress with the Mentorite women.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had gotten his wish and had been detailed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work at one of the Aero-electrovoid Bases of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were six stationed at distant points around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentor. These tremendous machines that brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the planes worked on a very simple plan. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean of great generators the dust was ionized</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the air was sucked out of the locality above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cities. So powerful were they that any object</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the way would immediately be swung around</seg><seg type="columnLine">and around and finally sucked into the maw of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What Wormley had suggested that day in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospital, then, was astonishingly correct. Over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine was erected a great heavy plate of sheet</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal of large proportions. This could be raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the time of need above the trees to catch the fall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing plane and to protect the machine beneath. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal sheet was then lowered and tilted so that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrecked plane would slide off into a pit dug below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole machine itself was built in a pit below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground and when not in action was completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered and the area over and around it made to</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear as if it had never been touched by human</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wormley's work was to do with the mechanics</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the engine, repairing it keeping it in readiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">for what was to come. I could not understand his</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire to be part of such destruction, but human</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature is a funny thing after all, and perhaps he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw humour in nursing the infernal thing. I knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, he was studying its construction possibly with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hope that some day he might escape and give</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From a word the Patriarch dropped one day I</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined that he understood Wormley's intention,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he himself enjoyed the joke, at the same time</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping a heavy guard on the "captive". Wormley</seg><seg type="columnLine">did attempt to make an escape one day, months</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, and he paid for it with his life. That caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a good deal of pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the day did arrive when our friends on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Outside made an attempt to conquer the mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">auding winged men. That day the twenty-fifth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of July will go down into history to be remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">many years hence. And it was the events of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">day that forced the world to respect the power of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentor!</seg><seg type="columnLine">82</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had already been appraised of the attack that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be made and consequently waited anxiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the outcome. How utterly were those fleets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred and fifty planes beaten! How like</seg><seg type="columnLine">toys they fell into the power of the Patriarch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although we were forewarned no precautions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken by the Mentorites. Until the hour had almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck, the business of living went about as ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. Only when the gong struck eleven o'clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the morning, did it appear as if anything was</seg><seg type="columnLine">afoot. Orders were given for every able-bodied</seg><seg type="columnLine">winged man and women to gather above the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a moment's delay. No one else was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the cities on pain of death! An Earthbound</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered above the ground would die on the spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For us all work was suspended and we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered to gather in the lounges and stay there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How inglorious I felt herded in a room while Lois,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wife, went to join the legions. I even envied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wormley then, in his work beside the Aero-electro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">void. I, as editor-in-chief of the Aerial should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have at least been an eye-witness of that conflict.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead I was forced to hear the results of the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">by word of mouth. John, one of my reporters, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">took his place in the ranks had the extreme pleasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of writing the dramatic story and all I could do was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to edit it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Battle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WORD had come to us that the two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fifty planes had set out from Cuzco and</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be expected around noon. Half an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the hour we heard the roar of the motors</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they drew near. Spread out in a giant circle the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hundred and eighty thousand or so winged</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors waiting quietly in the trees hidden from</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight. Each officer of the companies was provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a radio receiving set small enough to be carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his belt. Orders came from headquarters in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentor where the Patriarch waited, stationed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees. The six electrovoid machines were already</seg><seg type="columnLine">warming up, but had not yet begun their work</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sucking down the upper atmosphere over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">area of Mentor. Let the enemy drop all the bombs</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wished, but not one of them would ever strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">their goal, their explosions would only wreck havoc</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wild unpopulated jungles becoming boomer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">angs to the very man who had tossed them!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Down in Number One city we knew when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes arrived for they immediately took their</seg><seg type="columnLine">station directly over our city. On arriving over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot, the planes had gathered together about five</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet above the trees, then at a command</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their commander began to spread into a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle. For a short time they stayed poised over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, awaiting no doubt some sort of development</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the jungle, but it lay quietly sleeping in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot noon sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then several scout ships dropped low and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">zooming over the trees. They could see nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was of interest, and we in the lounge rooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard their reports as they radioed to their com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mandant. Evidently the Outside was unaware of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that we had radio. Our battalions of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">used a code.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> More planes began dropping lower and it could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seen that they were getting into a formation so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they might throw bombs down upon the sea</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of trees. Now for the first time Mentor acted. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines began their work, and the enemy were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not aware until two of the scout planes commenced</seg><seg type="columnLine">acting strangely and their pilots broadcast wildly</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was happening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately the battalions above began to draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside, but 110 matter in what direction they turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the danger was upon them, and one after another</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planes began to fall out of control! The six</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines had complete control of the air for sixty</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles around and there was 110 telling how high</seg><seg type="columnLine">their power could be felt, for naturally as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew the upper air in from one area there was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">more to fill its place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The air overhead was losing its light as the elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trically-charged ionized-dust atmosphere could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">conduct the light of the sun as directly as hereto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore. And plane after plane was beginning to crash</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the metal plates. Some of the planes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to discharge their supply of bombs, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they went the same way as the planes and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequently many of the planes went up into flames</seg><seg type="columnLine">ere they struck the barrier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In less than ten minutes after the beginning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fight almost a hundred planes had succumbed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and those who had warily risen higher and higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovered above the earth uncertain where to turn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They could be seen turning and moving out in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">directions as they attempted to find an area that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was free from menace. A number did reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outskirts of that great "hole" only to be caught in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whirlpools formed in the outer spaces by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific suction that was exerted. And they too fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seeing what had happened to their fellows the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred or so planes that were left, now took to</seg><seg type="columnLine">circling about within the sixty mile circle fearful</seg><seg type="columnLine">of going lower and fearful of being caught by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirlpools. It was then that Patriarch Mentor gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">command to the waiting companies outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In one concerted rush fifty thousand flying men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and women took to the air rising straight up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens wherein the remaining "enemy" were</seg><seg type="columnLine">circling, still uncertain. The planes saw them com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Here at last was a tangible enemy to fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They gathered into formation and awaited the on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming flying men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have mentioned earlier that I knew of no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">destructive weapon possessed by the Mentorites</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside of the Machines, but I discovered they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not unprepared to do battle. They knew electricity</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps better than the world. We have had</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists who have made for themselves thunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolts, but as yet 110 use had ever been discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">for them. The Mentorites did have a use for them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each man and woman carried a small stick, harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less enough looking, but harmless it was not; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">each "stick" had within its barrel six discharges,</seg><seg type="columnLine">discharges of electricity that could travel a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand feet, and with each discharge of a thunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolt a plane fell. That had been the reason for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">practice battles with red marked wands!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten planes went down under the spitting of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunderbolts before the two parties drew together,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but now the aeroplanes were in the midst of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyers, and the machine guns were being turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the flying men. A few of them fell, but their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranks were scarcely touched, for the pilots busily</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEN WITH WINGS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">83</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to keep out of the way of the flashes from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "thunder sticks" were not giving their gunners</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very good chance to direct their fire and those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who fell were shot down only by stray bullets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were always right on the tail of the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines and on that day they proved how much more</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficient were living wings to those of cloth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel. Less than fifty planes now remained as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell one after another in smoke and fire, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had learned their lesson and were climbing higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">and higher so that the flying creatures were below</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Thunderbolts continued to flash and several</seg><seg type="columnLine">more planes went into tail spins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A number of the flying men fell because by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time the gunners could take more careful aim upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whirling twisting bodies, and by holding their</seg><seg type="columnLine">position high above the earth in the full glare of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun they were able to shoot the winged creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">down one by one as they darted hither and thither</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempting to shoot their bolts into the vital parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the machines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet as each man fell there was another to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">his place. The airplane force had no reinforce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, they had shot their bow and by now their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuel must have been very low. And they were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven back beyond the range of Mentor. More of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flying creatures arose from the trees. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy was forced to acknowledge defeat. Below</seg><seg type="columnLine">were freshei troops taking formation in readiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a new attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dropping a tew remaining bombs; and with as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much dignity as they could muster, in close forma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion the thirty-odd air planes moved west. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned later that several dozens were forced down</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the jungles because of the lack of fuel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So ended the First Battle of Mentor!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the work of the hospital corps began. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">little less than a hundred of our people had fallen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and only thirty-five of them were fatally wounded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others having suffered only from flesh wounds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A few had been killed outright as they fell atop the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal sheets above the machines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Most of the enemy pilots and gunners had died,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but some still lived and these were brought in to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be cared for. The dead were gathered together and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cremated. The pits around the machines were</seg><seg type="columnLine">piled high with the wreckage of the two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes. Much of the jungle round about had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely demolished, but the cities of Mentor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been touched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We scarcely slept that night. There was moaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sobbing over the deaths of our people. I and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my staff worked the night through to bring out</seg><seg type="columnLine">an extra, and' with early morning the couriers flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the papers to the other settlements. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great deal of rejoicing in the settlements, for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been proven that Mentor could overcome her</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, we did not know what the result would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been if it were not for the Machines. Still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were to learn that at a later period. The world</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows now that the Mentorites are invincible, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have learned to respect the nation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER TEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Life Continues in Mentor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SCOUTS were now stationed as look-outs day</seg><seg type="columnLine">and night, for we had fear of a second attack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although our spies Outside reported that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy had not yet rallied from their ignominious</seg><seg type="columnLine">defeat. Still public opinion ran high, and North</seg><seg type="columnLine">America was demanding that Mentor be wiped off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the map. It was now estimated that we were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">million strong, and they had no way of telling just</seg><seg type="columnLine">how wide an area we covered. The returning planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reported the locations of the machines, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was evident that the next attack would be made</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Plans were being made to establish bases in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle lands, for it had been proven that the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes needed a port closer to the scene of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle. America and Canada were both mobilizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">troops, and airplanes were being hastily built.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And while all these preparations were being made</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Outside, Mentor continued on with her busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of living. Our new recruits were being ini-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiated into our manner of living, babies were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">born, settlements enlarged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I made it a point to visit the fifty-odd aviators</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had survived the wrecking of their planes at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Detention Camp. They all expressed their ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miration for their captors, and were intensely in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terested in the progress of the nation. On being</seg><seg type="columnLine">freed from the Camp they quickly accepted their</seg><seg type="columnLine">new life, and many of them appeared highly con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tented with their lot and expressed the hope that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we should not be attacked again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One, Harry Mellor, a Canadian, approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Patriarch with the plan for the construction of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of bombing planes to combat the enemy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Patriarch did not approve the notion. He ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted that his ancestors had not conceived the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that man should ever rise in the air in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanical devices, but he saw no reason for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">offspring to take to machinery. He meant to prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the world that wings were an improvement over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The task of bringing new women to Mentor per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted. but the abductors were more cautious and</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked only by night. Too, they had to travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">further and further for their prey. There were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more spectacular aerial kidnappings or hotel scares.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flying for hundreds of miles, sometimes as far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the border states of the United States, the mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">auders abided their time alighting as a rule near</seg><seg type="columnLine">some outlying post where from previous observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion they had discovered the woman of their choice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There they would await her coming. Swooping</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly down upon her, burying her cries in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">muffler they bore off with her not halting till they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The world was more uproarious than ever in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their demands that the criminals be punished. Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">many were turning out Zeppelins and planes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being rushed across the Atlantic. England</seg><seg type="columnLine">was also aroused, and even France and Italy were</seg><seg type="columnLine">incensed although the Mentorites did not molest</seg><seg type="columnLine">their peoples.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the settlements of the winged people, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, war appeared forgotten. The Arts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being pursued avidly by the youths of the nation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">84</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A writing club had been organized and gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">together weekly to discuss their writings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">methods. New plays were being written and acted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I often printed the stories of these authors. Eugene</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moore was making great progress with his Art</seg><seg type="columnLine">school. He had been driven to take rooms in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city because of the growth of the school and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine pieces of work were turned out. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">many other schools of endeavor besides those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Art--mechanics, electrical and architectural, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were all making progress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I now added a sporting page to my paper. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused as much attention as the sport's section in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a New York daily. The endurance tests for flyers</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued. The record for staying aloft in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot above the city was for fifty-two hours, forty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">three minutes and ten seconds for male, and forty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine hours, twenty-seven minutes and fifty-two</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds for female. This was apart from the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">sustained flights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Weekly contests were held for different types of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying, the winner receiving a prize as well as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high regard of his race. There were contests for</seg><seg type="columnLine">children in which they were classed according to</seg><seg type="columnLine">age. These races did much in teaching the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">valuable lessons of endurance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We did not confine ourselves to flying contests</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. There were the ground games for the flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">people as well as the Earthbound, a type of base-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball, basket ball and marbles in which the adults as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as the children took great pleasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A New Mentorian</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE still kept in touch with the Outer world</seg><seg type="columnLine">by radio, and I printed all the news that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came over it. Several bases were being built in</seg><seg type="columnLine">various localities. One was on a plateau of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andes on the Peruvian border, another in Bolivia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a third on the Amazon River. Our scouts flying by</seg><seg type="columnLine">night watched the progress that was being made.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Infantry was being brought into the jungles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads constructed. Artillery was also being brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">in at the cost of tremendous labor, and the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">was becoming overrun by airplanes and Zeppelins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of us in Mentor wondered that the Pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">triarch did nothing; why he was content to allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enemy to build its big army of offense. Most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Mentorites, however, were as phlegmatic as</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ruler, and to our protest that something should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be done, shrugged their shoulders and averred that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter rested in the Patriarch's hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went so far as to approach him and ask what</seg><seg type="columnLine">this inaction was going to mean.

We will</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead give them the rope and then do the hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing . . . Bridges are to be crossed only when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to them." He smiled wryly. "I should sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gest," he added, "that you write an editorial on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rains came again before our enemy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to strike, and it was during that time that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy Junior, as Lois insisted on naming him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was born. The day he arrived almost became one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of mourning for me, for Lois, the dear little mother,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost died in giving him life. But Doctor Morris</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved her as he had saved many mothers, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were both to look with joy and pride on the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect specimen of alate babyhood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The nurses were profuse in their admiration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. They were not cooing over his appearance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he was like all babies, and even I, the proud</seg><seg type="columnLine">father, could not say that the little red creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">was different. It was his wings that held their</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention, for never had there been born a babe</seg><seg type="columnLine">with such wings, wings that already were longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the fat little youngster himself, and gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise of a growth that had never been seen be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore. The soft fuzz thas covered them was a downy</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow, although in the sun's glow we could detect</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faintest tint of what were later to be white and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the third day of his birth the Patriarch con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">descended to pay him a visit and congratulated Lois</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the fine baby she had given to Mentor. A month</seg><seg type="columnLine">later he was feted by all of Mentor and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy to see that Jimmy Jr. was going to be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride of the nation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One might stop to question the thoughts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">father as he realizes that he had in truth fathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a monstrosity--for such the baby would be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered in 'unwinged' circles. Yet I was so happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the presence of my little family, in my work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my new life that such an idea never ocurred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. In fact, I was so wholly of Mentor that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">seldom or ever that I thought in the terms of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. It was not until later years when I presented</seg><seg type="columnLine">my son to my family in the States that I felt any</seg><seg type="columnLine">discomfiture in his strange appearance. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by that time he was a handsome child with a body</seg><seg type="columnLine">that matched the splendor of his giant wings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now to return to the Mentorian situation. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rains ceased, and airplanes and fighting men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming into the jungle in hordes. Word came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us from our emissaries that within two weeks time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the twelfth of the month, the day had been set</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the concerted attack on Mentor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not until on the eve of the twelfth that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Patriarch struck, and so forceful was the blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gave the world, that they had reason to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were reckoning with a power that could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be crushed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At noon the order went out that the flying men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to gather above the trees immediately after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening meal, and they were to carry six</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunderbolt wands apiece. These were distributed</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them before they took to the air. Mentor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on its toes. There was to be action at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next order came for the Earthbound. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to be separated into companies, and by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick march they were hurried to the boundaries</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mentor, in every direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A small number of Earthbound were to stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the cities, to care for the children, to guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Captives, for no chance was to be allowed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of them escaping. A detail of winged women</seg><seg type="columnLine">were also left to guard each settlement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Decisive Victory</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LOIS was not called out, for mothers of babes</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to six months old were not required for</seg><seg type="columnLine">service.

Thousands of air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes were demolished that night, the artillery was</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely wrecked and there were thousands left</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead and dying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What airplanes managed to take to the air were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrecked and went up in smoke before they had so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as fired a single shot. Zeppelins exploded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and added terror to the awful carnage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The infantry that had already been making its way</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the jungles under the cover of night were</seg><seg type="columnLine">met by the Earthbound and entirely routed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of them, captured, helped to swell the popula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of Mentor. However, several thousand Earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound died in those battles, for they did not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the advantage of wings or of machine guns. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">infantry made a name for themselves that night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even, though in the end they were forced to retreat</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the thunderbolts entirely demoralized them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the morning all fight was driven out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">invaders, and once again Mentor was declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">victor. The world cried out in chagrin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a week following, we of Mentor were busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">with our wounded. All day and night our people</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked in the jungles to save the living and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bury the dead. It was left for Mother Nature to</seg><seg type="columnLine">heal the raw wounds that had been inflicted on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">forests.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The world was now in turmoil. The newspapers</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out with editorials against the winged people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for they saw a new scourge sweeping the planet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even Asia was touched by it.

In any other part of the globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">all might not have gone so well with them, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">here they had control of an area of many hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of square miles about, an area that was a natural</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">protection since the enemy had difficulty in securing</seg><seg type="columnLine">any footing. The Indians were also our friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for they saw in this new race a savior who would</seg><seg type="columnLine">give them their own again. In fact, large tribes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them were drawing close to Mentor and offering</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves to the Mentorites. They did much in</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping us informed of all that the enemy did</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the jungles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Word next came that an attempt was going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be made on Mentor with poisonous gases, but again</seg><seg type="columnLine">ere they could begin this new attack the Mentorites</seg><seg type="columnLine">were upon them, and every city that had received</seg><seg type="columnLine">a supply of gases was attacked at night, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply was bombarded so that the cities them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves felt the attack, and cried out against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">governments to stop bringing any more of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombs into the strongholds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Startling Proposal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT LAST the day came when Mentor sent out</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders to his emissaries to begin negotiations</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the World Court for recognition of the Nation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mentor.

And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went on to advise, that if his demands were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted Mentor would hereafter take the offensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the World would regret its refusal of Mentor!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To me it appeared a very audacious step for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">people of less that a million to take. Yet they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved time and time again their strength, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that Mentor meant what she said. In our</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratories our scientists had discovered a gas that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more potent than even cacodyl isocyanide the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas that had been discovered some fifteen years</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier and which destroyed any life it touched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another year went by, and in that time the World</seg><seg type="columnLine">Court had come to no decision, for the world still</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamored for our destruction. Again attempts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">made upon us with plane and gases, but again</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentor thwarted every move. And to prove that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had meant what she had said a small contingent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of winged men clothed entirely in a sheath of pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tection headed for Cuzco. They went armed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas bombs, and the morning found the city black</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scarred with not a living creature within its</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A cry of distress went up from South America</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this time the World Court acquiesced. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">representatives went out from Mentor with a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard armed with thunderbolts and bombs. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed in Washington D. C. and with an armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard proceeded to the Capital. There were de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrations in the city as the Americans fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach the enemy and tear them limb from limb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the United States had offered them protection</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that they might confer with the President.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The result of that conference was that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">representatives embarked on an air-Iiner for Europe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where they flew on to Geneva, Switzerland, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the World Court was then in session.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brazilian representatives were there also and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought against the usurping of such a large area</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their nation by the Mentorites.

However, bpundaries were laid, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentorite representative signed an agreement that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentor would not overreach her borders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">86</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took almost five years for the world to forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">her animosity toward Mentor, and during that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying people were not welcome in any of the cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world. But gradually the antagonism wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, and it was not an uncommon sight to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winged people in the cities of Quito, Rio de Janeiro,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buenos Aires as well as in American and European</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Mentor was now coming out into the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. The giants of the jungle were being torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, and the cities were rising above ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fine buildings were reared and the nation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming into her own. She had been allotted an</seg><seg type="columnLine">area of one hundred miles wide and two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">long.

I saw that Patriarch Mentor, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now nearing his sixtieth year was growing restless</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the limitations of his country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was now very close to him, for our friendship</seg><seg type="columnLine">had deepened with the years, and I knew that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was looking for Jimmy Jr. to take his place when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would succumb to old age. Jimmy had grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">handsomer with the years. He topped the Patriarch</seg><seg type="columnLine">by an inch in height, and his tremendous wings far</seg><seg type="columnLine">surpassed those of the ruler. In walking they</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged almost two feet behind him and had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread of over sixteen feet. He held the present</seg><seg type="columnLine">record of Mentor, having flown entirely around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth in a little over fifteen days!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I now went to the Patriarch with the plan I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had in mind for several years. He agreed with me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in another generation Mentor would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to stay within her boundaries, that eventually</seg><seg type="columnLine">she must seek new territories. At first he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired with the idea of seeking that territory in</seg><seg type="columnLine">North America, but eventually I convinced him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that America was the only feasible part of the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he could hope to find succor, a country that</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all its two hundred million or so of population</seg><seg type="columnLine">had vast lands scarcely touched. And after hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">of deliberation the Patriarch called upon his coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellors to discuss the question with them. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end it was decided to send emissaries to Washing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton to ask that we be allowed to come into Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can territory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I	shall not go into detail as to what this request</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought about in the two years that followed, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it took all of that time to convince America that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was for her own good to let us in. The President</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Patriarch had many conferences on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question in Cuba where they both met, and it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">needless to say that the President was fired with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought of what it would one day mean to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States were she to allow this strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">race to become citizens of her country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the people of the United States were told</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the decision that had been made they rose up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms and declared they would have nothing to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the measure and demanded that it should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">given no consideration. They still recalled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of women who had been sacrificed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentor, and had become angered when Mentor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">refused to give them up when she had been accepted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the World Court. However, many of the women</seg><seg type="columnLine">and men had been given the right to return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own people since, and most of them had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused although they often visited their home land.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Too, many of the women had given their lives in</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing into the world the winged babies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still the President and Congress still played with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea of admitting the Mentorites into the coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try. Doctor Morris had been closeted with several</seg><seg type="columnLine">renowned heads of the medical profession and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced them that it would be possible to breed</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings on all those who expressed a wish to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">through with the experiment, and already several</seg><seg type="columnLine">such experiments had been made and proved suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessful.
