            <seg type="columnLine">reviewing fanzines. For various reasons, perhaps</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not all of them impersonal, I am not in favor of it.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I liked the old version better. I shall enumerate</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">some of these reasons. First of all, FAN-FARE</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">has been published eight times, now, and in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seven reviews that have appeared, FAN-FARE has</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been on the "B-list" or its new equivalent seven</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">times. 1 don't like to say this, because it sounds</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">conceited to me when I see others doing the same</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thing, but I firmly believe my fanzine is worthy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of more recognition than it is obtaining in STAR-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">TLING STORIES. Perhaps not so much the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">regular issues, although they are certoinly nothing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to apologize for. but definitely the anniversary</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">issue. Let me refresh your mind; and instead of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">being interviewed by fans for fanzines (as you</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">anecdote-d) for hours on end, spend some of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">time relooking at that issue. It was the January,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">1951, issue, and contained 46 pages (8x11) includ-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing two covers. There were five stories, one of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">them 10,000 words long. It was mimeographed at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">least as well as the last issue of the old DREAM</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">QUEST (Vol. 1, #6). and I think about as well</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as NEKROMANTIKON. Of course, I am unable</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to print or multigraph or offset or otherwise dupli-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cate it or parts of it, but my mimeoing is neater</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> If you remember (unless you've deposited in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Bank) the old system divided the fanzines into the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">good batch (the "A-list") and the not-so-good</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">batch (the "B-list''). At times the "A-list" was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">very short; at times it was very long. I THINK</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">"FAN-FARF." IS GOOD ENOUGH TO HAVE</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">GOT INTO THE A-LIST UNDER THE OLD</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">SYSTEM. So perhaps my "beef" is mainly selfish;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but that doesn't make it any less true. Under the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">old system, all the really good fanzines were given</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">due recognition; now only ten are afforded pub-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">licity. One month, there may be only five or six</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">really good fanzines, and you will have to pick</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">some not-so-hot jobs. Other times you'll have more</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">than ten magazines, all of which are outstanding,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">all of which are worthy of recognition. Thus, some</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which do not deserve recognition are getting it;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and some which deserve it are denied it. Is this</seg>
