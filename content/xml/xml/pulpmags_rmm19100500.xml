At that time freight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">billed only to the coast bank of the Missis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sippi River, was rebilled from East St. Louis</seg><seg type="columnLine">to St. Louis, and therefore lost its identity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Young Fort's work was to reestablish the</seg><seg type="columnLine">identity of this freight.

Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore returning to Chicago he was promoted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the chief clerkship, and remained with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Wabash until the receivership was closed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He then came to New York and entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">employ of the New York Central in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office of the late George H.

Many other</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms of signals were tried before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">semaphore was adopted as the standard</seg><seg type="columnLine">for railroading, the most common of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was a disk, half solid and half per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forated, giving it the appearance of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">waffle.

The practise was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show a danger-signal until a train had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the station five or ten minutes, ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cording to its speed, then indicating</seg><seg type="columnLine">" clear," trusting to luck that the train</seg><seg type="columnLine">had kept going.

The idea then, as now, was to di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vide the track into sections, or blocks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">never permitting more than one train on</seg><seg type="columnLine">any one block.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under permissive signaling, this rule</seg><seg type="columnLine">is regularly violated ; but the principle</seg><seg type="columnLine">involved remains intact, although its ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plication is not strict. Men stationed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">switches and irregular intervals were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">original dividing-points at which blocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended and began, but tUey soon gave way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to definite markings, the operator at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther end of the block telegraphing</seg><seg type="columnLine">back when the block was clear. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">trains waited at the entrance to each block</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the conductor or engineer had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived a written message giving him per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission to proceed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This system was well enough as long</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the traffic was not heavy, but it re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired too much track for each train to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be economical on a busy road. The first</seg><seg type="columnLine">development with the purpose of secur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing speed was the distant signal invent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed in the early fifties, and erected as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment at Meadowbrook, near Edin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burgh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">" Distant " Blade Arrives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This proved so successful that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon generally used. It was placed down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the track in advance of a station, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the engineer information whether it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was safe to enter the block in which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">station was located.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The distant signal was made almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the first with a " fishtail," or " swal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowtail," to distinguish it from the home</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal, which was square at the end.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like the home signal, it was operated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, a long wire extending down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">track to the semaphore pole, connecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a crank, which lifted the blade.

A current is generated</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the track at one end of the block</seg><seg type="columnLine">and communicated to one of the rails. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">passes from rail to rail through the fish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plates and special bonds placed there for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purpose until it reaches the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the block, where an insulator between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends of the rails prevents the current go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing farther.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A wire at that point connects it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a relay in the form of an electromagnet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">through which it conveys the current to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other rail of the track. The current</seg><seg type="columnLine">then passes back through the second rail</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the generator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When there is no train on the block,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the electromagnet in the relay is ener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gized by the passing current, and an ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mature, through which the current passes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is held tight to the magnet. The arma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture will remain where it is unless some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing short-circuits the current; and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">long as it remains, the home signal, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is operated by the current through an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other electromagnet in the signal - box,</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be at normal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">How It Works.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as a train strikes the rails, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels pick up the current of electricity</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the track and send it from rail to rail</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the axle, instead of by the longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">route through the relay-box. A portion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the current continues to pass through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the relay-box, however, but it is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong enough to hold up the armature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which drops.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When this happens, an armature in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal-box also drops, making another</seg><seg type="columnLine">connection and causing a different cur=</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent, which sets the machinery in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal-box in operation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All systems are not the same, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">principle of breaking the circuit does not</seg><seg type="columnLine">vary. In all, the dropping of the arma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture creates an opposing current which</seg><seg type="columnLine">actuates the machinery enclosed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal-box.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the case of the home signal which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is at clear, the dropping of the armature</seg><seg type="columnLine">sends a current into the signal-box which</seg><seg type="columnLine">energizes various cogs and cranks, mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the blade to danger. In some systems</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are two armatures in the signal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">box, one a clutch inagnet, which pulls up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the signal by the strength of its clutch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Cannot Go Wrong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the train passes off the rails and</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the block, the current through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">relay is restored, the armature is lifted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the current in the signal-box is cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">off. The whole mechanism is immediate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly deenergized, and the wheels in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal-box are revolved in the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction by the weight of the blade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">648</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which, having nothing to support it. falls</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to its original position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the normal danger system the blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">rises to vertical and falls to horizontal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a normal clear system it rises to hori-.</seg><seg type="columnLine">zontal and falls to vertical.

The train entering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the block with which the distant signal is</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected short-circuits the current and</seg><seg type="columnLine">causes the armature to drop simultaneous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly with the home signal at that point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The new current created by the drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping of the armature communicates the</seg><seg type="columnLine">train's approach to the distant signal sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral blocks ahead, and it flies to caution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As the train passes into the next block</seg><seg type="columnLine">it picks up the same current again, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although the train passes out of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">block, the current is maintained by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corresponding relay in the next block,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so on until the train reaches the block</seg><seg type="columnLine">at which the distant signal is situated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As each distant signal reaches back</seg><seg type="columnLine">through several blocks, a multiplication</seg><seg type="columnLine">of relays is needed.

Not know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing why, but instantly, she was in pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">session of the papers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " When he is better we will ask him</seg><seg type="columnLine">what to do," she said quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mexican went on dressing Sam's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound with such an air of complete ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorption in his task that Lily was half</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclined to discredit her intuition.

Sam had loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">her a long time. She knew this with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman's' inner vision. But it was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he had a definitely good prospect</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had told her. If he lost this re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, it would mean, at the best, a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">702</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wait. And young, loving, eager to be his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife, she contemplated the prospect with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked long and critically into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam's face. Deep lines of fatigue, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly pallor caused by the bleeding, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneven breathing, told her that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hope to get to the fort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was nine o'clock. The papers must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be there before three. She might call</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mexican. But, even without the sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picion that would persist in her mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she knew he stood little chance of arri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ving at the fort. He was too heavy for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her pony, the only horse on the ranch</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was so familiar with the route that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could keep his way in spite of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was just one way to get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers there in time.	-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She must go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But her mother? For weeks, she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be in a state bordering on</seg><seg type="columnLine">collapse. No word came to her from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy; and, with the natural instinct of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such natures, she had grown more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more dependent on her daughter. Lily</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered if she dared risk the ride on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her account.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked at the man she loved. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">great assurance came to her that .her</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort to serve him must meet with suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess. She kissed him softly and blushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if he were conscious of the caress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She saddled her pony and rode off in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the storm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At one o'clock she delivered the pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers to the sheriff at Fort Worth, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained Sam's condition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No urging would detain her.

His eyes rested on Lily. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">if she suggested it, he lifted his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">to feel for his papers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lily, have you my papers?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried, as he discovered their loss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Menden was just coming into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.

It is understood that</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Fred has completed his college and Altoona course, Warrington will place him.

Bonds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the value of half a million dollars have been stolen, and suspicion points toward War-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rington's son, though the matter is still kept quiet. Warrington, senior, is suspicious of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the motives of an Englishman named Montresor, who has gained the friendship of Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warrington, and apparently of Louise, Warrington's daughter. The old man gives the</seg><seg type="columnLine">task of solving the disappearance of the bonds, and of returning them secretly to the safe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Erskine. He is to work absolutely in the dark, receiving no recognition from Warring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, using any means he wishes. He is to take Louise to the opera that night; but Louise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspecting him, has the coachman drive to Lincoln Park, and there Fred is assaulted by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man whom he believes to be Montresor. Erskine is walking 011 the lake shore, thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the situation, when he meets a man who proves to be the discharged coachman of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Warringtons. He is very loyal to Miss Warrington, and this has resulted in his dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge.

Other men arrive, and Erskine gathers that it is their</seg><seg type="columnLine">intention to keep a rendezvous with young Warrington and then kill him.

Erskine smiled slightly, laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">his book, aside, /thrust his hands into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pockets, stretched himself, and looked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney McGrane never had deluded</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself with the idea that he was adept</seg><seg type="columnLine">at mind-reading, and if he had, his lack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of success in studying the features of Er-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skine, with whom he had been traveling</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the greater part of two days, might</seg><seg type="columnLine">well have discouraged him. The face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Altoona man had been like a mask;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in the eyes of this dogged enemy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montresor's there was a glint that never</seg><seg type="columnLine">died away, and it pleased the Irishman</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see it there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the greater part of this long</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey, Erskine had had little to say.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he did speak, however, his words</seg><seg type="columnLine">and manner were cheerful enough; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not once had he spoken of the quest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he was'engaged, or of the death of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joseph Warrington.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the speculative McGrane, only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was clear. The ticket he carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given him to understand that their</seg><seg type="columnLine">destination was Wapiti Falls, and he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered that while he and Erskine had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood together beside Lake Michigan, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">prior to the appearance of Joseph War-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rington, he had heard Montresor say to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man he called Slevin something of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this town which the train was now ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching. He had failed, however, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp the significance of the speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Erskine looked out of the window,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a feeling of apprehension suddenly began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to steal over him. Was it not possible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all, that he had been following a</seg><seg type="columnLine">false trail ? In the darkness, on the beach,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he had heard .Montresor say to Slevin that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Inter-State had " the paper," and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it transferred " to the Dale " at Wapiti</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falls. He knew that the Inter-State and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Dale were express companies. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">was " the paper " that had been mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">something else than the missing bonds?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This doubt was sufficiently disquieting</seg><seg type="columnLine">of itself, but there was another that har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">assed him. If "the paper" should con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sist of the bonds he sought, would it be</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible for him to obtain possession of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them by means of the desperate plan that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had formulated?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of the one thousand dollars which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had received from Andrew Warrington</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had spent less than one hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty, and the remainder was now in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wallet in an inside pocket of his vest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Large as this sum would have seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him only a few days before, he wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether it would suffice for the work that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been cut out for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Altoona man's thoughts were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether occupied with the task that</seg><seg type="columnLine">confronted him. however.

Despite Warrington's injunction</seg><seg type="columnLine">to refrain from offering any report on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress he was making in his quest, Er-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skine felt that he had taken the general</seg><seg type="columnLine">manager a little too literally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was plain that 'Warrington was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced that his son was indeed guilty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the act with which he had been charged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that, though harboring this suspicion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was determined that no evidence of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's complicity in the affair should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">submitted to him by the man to whom he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had assigned the task of recovering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonds. It was also clear that the elder</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warrington suspected that his son had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in some sort of a conspiracy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montresor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But did he know enough of the nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this conspiracy to lead him to suspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Montresor had designs on Joseph's</seg><seg type="columnLine">life? By this time the general manager</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that his son had been slain, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only natural that he should do all in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his power to aid the police in their search</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his murderer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oftentimes, as Erskine asked himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">these questions, he would become con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">WITHOUT LIGHTS.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">715</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">scious of a sudden sinking feeling that</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought with it some of the sensations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nightmare, and at these times his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts were of Louise Warrington.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was Andrew Warrington's daughter also</seg><seg type="columnLine">in league with Montresor?

The very thought was mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strous!

Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he entered the door of this McGrane</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched him on the arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " They're sittin' over yonder, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner," lie explained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Have you seen Montresor?"

" You--you don't think, sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Miss Warrington has come all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">y&gt;'ay out here to meet that murderin' Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lishman?" he faltered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " It looks like it, Barney."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " After what he's done to her brother?

This, as you will remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber, left Chicago shortly after daylight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McGrane nodded gloomily. Then, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pause, he said: " That looks likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, sir. But if we was to tell them</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Mr. Joseph is dead, and how it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened, don't you suppose that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be enough to make Miss Warrington</seg><seg type="columnLine">break away from Montresor? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " They would insist on some corrobora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of our story, and an hour or more</seg><seg type="columnLine">might elapse before they would succeed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtaining this.

That way is ours, and it is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">improbable that we shall have the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladies as fellow passengers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Erskine finished speaking the West</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coast express slowed down at the station</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform. With his ticket and berth</seg><seg type="columnLine">checks in one hand, and his suit-case in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other, Erskine hurried toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">train, with McGrane at his heels. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">porter conducted them to the section which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Erskine had engaged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they seated themselves both men</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced out of a window that commanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">a view of the station platform. A mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment later they saw Miss Warrington and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mother leave the waiting-room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">move quickly toward the train. Miss War-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rington, who still wore her veil, glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">from right to left, but whether she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for Erskine and his companion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or for Montresor, was a matter of conjec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture so far as the Altoona man was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In less than half a minute the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman had again disappeared from Er-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skine's view, and he doubted not that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ascending the steps to the platform</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the car. Rising abruptly, he made his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the rear of the car in which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been seated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had taken only a few paces, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, when he saw her just before she dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared in the stateroom at the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car. Satisfied that she was indeed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the train, Erskine returned to his seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he sat down the Irishman looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him interrogatively. Erskine nodded, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not speak. McGrane compressed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips and looked out of the window. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exceptions of Erskine, McGrane, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two women who had entered the state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, all the other occupants of the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been on the train at the time it arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Wapiti Falls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Five minutes after Erskine returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his seat the train drew out of the station.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As it did so McGrane, who occupied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front seat, leaned forward and addressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Erskine, who sat facing him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "*Ain't seen him yet-?"1' the Irishman</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, in a hoarse whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Erskine shook his head. McGrane sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">back dejectedly. The younger man then</seg><seg type="columnLine">took from his pocket a time-table which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been studying at various times</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he was riding between Chicago and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wapiti Falls. After looking this over for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several minutes, he glanced out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window, then rose abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I'll be back in a few minutes, Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney," he said shortly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later he was standing before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the closed door of the stateroom which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen Miss Warrington enter.

This was so long in coming that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was about to knock again when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door opened and Louise Warrington, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her veil thrown back, stood before him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The young woman's face was very pale,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes were red, and there were dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">circles under her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Erskine had expected that the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman would receive him with some mani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">festation of surprise. On the contrary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, he found her singularly self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed. For several seconds she re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garded him gravely, then, in a low, quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, she said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Come in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Erskine bowed, entered, and closed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">WITHOUT LIGHTS.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">719</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">door behind him. Louise seated herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside her mother, who surveyed Erskine</seg><seg type="columnLine">coldly. The young woman looked out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Erskine stood awkwardly just inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the closed door, the train rounded a curve</seg><seg type="columnLine">so quickly that the young man almost lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">his footing. He quickly recovered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">equilibrium and, addressing Mrs. War-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rington, he asked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " May I sit down? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ignoring the question, Mrs. Warring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton turned toward the window, as her</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter had done. Erskine flushed pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. It was plain that both ladies re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented his intrusion, and were not disposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to converse with him. Doubtless, Louise</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed him to be nothing more than an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary detective, who had been assigned</seg><seg type="columnLine">by her father to watch her movements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  If this were so he scarcely could charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">her with lack of courtesy.

As a result, we've been called</seg><seg type="columnLine">down several times by the freight traffic</seg><seg type="columnLine">department. It made T.

Britt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> THE OLD MAN TO JIM.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dear. Jim : Some time before you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">born there were two men working for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">B.	and D. One was named Lynes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one Connolly. Both worked as clerks in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the superintendent's office. Both were</seg><seg type="columnLine">good men, knew their business, and stuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">One day a fellow was brought in from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outside and put over their heads at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">salary twenty-five dollars more than they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were getting. Lynes went right up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air about it. He kicked and stormed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked the road. Connolly took it quiet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, obeyed orders, and when the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow told him to do anything he did it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In about a month's time Lynes was</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely changed. From being a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady worker, he grumbled continually,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disobeyed the new man and knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to every one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">At first people agreed with him. Tt</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked tough to have a job like that put</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on him, and they told him so. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him worse .than ever. But after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a while people got tired of listening to</seg><seg type="columnLine">LETTERS OF AN OLD RAILROAD MAN AND HIS SON. 731</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Lynes. They had their own affairs to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attend to. They set Lynes down as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chronic kicker, and began to knock him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually he dropped out of things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took to criticizing the road and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office in public.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime, Connolly had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">on sticking steadily to business and obey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing orders when they were given, regard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less of who gave them. The new man</seg><seg type="columnLine">made bad breaks, but Connolly always</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on hand to help him out, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two got along pretty smoothly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day a better position fell vacant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the chief clerk, looking around for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">competent man, thought of Connolly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was loyal to his employers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lynes went up in the air. He had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grievance before, but it was an insult</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. He was as well able to take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">job as Connolly. Indeed, he thought he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hold it down better. In addition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new man had got settled and was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning to be sharp with Lynes. Lynes</seg><seg type="columnLine">refused to do what the new man told him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was reported to the C. C., and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">C.	C. got him up 011 the carpet. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that, Lynes didn't have any use</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the road. He drew his salary, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">only did what he absolutely had to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One night he had gone off a little be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore closing time, and was standing 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner waiting for a car, when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger asked him the way to' the B. and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">D.	Building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lynes told him how to get there, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">added that it was the worst road in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. The stranger naturally wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know why, and Lynes began to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">him about the awful delays on the line,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wrecks, and the rotten service.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He painted such an awful picture that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he got the stranger interested. Inci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dentally, he let drop the fact, to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he knew what he was talking about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was in the superintendent's office.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That settled the stranger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An employee of the road certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to know if it was dangerous to</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel on. He thanked Lynes and struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">out for another route.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About a week after that a letter came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from the general manager's office</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the general superintendent to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">superintendent. It created a good deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of excitement around Connolly's desk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">About quitting time, Connolly called</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Lynes over and handed him the letter. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">read :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About four days ago I met a Mr. Frisbie</seg><seg type="columnLine">in New York, a member of Frisbie &amp; Co.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">big cotton exporters. Mr. Frisbie had sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very large shipment of cotton over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">P. F. R. R.. and I asked him if he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">give us a share of this business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He told me that he had considered doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">so on this shipment, but that he had learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">from an authoritative source that the delays</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so many 011 the B. and D. that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not afford to risk it on his shipments, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">invariably called for connection with steam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers sailing on set days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I asked him what this source was. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reluctant about answering, but I finally got</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to state that seven days ago he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Baltimore on business, and accidentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">met a man in the superintendent's office who</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him this information.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I challenged his statement, and he said it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be readily confirmed, as the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had told him this was on the train reports,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thoroughly familiar with our traffic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I suggest that action be taken to remove</seg><seg type="columnLine">so disloyal an employee. In this instance his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying statements, if Mr. Frisbie was truthful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have lost us thousands of dollars in business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The letter was signed by the freight</seg><seg type="columnLine">traffic manager.

D., General Manager.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an instant everything swam before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lynes's eyes. He had to grip hold of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk to remain standing. The chief clerk</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up at him. He gulped once or</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice, and tried to speak, but his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lost. It was only too evident that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was guilty, and the chief clerk knew it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lynes got his discharge 011 the spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There wasn't a railroad man in town</seg><seg type="columnLine">who didn't hear of his disloyalty, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he applied for work he was prompt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly turned down. He had a wife and child</seg><seg type="columnLine">to support, and things must have gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard with him, for the year after that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was one of depression, and work</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as hard to get as green corn in winter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was just about ten years ago that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back to the B. and D. His hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gray, and he was dressed like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramp. The chief clerk had been pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moted right along, and at the same time</seg><seg type="columnLine">Connolly had gone along with him, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">one was general superintendent and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other his chief clerk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lynes put up such a hard-luck story</seg><seg type="columnLine">732</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to his old friend Connolly, now C.

TAFT is a Canadian immigration-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•	agent, and if he doesn't get all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">belongs to it for any party of immigrants</seg><seg type="columnLine">he happens to be conducting he wants to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know why. Recently he was convoying a</seg><seg type="columnLine">party from Wheeling, West Virginia, to Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">berta, Canada. He bought through tickets</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Detroit--twenty-two of them--via the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baltimore and Ohio to Columbus, thence</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Hocking Valley to Detroit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Baltimore and Ohio train arrived at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Columbus at 3.45 a.m., and, according to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite understanding Mr. Taft had with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the company, its car, with the immigration</seg><seg type="columnLine">party, was to be attached to the regular 4.45</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hocking Valley train out of Columbus. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">even immigration-agents have their troubles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this nice little program was not to be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Hocking Valley officials were very</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry, but there was a trilling consideration</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shape of the Interstate Commerce</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commission between their insistent patron</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their really obliging selves. Mr. Taft</seg><seg type="columnLine">had twenty-two through tickets, but to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">a through car he must have twenty-five.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Otherwise, both he and the Hocking Valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be in trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That sounded formidable, but it didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeze Mr. Taft. He said his verbal contract</seg><seg type="columnLine">called for a through car. He had in his care</seg><seg type="columnLine">several babies, whose innocent young lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">should not be endangered by changing cars</seg><seg type="columnLine">at such an unearthly hour, as well as an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, whose gray hair he would not bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in sorrow to another car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He would either have his car taken out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the 5-4S. or he would rouse from their beds</seg><seg type="columnLine">the railway commissioners of the State of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ohio to give him his rights; better that four</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere-'railway commissioners should lose</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep, catch cold, and die, than that one im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">migrant, a prospective citizen of Canada and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the British Empire, should change cars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this the Hocking Valley officials bright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened perceptibly.

On the morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the third day, while Leigh was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">court, Ahearne quietly slipped a note in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand. It was to the effect that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be at the office over the drug-store</seg><seg type="columnLine">at about seven o'clock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big Irishman was on time, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is what he told the reporter:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That before court had opened three</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the parishioners of Father Podinski</seg><seg type="columnLine">had called in order to obtain a warrant</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the latter's arrest on charges of fe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonjous assault. Scott, the warrant-clerk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a protege of Burke, had taken them</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a corner, and, as Ahearne had over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard, told them to come back at four</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock, when he would see that the war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rants were ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He also warned them not to talk to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'newspaper men. Ahearne, smelling a rat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had subsequently watched Scott, and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him despatch a note to the Municipal aft-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er the court had adjourned at one o'clock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From this he inferred that another at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt was being made to freeze Leigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " But when did the judge sign the war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rants?
