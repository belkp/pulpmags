                    <ab>COMING NEXT MONTH</ab>
                    <ab>IN THE sun the shadow tracery of the grille's symbolic pattern lay vividly out- lined on the ground. The girl gave a little
                        gasp of delight. She dropped Smith's hand and ran forward three short steps, and plunged into the very center of that shadowy
                        pattern on the ground. And what happened then was too incredible to believe.</ab>
                    <ab>The pattern ran over her like a garment, curving to the curve of her body in the way all shadows do. But as she stood there
                        striped and laced with the darkness of it, there came a queer shifting in the lines of black tracery, a subtle, inexplicable
                        movement to one side. And with that motion she vanished. It was exactly as if that shifting had moved her out of one world
                        into another. Smith stared stupidly at the spot from which she had disappeared.</ab>
                    <ab>Then several things happened almost simultaneously. The zoom of an airplane broke suddenly into the quiet, a black shadow
                        dipped low over the rooftops, and Smith, too late, realized that he stood defenseless in full view of the searching ships.
                        There was only one way out, and that was too fantastic to put faith in, but he had no time to hesitate. With one leap he
                        plunged full into the midst of the shadow of the tree of life.</ab>
                    <ab>Its tracery flowed round him, molding its pattern to his body. And outside the boundaries everything executed a queer little
                        sidewise dip and slipped in the most extraordinary manner, like an optical illusion, into quite another scene. There was no
                        intervention of blankness. It was as if he looked through the bars of a grille upon a picture which without warning slipped
                        sidewise, while between the bars ap- peared another scene, a curious, dim landscape, gray as if with the twilight of early
                        evening. The air had an oddly thickened look, through which he saw the quiet trees and the flower-spangled grass of the place
                        with a queer, unreal blending, like the landscape in a tapestry, all its outlines blurred.</ab>
                    <ab>In the midst of this tapestried twilight the burning whiteness of the girl he had followed blazed like a flame. She had paused
                        a few steps away and stood waiting, apparently quite sure that he would come after. . . .</ab>

                    <ab>By Lloyd Arthur Eshbach</ab>
                    <ab>Many readers like to read shud- dery stories that send icy thrills of horripilation up their spines and tickle the roots of
                        their hair. This powerful tale is just what they want, for it is a goose-flesh tale of stark horror.</ab>
                    <ab>The guests at Clifford Darrell's yachting party were enjoying themselves with dancing and love- making, when suddenly a grisly
                        horror from out of the past swept in from the sea in an ancient galley, and claimed them for its own. The frightful fate that
                        seized them on the dreadful island of living dead men and women makes a story that will hold your fascinated attention to the
                        last word. This gripping novelette will be published complete</ab>

                <ab>In Magazine Form A MIDSUMMER NIGHTS DREAM</ab>
                <ab>By William Shakespeare. Edited by Farnsworth Wright, Chicago: Wright's Shakespeare Library, 35 cents. HERE is a brand-new idea in
                    pub-lishing the Shakespeare plays, this being the first of the series. In this magazine-like publication, the complete authentic
                    text is printed in large and beautiful type on good paper with ample margin, with 25 drawings by Virgil Fin-lay. The purpose is to
                    make Shakespeare as attractive to everybody as he should be. Both the editor and the illustrator are Shakespeare enthusiasts, and
                    they are realizing a life-long dream in thus pre-senting the plays in the most readable form at a popular price. Only the
                    spell-ing and the punctuation have been mod-ernized, and at the end there is a glos-sary and a series of comments. --The Columbia
