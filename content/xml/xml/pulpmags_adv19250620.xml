            <seg type="columnLine">why a full-length spine puts one in an entirely new</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">class physically. The spinal column is a series of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tiny bones, between which are pads or cushions of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cartilage. Nothing in the ordinary activities of us</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">humans stretches the spine. So it "settles" day by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">day, until those once soft and resilient pads become</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thin as a safety-razor blade--and just about as hard.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">One's spine (the most wonderfully designed shock-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">absorber known) is then an unyielding column that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">transmits every shock straight to the base of the brain.</seg>
        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Do you wonder folks have backaches and head-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">aches? That one's nerves pound toward the end of a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hard day? Or that a nervous system may periodically</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">go to pieces? For every nerve in one's body connects</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with the spine, which is a sort of central switchboard.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">When the "insulation," or cartilage, wears down and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">flattens out, the nerves are exposed, or even impinged</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">--and there is trouble on the line.</seg>
        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Now, for proof that subiaxation of the spine causes</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">most of the ills and ailments which spell "age" in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">complete spinal laxation as Bradstreet does it. But</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">like everything else, one must know how. No amount</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of violent exercise will do it; not even chopping wood.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> At intervals the gun scolded. Nell finally</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It was off to the right, about opposite the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Nell felt a thrill such as he remembered</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> So the squad went forward and Nell with</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">round ball-like thing that he knew very</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">well was a grenade. On the other side of</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> The gun was huge and round, a large cyl-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Beside the gun a man knelt, looking into</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">like a dog's, smelling the wind. The gun-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">from and why he went there, I don't know</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and, anyway, it doesn't much matter. But</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he started right away to annex that island</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and he did it. Nobody interfered with him,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for nobody knew whether the island be-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">longed to the French, the British or the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Germans and, what's more, nobody cared.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">So McClure, he built himself a store and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">imported a lot of trade-goods which he bar-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tered with the natives for copra. And a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Well, McClure changed all that and before</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was the beginning of the end. Not much</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">longer could the aged mule maintain the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was amazed to find that it was two o'clock</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the afternoon. At any rate Lisbeth had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">given the bandits a race that they would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">long remember, and she had justified his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">gave him an inspiration. To his right</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">loomed a short, steep canon leading to a</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> The particular thing that influenced him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to make the attempt was the seeming in-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">glance Alex estimated Lisbeth's chance to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">climb, and gave her about one in three.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">One thing he did know was that if they could</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">range was as good as a bullet. When the</seg>
