As</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Union Pacific thrust its steel ribbons</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther and farther into the West, the dead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly feud between Mink and Welch was fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching a definite breaking point. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the payoff would be, and who would</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill whom, were moot questions. You could</seg><seg type="columnLine">get an even bet any way you wanted it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bad feeling between Jed Mink and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pike Welch started in a friendly poker</seg><seg type="columnLine">game. At that time, the terminal point was</seg><seg type="columnLine">North Platte, Nebraska. Mink happened to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce an extra and convenient ace at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong time and Welch took exception to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the play and cracked him over the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a broken beer bottle. Mink retaliated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a quick knife thrust that grazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Welch's cheek. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two adversaries were quickly called</seg><seg type="columnLine">to account for their seemingly rowdy con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duct by the section superintendent in North</seg><seg type="columnLine">Platte. "We've got enough trouble as it is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with this floatin' population," the superin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendent pointed out, "without you two sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion hand foremen settin' a bad example to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men. It's up to you to stop fights and</seg><seg type="columnLine">such--not to start 'em.

Behave yourselves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pair of chastened foremen saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, but only for a short time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In Julesburg, Colorado, Mink, once again,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">came up with an unaccounted for ace in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicate game. Then, with fists and knives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two men had a set-to that lasted for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour. Spectators called it a draw, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheered wildly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was in Cheyenne that the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">"leaders of men" had a gunfight on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main street. It was bloody, but far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatal for either Mink or Welch. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it now became apparent to all that one man</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the other did not have much longer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live. They had already indulged in three</seg><seg type="columnLine">battles, each worse than the previous one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but all had ended on an even score. Fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being tempted too far.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly,, the betting started. Big Tim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Malloy, proprietor of a highly portable sa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loon, became stake holder for hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bets. At even money, supporters of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opponents were laying heavy wagers on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their favorite. It was a case of betting on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which of the two quarrelsome foremen got</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried in the "boneyard"--as end-of-track</seg><seg type="columnLine">cemeteries were called--first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On placing a bet with stakeholder Malloy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the regular procedure was to lay your</seg><seg type="columnLine">money on the line and say, "Fifty dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Mink gets in the boneyard first." Or,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ten clams that Welch makes the boneyard</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Mink does."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Malloy, a happy and prosperous business</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, merely deducted five percent of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">monies, as his fee. Personally, he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">care which killed which, or who made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boneyard first. The feud was making him</seg><seg type="columnLine">an'especially rich man. Soon, he figured,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could retire from this hectic railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">building riot of a life, take his profits from</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon and stakeholding,.and retire to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet of the East. Malloy, although avid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take their money for the rankest of whiskey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">always felt himself far above the railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers, their foremen, and other denizens</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the floating town, "End-of-the-Track,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">(Continued on page 10)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         3 \uu.y</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     SEND FOR JOAN THE WAD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        Thousands say:--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">SHE HAS THE SECRET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In several million booklets you may have read extracts from testimonials</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">received from as* far back as 1930.

He. was a long, thin man with an angu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar jaw, the knots of his knuckles the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">12</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">remaining sign of the years he had spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">grubbing in worthless soil that had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised a crop. His wife had left him for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with money; there was a hideous scar</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his neck where a cattleman had burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with a rope. "That's it, Chet," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly, looking out across the valley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Here's revenge, finally, and along with it</seg><seg type="columnLine">a home for a lot of good people--and we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ones that will get it for 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man called Chet was young. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others he was bearded and dirty and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the furtive look of a hunted man about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but there was also rebellion in his pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIFTEEN WESTERN TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">blue eyes. He laughed shortly. "You're be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning to believe it, aren't you Les?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anger was like a drawn curtain across</seg><seg type="columnLine">Les Gunther's eyes. "You forgetting?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not likely," Chet Wainsworth said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't ever," Gunther said. "It's Pete</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bryan that claims that valley. Does that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean anything to you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chet Wainworth stood up. He was tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and well built and the grace of his move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments betrayed his youth. "I said I remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered, didn't I?" he said. He walked off into</seg><seg type="columnLine">an oak thicket, passing the four men</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched out in the new grass, coming at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last to the lookout stationed in a nest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks at the crest of the knoll. "Well?" Chet</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tonight," the lookout said. His voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the voice of an old man and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sprinkle of gray in his whiskers. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowboys will be out at the ranch. We can</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride in and take over the town and come</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning the wagons will be in the valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the claims will be staked out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then comes the slaughter," Chet said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But we won't be there to see it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter, boy?" the old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">said quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe I'm tired," Chet Wainsworth</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Or maybe I'm sick of lying to my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're giving, the folks in that wagon</seg><seg type="columnLine">train a chance," the old man said.

"Maybe I bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter get -some sense," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE HADN'T heard Les Gunther come</seg><seg type="columnLine">up behind him. He turned and Les</seg><seg type="columnLine">was standing there, that lazy, loose jointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">slouch making him look half asleep. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was grinning. "That's a good thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chet," Les Gunther said. "A little sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't fiurt you." Gunther straightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly. "General meeting, all hands," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. He snapped the order like an army</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another month of this, and you'll expect</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to call you Sir, Chet thought disgusted-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. He followed along with Nate Williams,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lookout, and presently, the other four</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of the gang joined them under an</seg><seg type="columnLine">oak tree. Les Gunther took his j)lace in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of them, ramrod straight now, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands laced behind his back. He paced back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forth, his eyes on the ground, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men waited, tolerant half-grins on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearded faces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Men," Gunther said finally, "down there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the free land we promised these settlers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They paid us to bring them here and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't failed 'em. There's a cowman by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the name of Pete Bryan claims that valley."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He paused dramatically. "I know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">name means something different to every</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of you, but to all of us, it means land</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbing. Pete Bryan won't like us moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his valley." Gunther's voice took on a-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper tone. "There's women and kids de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pending on us, men. The law will call us</seg><seg type="columnLine">raiders and even killers, but God is on our</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. Don't ever forget that even when things</seg><seg type="columnLine">go against us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chet Wainsworth felt disgusted. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from a deeply religious family, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was this sacrilege that had first driven him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to examine Les Gunther's real motives. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew now what Les Gunther was after, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was nothing noble about it. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">would ride down into that valley to plunder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and steal anything they could get their hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. Beyond the hill a dozen wagons waited;</seg><seg type="columnLine">farm people who had been driven from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">land and who now followed the shadowy fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure of Les Gunther and his raiders in blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">faith. By morning, those wagons would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the valley; men and women would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">kneeling in prayer, blessing the name of Les</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunther. And by nightfall, those farmers</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be lucky if they were alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chet didn't listen to the rest of Gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther's speech. He had heard it a dozen times.-</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the only salve Gunther ever used on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his conscience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Les Gunther had been a self-styled preach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er in the Kansas cooperative' community</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had once been home to the men in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">band. He had a persuasive way of talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after that bloody night when every</seg><seg type="columnLine">building and nearly half the members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">community had been wiped out, revenge had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been an easy commodity to sell. Chet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wainworth, only nineteen, had buried' his</seg><seg type="columnLine">RIDE WITH THE GUNSMOKE JUDAS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">parents and joined up with Gunther's raid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first there were more than fifty men in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the band, an outfit pledged to land reforms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and justice for the nesters, who were spill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing west in ever increasing numbers, lured</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Homestead Act and the cheap rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road land. The National Grange was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting to form. Les Gunther called himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">its enforcement arm. One -by one though,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the members of the band dropped out as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw Gunther bloat with his own im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portance, but they still supported him in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">reign of blood and violence. In a few, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seed of hatred and revenge was too strong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so they remained with the band, and with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, the chance for plunder was the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">motive for remaining. Chet looked at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, knowing them well. Old Nate Williams.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Metzger, there by the tree. Cluny, Breck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inridge, Kraft. And himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the end of the trail, and Chet knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Of the remaining band, Chet was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one not wanted for crimes that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing whatsoever to do with land reforms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was an outlaw band now, different</seg><seg type="columnLine">from others only in that it could find sanc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuary in the homes of farmers. For, Les</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunther knew a good thing when he saw it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had never let the farmers forget that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a martyr to a cause, hunted because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fought for farmers' rights. Chet looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Les Gunther now, seeing the hypocrisy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man and hating him for it. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunther turn' his head and open his shirt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposing the scar of the rope burn. Once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sight of that lynch noose had fired Chet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wainworth to the point of blindness. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">it disgusted him, for he knew that like ev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erything else Les Gunther did, this too was i</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pose. ,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This land is open to homestead," Les</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunther said. "You've seen the maps and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know it's so. Once we get our claims</seg><seg type="columnLine">staked there ain't no law can put us off ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept the kind of law you carry in a holster</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Pete Bryan himself taught us how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle that kind of law."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're finally going to fight, then, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">we?" Chet said. He saw Nate Williams</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance at him nervously; he saw the quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger in Les Gunther's eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're claiming homes for them that</seg><seg type="columnLine">need homes," Les Gunther said. "We're al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways ready -to fight for the rights of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own folks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've said it so damn often you believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">it yourself," Chet said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gunther's anger came to full flame. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other men avoided Chet's eyes. "There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">something on your mind, Chet," Gunther</seg><seg type="columnLine">said quietly. "You better get it off your</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," Chet said, "I will. I'm sick of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your speeches, that's all. I joined up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you because a cowman killed my mother and</seg><seg type="columnLine">because I figured folks like my folks wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting a square deal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The rest of us are here for the same rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons, Chet," Gunther said convincinly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chet laughed harshly. "Look, Gunther,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "If we're gonna rob the bank in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that town and loot the stores, let's do it. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">let's don't make out like we got guts enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight Pete Bryan, because we haven't, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">let's don't drag a bunch of farmers down</seg><seg type="columnLine">there with us and then leave 'em there to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight it out alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL the slackness was back in Les Gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther's frame. Those lizard eyes of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">came veiled and smoky. His voice was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lazy drawl. "I've never stopped a man from</seg><seg type="columnLine">quitting if he was of a mind to quit," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I reckon you can find your horse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damned easy," Chet said. "And I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">protect my back, too." He turned, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked rapidly away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was tenseness in his muscles, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had trouble with ljis hands when he sad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dled his horse. He saw Nate Williams com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward him and he busied himself with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cinch, trying to avoid Nate's eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't do it, boy," Nate said quietly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've got to, Nate," Ch§t said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even if you get out of this camp alive,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nate said, "you'll be dead inside a week.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the law don't get you right off, some cat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tleman will.

The old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man laid his hand on the boy's arm. "We've</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone too far, son," he said- kindly. "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't no turning back once you've gone as</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as we've gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then go ahead," Chet said savagely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But don't pull a bunch of dirt farmers into</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with you.

"Or tell 'em Les Gunther ain't got</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guts to face Pete Bryan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Nate's old eyes softened and it was as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he were seeing things a long time gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Would it be because of Lorraine Petti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Chet's blustering denial betrayed him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She's a pretty little thing,'' Nate said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I jioticed you talking to her a lot the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">week or so when we was bringing the folks</seg><seg type="columnLine">out here." His eyes clouded. "Maybe I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't blame you," he said, "but I've come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of my own skin first. Gunther's crazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a lot of things, I know, but he's right</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he says we can't afford to have a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">quit the band."

"I agree with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him there, Chet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Not you, Nate," Chet said softly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached down and took old Nate's hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">briefly and for a moment he felt a strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">companionship, remembering the days when</seg><seg type="columnLine">this band had started out with such high</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideals and purposes. "Let one of the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Nate Williams clung to the boy's hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'd watch myself there at the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyon if I was you," he whispered.

He touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">his spurs and rode across the grassy ridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and into the canyon that led to the tiny val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley where a dozen wagorts were drawn up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tight camp, awaiting the signal to pull</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the ridge and claim land they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">call their own. They waited there, know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing there was trouble ahead, willing to face</seg><seg type="columnLine">it because they were following Les Gunther</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his raiders, secure in the knowledge that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Les Gunther and his men would help them</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight for their rights. -</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Les Gunther wasn't going to fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would use the invasion of the nesters as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cover-up for his own operations and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shooting started, Les Gunther and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">raiders would be long gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Chet thought of the nesters, people who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were like his owri people. "You fools," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">^aid softly. "Damn blind fools, all of you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but my kind of fools."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rode into the canyon, and now, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a rifle in his hand. He had seen men try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to quit Les Gunther's band before. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped bury three of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOREWARNED by old Nate, Chet rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously, alert to every movement in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocky canyon ahead of him. He started</seg><seg type="columnLine">once when a ground squirrel skittered across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trail, straining his ears intently to hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the sound of his horse's hooves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somewhere there ahead of him, a man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a saddle mate was waiting now to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill him. It would be Breckinridge, Chet fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ured. He had always liked Breckinridge; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt no real malice toward him now. Breck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inridge was a tool, just as a rifle was a tool.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crime of murder, if murder was a crime,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested on the shoulders of Les Gunther, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who had started with a shining dream</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then twisted that dream to fit his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposes. And the betrayal of that dream</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the real crime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ears of Chet's horse pricked forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly and Chet tightened his grip on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reins. The sun beat down in the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyon, its heat intensified by the reflection</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the rocks. Chet felt the burning of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin and knew it was partly from tension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't want to kill Breckinridge; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't want to kill anyone. But there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no choice. It was kill or die, and again it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Les Gunther who had brought that con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition into being.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment, Chet considered sinking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurs and trying to make a run for it through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canyon. A man on a running horse made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mighty poor target. He might be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away with it. But before he could com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely decide, he saw the movement in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks above the trail and-knew that Breckin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge had already drawn a bead on him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chet's shout echoed back and forth across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the narrow canyon. "Don't do it, Breck."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And immediately, shattering the echo, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the-blast of the rifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lead tore savagely through Chet's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, nearly knocking him out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle. He fought to regain his balance'</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he jerked his own rifle waist high and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired. .He heard his lead screaming off a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock and then, an answering blast from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Breckinridge. Chet kicked his right foot free</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stirrup and dropped to the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">using his horse for a shield.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fired twice across the saddle before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse dropped without a sound, shot directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the head. Chet stood there, blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaming down his left arm. He heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Breckinridge say, "I'm sorry, Kid. I'm sor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ry as hell."</seg><seg type="columnLine">RIDE WITH THE GUNSMOKE JUDAS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">17</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a smash of sound that exploded</seg><seg type="columnLine">into darkness. Chet felt himself falling into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bottomless pit and a dark, dizzying cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept rolling down and piling up on him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smothering him in the moist blackness. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered the night the cattlemen had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to the Kansas community. -He remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered burying his mother and his father and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he remembered folowing the loose-jointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenger, Les Gunther, a man of God who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would lead grasshopper and drought starved</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, a man who would grintl his heel on</seg><seg type="columnLine">land grabbing, murdering cattlemen. An eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an eye, he remembered, and he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see his father reading from the huge, illus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated Bible. But even now, he couldn't for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">get that same Bible taught a man to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything seemed terribly real. The dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit into which he was falling had slimy stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls. He gripped at the walls until his fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gernails were torn and the pain was alive in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms. He lost his grasp and fell into total</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And there, in the rocks above the trail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Breckinridge looked at his still smoking</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle. He knew lhat he should pump one or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two more shots into the body that lay there</seg><seg type="columnLine">below him. That was the way Les Gunther</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have done it. But Breckinridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't bring himself to do it. "Damn it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kid," he said softly. "You shouldn't never</seg><seg type="columnLine">have tried it." Shaking his head, he mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his horse and turned back toward camp. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was deep night when Chet Wainsworth</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened his eVes. The velvet dome of heaven</seg><seg type="columnLine">was spangled with brilliant stars and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were silver shafts of light reaching down to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the black outline of the rolling hills.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It made him remember the pictures he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen in his father's Bible. He lay there quiet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, feeling a strange contentment as the soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze funneled down the rocky canyon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathed his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For those seconds, it seemed to him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he should expect the fiery angels to be stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing above him, the ones with blazing eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flaming swords; the avenging angels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thought- remained but a second and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, with a great physical shock, he realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was alive. Immediately, he tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move and a searing, wracking pain tore at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, pinning him to the ground. A voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "He's coming around. Do you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more of that whiskey, Sam?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A huge, dark shape hovered over him. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a bottle pressed against his teeth. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought against it momentarily, then swal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed, and the hot, stinging liquid trickled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down his throat and built a fire in his empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach. The dark shape spoke with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep, rumbling voice. "I don't like ghosts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Jane. I never did like ghosts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The man's alive," the soft voice said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Maybe he is," the man said, "but he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">close enough to being dead that he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">still be a ghost. And, if he ain't a ghost, he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them Gunther raiders that shot up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the town. I tell you, Miss Jane--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHET'S eyes focused momentarily and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the girl. She was like an angel bend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over him. He saw the dim outline of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face, the soft contour of her hair under</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flat brim hat. "He couldn't be one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raiders, Sam," the girl called Jane said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's five miles from town, isn't he? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been one of the settlers and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shot by the raiders for some reason."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What you aim to do with him, Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jane?" the man asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take him up to the line shack with us,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl said. "Can you lift him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Jane," the man said with convic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, "there ain't nothing Sam can't lift."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The darkness came again and now there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a soft swaying movement and Chet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wainworth gave in to it. He was not sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he had dreamed these things or if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so. He only knew that at the moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he didn't care. It didn't make that much</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference. Death, he decided, was sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">easier than living. A long time later, voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakened him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stared up at rough, hand-hewn rafters</seg><seg type="columnLine">and light trickling through the cracks be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween shakes. He was in a bunk of sorts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His clothes had been removed and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearing a man's shirt that was big enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to serve as a nightgown. He stirred uneasily</seg><seg type="columnLine">and realized that his torso and left shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">were bound tightly with bandages. He let</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right hand stray to his face and found a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick, matted growth of-beard, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he touched his lips, they were dry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracked. His cheeks felt sunken and hol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently a door opened, the light momen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarily blinding him, and then the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the door was filled with the tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulk of a man, with a body like the trunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a tree, and huge arms and shoulders that</seg><seg type="columnLine">18</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIFTEEN WESTERN TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sloped up into u bull neck. Chet's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved up and the man grinned, exposing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthful of solid gold teeth. "You a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">late for breakfast, Mister," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're Sam, aren't you?" Chet said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big man threw back his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed and the sound rumbled all through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room of the cabin. "Doggone I guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">you ain't a ghost after all," Sam said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Leastwise I ain't never had a ghost call me</seg><seg type="columnLine">by name before. Miss Jane! Doc!" he bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two more people came into the cabin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One was a tall, sparse man and Chet thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him immediately as a preacher. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the girl, and now Chet started searching</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind, wondering if there had been dreams</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered through the blackness, or if this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an actual person and she had really</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathed his face and brushed the hair off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead. The girl came to the bed smiling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's been a long time," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long?" Chet asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "^week," the girl said. "I'm Jane Bryan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And this is Doctor Acton. It's lucky for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and the rest of your people that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">around."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's more than luck," the doctor said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had a deep, resonant voice. "This boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the Man upstairs on his side. You go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on out, Jane. I want to have a look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thoughts started building in Chet's mind;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were almost tangible, as if he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">them; they were like an inverted pyramid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The small thought at the apeex was the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Bryan, focused and sharp, and then, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was another row of thoughts and another</seg><seg type="columnLine">and another, always building, always ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panding, until suddenly, he was remember-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Les Gunther and Breckinridge and old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nate and he was remembering the twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagons in the * little valley. The farmers</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were going to claim free land, land that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was already claimed by Bvran, the cattle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor was fumbling with his ban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dages. "Thinking about something, son?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jane," Chet said. "Jane Bryan. She's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattleman's daughter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right," the doctor said, going on</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his work. "Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A cattleman's daughter," Chet Wains-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth said. "She saved my life."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Any reason why she shouldn't?" the doc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tor said, his voice firm and low and sure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chet thought of the cattleman who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed his father and mother and the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Bryan kept drumming against his ears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He squeezed his eyes tightly closed. "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, Doc," he said. "There's so damn</seg><seg type="columnLine">much I don't know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He opened his eyes and the doctor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring at him intently. "Admitting that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the first step toward learning something,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor said quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER TWO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">An Eye for an Eye</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHET sat on a stump in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line shack, the good sun pouring</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his mending body. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a basin of warm water on his lap and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl was standing by him, her left hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the side of his cheek. She dipped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight razor in the basin and shook the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water free and smiled at him. "If shaving is</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a painful process," she said, "I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">think all men would wear full beards." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">razor scraped noisily against his cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I feel like a darn fool," Chet said. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never had a woman shave me before."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well," Jane Bryan said, "I've never</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaved a man before, so we're even."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why do you bother with me?" Chet</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl looked at him intently. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue eyes, the kind of blue that sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes in the twilight when the shadows lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickly against a bushy slope. "Curiosity,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said, and he knew it was more than that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I want to see what you look like under that</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard." She puffed out one cheek, distorting</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face. "Do that," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt a soft, langorous contentment such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he had never known in his life, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a wedge, splitting his peace of mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the thought of the settlers who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken their wagons into the valley. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoided talking about it, but now he had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. "What happened that night?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "The night you found me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She paused now and looked straight into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes. "A band of raiders shot up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town and tried to rob the bank."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tried?" he said quickly. "They didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away with it?"	'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was still watching him closely, try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to read his thoughts. "No one accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">RIDE WITH THE GUNSMOKE JUDAS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">19</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">plishes anything by force," she said. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited for him to argue that, and when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't, she said, "Doc Acton was ready for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doc Acton?" he said, puzzled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doc is the marshal as well as the town</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor," she said. She moved directly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of him and spoke as if she wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock him into some confession. "Doc</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed two of them." She waited expectantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he held his questions, grimly silent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"One man was quite short," she said. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had red hair. The other was a fat man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">two fingers missing on his left hand."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clunny and Breckinridge, he thought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. He felt no real emotion. "I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking about the farmers," he said. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">about them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw the gladness come into her eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They're your people, aren't they?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have no people," he said brusquely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You talked a lot when you were uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious," she said quietly. "I know they're</seg><seg type="columnLine">your people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stared at her, wondering how much he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had said, wondering how much she knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and suddenly, he was seeing her as a cat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tleman's daughter prying into his affairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why did you save me? he said. "So your</seg><seg type="columnLine">dad would have somebody to hang in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of Main Street?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no responding anger in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes but there was something deeper, a hurt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If my father knew you were here, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be alive," she said softly. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hates nesters the same way you hate cattle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, and just as unreasonably." She turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly, hearing a sound down the slope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and following her gaze, he saw the six riders</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the flats below them. She snatched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">basin from his lap and spilled the water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Get in the cabin," she commanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got nothing to run from," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deep anger in him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing but a lynch rope," she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Get in the cabin!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood up quickly and felt the pain in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his side and realized he would be completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless to defend himself. Reluctantly, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the cabin and closed the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood there, breathing heavily, remembering</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Nate's warning that he would be an out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast, hated by nester and cattlemen alike,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted by the law. ...</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a breech loading rifle hanging</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on pegs on the wall and underneath, a box</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shells on a little shelf. He took the gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">and loaded it and stood by the front win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow, peering between the rough curtains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The riders were coming slowly up the hill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">led by a giant of a man with a fierce red</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard. Chet's mouth went dry and an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatred consumed him. All the men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed with rifles and they had six-shooters</seg><seg type="columnLine">belted around their middles. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">coils of rope on their saddles. He saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl standing there in front of the door, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms folded, a completely defiant figure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The red-bearded man reined up close to her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've come to take you home, Jane," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not going, father," the girl said</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly.

If she won't get on it, put her on</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A thick-set, brutish man rode forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading a saddle horse. "You better come</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, Jane," the man called Stinson said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was grinning wolfishly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," the girl said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I said put her on the horse, Stinson,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pete Bryan said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stinson stepped out of his saddle. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thick man, his sleeves rolled back to expose</seg><seg type="columnLine">hairy arms. He started moving toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl and Chet, from his vantage point, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see a growing excitement in the man's eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he passed by. Then, he stood beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl and grinned. "Don't run from me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jane," he said. "I've got your dad's per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission this time." He reached out quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and put both arms around the girl, pulling</seg><seg type="columnLine">her close to his own body, deliberately pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longing the struggle. The glass crashed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chet Wainworth pushed the rifle barrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">through.	* .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get your hands off her, Stinson," Chet</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT THAT moment Big Sam, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">-f*- been out gathering wood, came around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner of the cabin. He stopped dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">still, his eyes going wide, and then he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bellow of rage. He rushed in and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mammoth arms gripped Stinson from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind. Lifting the heavy man as if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a child, he smashed him down against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">20</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIFTEEN WESTERN TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Big* Sam's chest was heaving, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild.

Then the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved directly between him and her father</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Big Sam's hand reached into the waist</seg><seg type="columnLine">band of his trousers and came up with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocked six-shooter.

If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Sam and Doc Acton go on protecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em, Jane, I'll count you as one of them."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right, father," the girl said quietly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then we know how we stand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sound that was half way between a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curse and a sob broke across Pete Bryan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips. He wheeled his horse savagely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">signaled to his men with a wave of his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He rode back down the slope toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flats, spurring his horse wickedly, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">riders followed him. A deathly quiet set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled around the little line shack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl ran a short distance, as if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would follow her father, then stopped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood with her hands gripped at her sides.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was sobbing so bitterly that Chet could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear her. He leaned the rifle against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall and walked out into the sunshine. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a fool to get mixed up in it, Sam," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "There was no need of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mammoth man looked at Jane Bryan</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he looked at Chet Wainsworth. "What-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever Miss Jane does is right, Mr. Chet,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam murmured. "I like to be right. It's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only way a man can live with himself." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust the six shooter back in his waist band</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walked rapidly around the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time, Chet Wainworth stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly behind the girl as the memories that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were part dreams and part realities became</seg><seg type="columnLine">totally real. In his mind, she was standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him, bathing his face, pressing cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">towels against his forehead. The memory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes was strong on him.. Then he broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from his thoughts and said "I'm sorry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jane, Your father won't change and neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">will I. What I said just now was the truth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm not a farmer looking for land-. I'm one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Les Gunther's raiders. I'm an outlaw and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a killer and it makes no difference to me if</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man runs cows or digs in the dirt just so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">get what I'm after."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned swiftly and she was facing him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tears bright in her eyes, the torment that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in her plain on her face. "That isn't so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chet," she said. "I told you you talked a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you were unconscious. I sat by your</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed and held your hand and you talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me as if you knew I was there. You told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me everything you believed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A man can lie," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shook her head slowly.

"And you had</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked about it before with a girl. A girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">named Lorraine Pettigrew."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HIS nostrils flared and the muscles were</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight knots at the butts of his jaw. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had talked, then. And he had told the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth. The real truth that lay deep within</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, smouldering and churning, the dream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace that was at constant war with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatreds and his thirst for revenge. "I lied</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her then," he said. "I told her what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to hear." There was deep resentment</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his voice. "I've ridden a long ways, Jane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my one thought was to kill your father.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anything I have done or said was building</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward that one thing. I came here for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that reason and that reason alone. If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought yoii could change me, I'm sorry</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it, because you can't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't change you," she said, "but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man can change himself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a woman's way of thinking," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's broken a lot of hearts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She seemed tired--too completely tired to</seg><seg type="columnLine">even raise her voice. "You fool," she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">sadly. "You pitiful men. You and my father</seg><seg type="columnLine">both. If you kill my father will it end your</seg><seg type="columnLine">memories? If he kills you will he sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">better?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pete Bryan sleeps well," he said, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he eats well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shook her head. "There's no under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing in you, is there?" she said. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't see that what tortures you could tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture another man do you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know what I know," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you?" she said. "Do you know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my father made a mistake once because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed a lie? Do you know that he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother--a brother he loved very much? My</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle. My uncle was found there in Kansas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripped, beaten and hanging from a limb.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some said it was the farmers who did it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my father was part of a band that killed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaughtered "nd burned because of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She moved in front of Chet Wainworth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made him meet her eyes. "My father</seg><seg type="columnLine">has never had a full night's sleep since, Chet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wainworth. I've seen him sit in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire by the hour, rubbing his hands together,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">twisting them and turning them, trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rub the blood away. And instead of getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on his knees and admitting his mistake</seg><seg type="columnLine">to God, he keeps lighting, swearing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">every farmer that ever lived brought this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing on him when it's only his own con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">science that bothers him." A short sob broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">her voice and she shrugged her shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if it didn't matter any more. "Go ahead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chet Wainworth. Take a horse from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corral. I'll give you your gun belt and your</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun and I'll give you the rifle and the am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munition, too, because you'll need it. Go</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, Chet Wainworth, keep building a fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">under you revenge and your hatred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometime when it has consumed you com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely, think of Lorraine Pettigrew and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream you had--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tears spilled over and she ran toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin. She paused at the doorway and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at him briefly. "And think of me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said bitterly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She hurried inside the cabin and threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his gun belt and his six-shooter and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle and its shells. They landed in the dirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the yard and the cartridges scattered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had to pick them out of the dust. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door slammed and through the shattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">window, he could hear her sobbing. Chet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wainworth took the weapons and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking slowly toward the corral. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Sam standing there, waiting for him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then he saw the saddled and badly used</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse in the corral. Presently Doc Acton</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out of the shed and started unsaddling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horse. He didn't look at Chet Wain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth. He spoke across his shoulder. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving, Chet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You intend to stop me, law man?" Chet</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doc Acton turned and looked steadily at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chet, his cavernous eyes serious, his thin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn face grey with tiredness. "Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chet?" he asked. "Do you want t&lt;3 be</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I seem to have-run off at the mouth,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chet said. "I figured maybe you'd want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a hero. You could set up a scaffold in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main street, of *the town, hang me and leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">me there for a day or so. That ought to set</seg><seg type="columnLine">you in pretty good with Pete Bryan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose it would," Doc AGton said. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose it would at that." He stared stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily at Chet. "But I'm most interested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting good with myself, Chet. That bay</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is a good horse. You'll find what's</seg><seg type="columnLine">22</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIFTEEN WESTERN TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">left of the settlers in the little valley at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the canyon and I reckon you'll find</seg><seg type="columnLine">Les Gunther there too. They're about ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a leader fike him, in spite of anything I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can tell them." He turned, ignoring Chet</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely. "Or maybe you'd do as their</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader, Chet. Sam will saddle up for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Big Sam moved woodenly. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great weight inside Big Sam. It puzzled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tormented him. Big Sam's thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were simple and direct. He had seen Jane</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bryan cry softly in the night during that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time when they didn't know if Chet Wain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth would live or die. He had seen Jane</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bryan stand against her own father be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of Chet Wainworth. That was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty big thing to Sam. That was a wom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">an, choosing her man, standing against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world because of her man. That was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">biggest thing there was, Sam figured. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head. "I hope you know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're doin', Mr. Chet," he said. "You bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter know, Mr. Chet, because if you don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, I reckon I'm gonna have to kill you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHET rode away from the cabin slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had put an arrogant set to his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders for he wanted to show his contempt for</seg><seg type="columnLine">these people who seemed to be obsessed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea that the world could be right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was fighting hard now to protect him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, knowing that if he let down for even a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment--if he dared to discuss this thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Doc Acton--he might be forever lost.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again it was that old childhood struggle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the complete inability to understand wheth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er a man should claim an eye for an eye or</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether a man should turn the other cheek.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He rode away and when he was out of sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cabin, his shoulders slumped and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain inside him hurt him until he wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry like a baby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made himself think of that night in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kansas and of those burning cabins and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meetings that had followed. He saw again</seg><seg type="columnLine">Les Gunther standing on a box shouting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">curse against all cattlemen into the torch</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted night. Such talk had been food once</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Chet Wainworth, and balm for his grief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had been blood in his veins -y the something</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man needed, to go on. A man had to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cause and a belief, and a strong belief was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one that was sired by blood and revenge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the blind charge behind a flag.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chet's shoulders pained him. Perspira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was thick on his face and it ran down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his neck and down the crease of his back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He thought of Jane Bryan, and not wanting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think of her, immediately thought of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own father and mother and how they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived and worked together, always striving</seg><seg type="columnLine">for something, always struggling. And get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting nothing, he thought bitterly. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but flame and death for a lifetime of effort.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And immediately he knew that was a lie.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had had each other: they had had their</seg><seg type="columnLine">happiness. They too had had a belief, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause to follow, and they had followed it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A belief that was imbedded in basic love.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If fate had been cruel to them, he supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, in their way, they had turned the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheek and built upon those disappointments</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gone on. But damn it, they were dead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or were they?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came at last to the canyon and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraps and remnants of the campsite where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had broken with Les Gunther. Down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail, he saw the very spot where Breckin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge had shot and wounded him and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the place in the trail where he had fallen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It gave him a feeling of great apartness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sat there on his horse and stared down</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the spot where for a time, at least, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lain in death. It was as if, suddenly, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become two different people; one the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell there on the ground, the other this</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole man riding a horse and trying to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a decision. The feeling obsessed- him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tormented him until it was almost as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a choice to make, right here, in this very</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. He could pick up that dead body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that empty shell, and wear it again and ride</seg><seg type="columnLine">on; or he could leave it there in the trail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">start anew, and make his decisions all over,,</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. He rode down the trail, glad to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">rid of the feeling that had been so strong on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little valley was a pleasant place. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass carpet was sprinkled with wild flow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers that blared in the bright sunlight. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">now there was a feeling of tension and ha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tred that sullied the very air. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">two wagons there in the valley, two out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve. Suddenly, Chet knew the tragedy</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had hit this band of settlers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spurred his horse into a run, forgetting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pain in his shoulder, and he searched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faces upturned toward him. He counted</seg><seg type="columnLine">them by the dead rather than by the living.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ten men missing, ten out of nineteen. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the women around the community cook</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire and by reading their faces he kew his</seg><seg type="columnLine">RIDE WITH THE GUNSMOKE JUDAS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">count had been correct. He dismounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffly and stood there, waiting to be invited</seg><seg type="columnLine">in or rejected, not knowing which it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be. Old Luke Pettigrew came forward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Chet Wainworth," he said. "Thank God</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're alive. How about Mr. Gunther and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The title of respect told Chet that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">people hadn't recognized their betrayal by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunther. They still believed Les Gunther</seg><seg type="columnLine">was their leader and that he had fought for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and been driven off. "I got separated</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the others," Chet said. "I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how they are, except that Breckinridge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cluny are dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good men, both," Pettigrew said. "Damn</seg><seg type="columnLine">good men." His white beard trembled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rage and he shook his fist at his God.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If Les Gunther's alive, he's got ten more</seg><seg type="columnLine">teiders to ride with him, I promise you that!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ten more now, and in time, we'll have ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">times ten, because there'll never be no peace</seg><seg type="columnLine">until every cattleman is driven off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plains."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was muttered assent, and glancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the men, Chet recalled again that first</seg><seg type="columnLine">night when Les Guther had talked his way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was the dream stuff, the building of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, the ideal that blinded a man until there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no right except this one way. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a forward movement without thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stampede without reason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw Lorraine Pettigrew detach herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the group by the fire and walk toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the wagons. He went to her and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up at him, her gladness unmasked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her soft, brown eyes. "I've prayed for you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chet," she said quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER THREE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Their Type of Man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE TOOK her arm and walked away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the wagon, across the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little valley where the wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers were thick and the deep, moist heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of late spring lay over everything. The fra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grance of 1'ie grass and growth was in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">nostrils, needing only the scent of newly</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned sod to make a completeness. "It must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been bad," he said, nodding his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the wagons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was terrible, Chet," she said. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were met by. a blast of rifle fire." Her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew puzzled. "If you and Mr. Gunther</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and the others could have gotten to us--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took both her shoulders and turned her</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him. "Look at me, Lorraine," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Look at me and listen. I couldn't get</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you because I wasn't there in the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. Breckinridge shot me because I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to quit Gunther's band."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quit?" she said, not believing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gunther had no intention of helping' you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wanted to rob the town, get what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get and go on. Gunther doesn't care</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether you ever get that land or not. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't care about anything except himself."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw the disbelief in her eyes and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that Was almost anger. "You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no right to talk that way about a man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">has dedicated his life to helping us," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Why do you talk this way?".</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Because it's the truth," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stared at him, wanting to believe him</seg><seg type="columnLine">because she loved him, not wanting to be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve him because, if he were telling the truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">then everything they had done was wrong.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But Pete Bryan," she said. "You told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him and of how you had to fight him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How you could never rest until you found</seg><seg type="columnLine">him--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I found him," he said. "And it was Pete</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bryan's daughter who saved my life."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lorraine Pettigrew was staring deep into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes. She smiled, but it was a smile that</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembled. "I see," she said softly. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned quickly so that Chet could not see</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face. "I bless her for helping you, Chet,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stayed in the camp that night and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fed and treated like a hero, for no one but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lorraine knew that he had tried to desert</seg><seg type="columnLine">Les Gunther's band and the name of Les</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunther was on every tongue, almost like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If Les Gunther got away, he'll be back,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Luke Pettigrew said.

Wherever</seg><seg type="columnLine">there1 s a cow on free grass, we'll move."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chet Wainworth listened, a sickening con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viction growing within him. Old Nate Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liams had been right. He was an outcast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even among his own people, for, as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they discovered that he had turned against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Les Gunther, they would turn 09 him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a savage hatred. For they were strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">24</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIFTEEN WESTERN TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">these settlers. They-were individuals, every</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them, and yet they could be happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">only in a group. They started making laws</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they unpacked their wagons, for they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a peaceful people, but if any man broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of their laws, their justice was wickedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift. They avoided trouble and violence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but if trouble and violence came to them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could fight back with the ruthlessness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an Indian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll wait two more days," Luke Petti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew said. "If Les Gunther ain't back by</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, I say we go it alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We need a leader," Pers Legal said. "A</seg><seg type="columnLine">man can't jump on his horse and go off in</seg><seg type="columnLine">six directions all at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've gol Chet Wainworth," another</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "You, Mary, pour Chet Wainworth</seg><seg type="columnLine">another cup of coffee."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Chet Wainworth is the likely one," Luke</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pettigrew said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chet drank his coffee and stared at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire and the warm glow of being wanted as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a leader fell across him like a warm shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then, was gone. "Maybe if we formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a committee," Chet'said carefully. "Maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we went under a flag of truce and talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Pete Bryan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a long silence and then Luke</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pettigrew laughed uproariously and slapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knee. "Danged if you ain't got the sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of humor, Chet Wainworth! You're shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">half to hell but you-can still joke!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rest of the men roared their laughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it filtered out across the valley, a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound mingling finally with the weeping of</seg><seg type="columnLine">women whose husbands were dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, for two days they waited, their impa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tience growing as they saw their horses and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their cattle strip the little meadow clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw their own food supply dwindle away</seg><seg type="columnLine">to nothing. During those two days, Chet</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard much of the way Doc Acton and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nameless giant had helped after the battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in the valley. If it hadn't been for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, they all agreed, they could have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">trapped and wiped out. The giant had</seg><seg type="columnLine">packed in additional food and the doctor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken care of the wounded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Doc worked as hard as if he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gonna be paid for it," one man said. "How</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man as fine as him can stomach livin' in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cow town, is more than I can see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The only reason he helped us is because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's got an eye for business," Luke Petti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew said,^always the cynical one. "He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">knows if us farmers move in here there'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">that much more business for him." Luke</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed shortly. "Farmers have lots of</seg><seg type="columnLine">kids."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chet got up and moved away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. Then he saw Lorraine Pettigtew com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing across toward him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TT WAS difficult for him to talk to Lor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raine now, for there seemed to be so lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle he could say to her. Every time he tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk to her he found himself wanting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain about Jane Bryan. He wanted des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perately to discuss his feelings with her, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way he knew he could have discussed them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Doc Acton or with Jane herself. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no such basis of discussion with Lorraine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he found himself suddenly lonely when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was with her. '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They walked together silently, arm in arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they were a good distance from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp. Lorraine stopped suddenly. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pretty girl. A small breeze stirred her</seg><seg type="columnLine">chestnut hair. She looked up at him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said quite seriously, "You've never kissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, Chet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A man don't make a promise until he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure he can keep it," Chet said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kiss me," she whispered, and she moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to him and tilted her face toward him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he could feel the warmth of her, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">longing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had dreamed of this girl a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">nights and he had seen her in the flame of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his campfire. The fragrance of her flesh was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a memory in his nostrils and sometimes he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of her with a savage, man hunger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a swift second, the possibility of fulfill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment was there in his eyes and she saw it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and waited expectantly and then she saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light die. He leaned forward and kissed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the lips without taking her in his arms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She closed her eyes lightly and he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the two tiny tears that squeezed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">between her lids. "Thank you, Chet,"' she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "It's not a promise. Don't ever think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it as such.'''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned and ran quickly back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon and he stood there, tormented in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, knowing that in some way he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt her, not knowing exactly how.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A tremendous tumult rose over by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp. Chet looked that way and saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse running erratically down the slope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A man was clinging to the saddle, swaying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one side and then the other. One foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">RIDE WITH THE GUNSMOKE JUDAS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">25</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was out of the stirrup and the leg dangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if it had been shattered with an ax. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">choking fear rose inside Chet and he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">running headlong, stumbling across the close</seg><seg type="columnLine">cropped ground. The rider's hat was gone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposing the iron grey hair. It was old Nate</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Because he had been further up the valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chet was able to reach Nate well ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men from the camp. He pulled the horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a stop and turned to help the old man out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the saddle, but he was too late. Nate had</seg><seg type="columnLine">already fallen. He hit the ground heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he lay there panting, blood bubbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">across his lips. He kept staring up at Chet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pupils round and bright. "I tried to quit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chet,'' he panted. "Glad to see vou made</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's Les?'''Chet demanded. "Kraft</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Metzger? They still with him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man fought to answer, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling wildly now. His tongue licked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood from his' lips. "Kraft, Metzger, Les,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "They're coming here. Les figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">he can organize a new band with these</seg><seg type="columnLine">men--" The old man coughed, fighting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath. "It's wrong, Chet. I tried to quit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After you left I knew I had to quit, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were right, Chet. Don't ever forget you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were right--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the last words Nate Williams said</seg><seg type="columnLine">or ever would say. The men from the camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">came running up, their breathing noisy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy in the sudden silence. "Nate Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liams, ain't it?" Luke Pettigrew said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"VVhat'd he say? What'd he say about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunther?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chet Wainworth turned and looked at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and he looked beyond them to the wag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ons and saw the women around the fire and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw Lorraine Pettigr?w standing alone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And suddenly he knew that this thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened was not a fight that belonged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to these people or to any other group. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight was a group fight, but a struggle that</seg><seg type="columnLine">started in the individual and then spread.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These folks were chips swept up in a tide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same way he had been swept up, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were wrong to be carried along this way</seg><seg type="columnLine">because they tvere not making up their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds to anything. They were letting some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one else do their thinking, and that, he real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized suddenly, was the same thing that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to Pete Bryan. He had let others</seg><seg type="columnLine">do his thinking and he had ridden along on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a raid and because Pete Bryan was a rich</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and powerful man, his name had been re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered when other names had been for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did Les Gunther say?" Luke Petti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew demanded again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He sent word for you folks to wait right</seg><seg type="columnLine">here," Chet Wainworth said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait?" Luke Pettigrew said. "Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll know by tomorrow," Chet Wain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth said. "I'll get word to you." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">started toward where his horse was picketed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you?" Luke Pettigrew said. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you aim to do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I aim to go see Les Gunther," Chet said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Him and me have got a couple of things</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk over."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good!" Luke Pettigrew said explosively.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then we can get things straightened out</seg><seg type="columnLine">around here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's what I figger," Chet Wainworth</seg><seg type="columnLine">said softly. "You take good care of Lor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raine, Luke."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TTE WAS able to back track old Nate's</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse far enough to make sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nate had ridden down the canyon. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">there he rode by guess and hope until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to Les Gunther's original campsite and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there again he picked up the trail and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it led across the hogback down toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line cabin where Jane Bryan and Doc</seg><seg type="columnLine">Acton and Big Sam had been staying. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a quickening of his pulse as he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Jane, but his real mission drove the emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He would circle around the cabin, he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided. He didn't want Jane nor the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see him, for he knew now that this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing he would have to settle alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dropped into the swale and climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the low, rolling hill, and had reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top before he heard the first crack of rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire coming from a great distance. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">reined up sharply, a sickening panic inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and then he sunk his spurs and rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">furiously down the slope, his urgency put-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting all thoughts of bodily pain from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently he came to the clearing. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see across to the line shack and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corral, a good distance away, and now there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a rapid firing from the side window of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin which he recognized as pistol shots.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The answering fire from the corral was slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and confident. Nearer, on this side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">26</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIFTEEN WESTERN TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin, he saw three horses and knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them was Les Gunther's grulla dun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The horses stood spread legged, heads down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had been ridden to death and that ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained to him the reason for Les Gunther's</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop here at the line shack. "Why in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil didn't you give him horses, if that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he wanted?" Chet thought fiercely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why did you have to get mixed up in this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw a man run from one cover to an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other out there in the corral and he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">he recognized the man as Metzger. Chet</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked his rifle from the saddle boot, shoved</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a shell and rode straight in toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin, intending to thrust himself between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin and the men there in the corral.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment Les Gunther and Kraft</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke from cover and ran straight toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin, crouched low, ducking from side</seg><seg type="columnLine">to side. There was no answering fire from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin and Chet remembered with a sick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening realization that he had let Jane Bryan</seg><seg type="columnLine">give him the only rifle. Big Sam had a six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooter and probably not much ammunition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chet saw Gunther and Kraft plunging their</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders against the flimsy door as he raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward them and he was positive he heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman scream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chet threw himself from his horse, ripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">open the old wound in his shoulder. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the throbbing pain of it, felt the blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeping through his shirt. He ran on foot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rifle still gripped in his hand, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was yelling Les Gunther's name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gunther half turned and in that second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door opened and Big Sam came rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, his tremendous fists flailing. "Stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, Sam," Chet yelled, unable to fire now</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fear of-hitting Sam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Big Sam didn't hear. Miss Jane was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in danger and Big Sam knew only one thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do. Chet saw the big man's hands lock</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Kraft's neck. He saw Kraft jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ground and swung from side to</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and then Sam threw him half way across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yard. Kraft lit in a crumpled heap, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck broken, and Sam turned toward Les</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunther.	v</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a muffled sound of a pistol shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Sam kept pushing forward, bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunther down to the ground, still fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">with every ounce of breath that was in him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chet heard Gunther scream. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">two shots from the corral and dust puffed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Big Sam's shirt as the bullets tore into</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Big Sam got to his feet and Les Gunther</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted inside the cabin. There were three</seg><seg type="columnLine">more shots from the corral and Big Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood there, taking the lead, shaking like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree under an ax with each smash of a bullet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He seemed to be totally blind and totally</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to realize his position. He started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk directly toward the rifle there in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corral. He walked with a steady, deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined gait that became a long shuffle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chet could stand it no longer. He too started</seg><seg type="columnLine">running toward the corral, calling Sam's</seg><seg type="columnLine">name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bullets kicked around Chet's feet and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Sam had reached the corral fence. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to climb it. He got one foot on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom rail and that was as far as he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">go. He fell that way and hung across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence, his feet touching on one side, his finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">tips touching on the other. Chet threw him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self flat on the ground and started firing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reloading, firing again. He had never known</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was capable of the savage rage that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in him now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was the sound of furious struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside the cabin but no shots from that di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection. Over in the corral, Metzger was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting to keep cover behind a double cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner post. Chet saw the man's shoulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He snapped to his feet, threw the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Springfield to his shoulder and fired. Metzger</seg><seg type="columnLine">spun out from behind the post, gripping his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, and Chet fired again. Metzger</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell and Chet loaded and deliberately put</seg><seg type="columnLine">another shot into the man's body before</seg><seg type="columnLine">running toward the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Les Gunther had knocked Jane to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. At the sound of the door flinging open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he whirled to face Chet, a gun in his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chet swung the rifle barrel and crashed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">across Gunther's shoulder. The impact</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked the six-shooter out of Gunther's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and in the second he was off balance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chet swung the rifle again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time Gunther was ready. He reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and gripped the rifle barrel and twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">savagely, tearing it out of Chet's single hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip. Chet's left arm hung uselessly at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. An evil grin distorted Les Gunther's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. He came rushing in and Jane, there on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor, reached out and gripped one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ankles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gunther fell hard and Chet was on top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him, slugging with his right fist, beating</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the face of the man who had turned a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream into senseless slaughter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">RIDE WITH THE GUNSMOKE JUDAS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">27</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A DIZZYING blackness seeped over Chet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he could no longer tell what he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing. The pain of his wound and the weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of his sickness overcame him. He fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">against it and he heard his own breath sob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing in his lungs, trying to gulp in new</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength. He knew that Jane was there with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, fighting with him, doing what she could.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw Les Gunther's face and he smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fist against it and he knew he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">raise his arm again. There was not that</seg><seg type="columnLine">much endurance in a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he regained consciousness he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still there on the cabin floor. The place was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shambles, the planks blood-splattered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw Jane first, her clothing torn, her hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging loose, a wicked bruise spreading</seg><seg type="columnLine">across her cheek. She was kneeling beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, her hand caressing his face. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her, and knew he loved her, and knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that love was stronger than the hatred be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween a cattleman and a sodbuster. He real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized suddenly that there were other people</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the room. He turned his head and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly into the eyes of Pete Bryan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old cattleman stood there, his red</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard giving a fierceness to his appearance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his eyes now were the eyes of a defeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Pete Bryan too knew that love was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger than hate. He turned and stalked</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly out of the cabin, a man who, regard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less of what came, would have to keep his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doc Acton came forward then.

Chet asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had&lt;*one over to the settler's camp,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doc explained. "I cut through town to pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">up some things and missed you that way, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess. Jane and I decided that if we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the settlers up here to a meeting so we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could all talk we might be able to work out</seg><seg type="columnLine">something. We couldn't go to their camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">because Jane's dad was watching for that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I brought the settlers here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're here now?" Chet interrupted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're outside with Les Gunther," Doc</seg><seg type="columnLine">Acton said, and by the way he said it, Chet</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what it meant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "They decided to believe the truth about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunther," Chet said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Big Sam that made them decide,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doc Acton said. "Big Sam was a friend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. When Jane told them what Sam had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to do and how Gunther had shot him."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't talk any more," Jane said. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached out and smoothed Chet's hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Doc Acton got up and left the cabin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jane and Chet were alone. She leaned closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kissed him on the lips. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small sound that might have been a sob, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Jane and Chet looked up Lorraine</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pettigrew was standing there in the doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some instinct given only to women told</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jane the identity of this girl. Jane stood up</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, unable to meet the other girl's eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then she said quietly, "I'll go, Lorraine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's your place here with him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Lorraine Pettigrew managed a smile. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook her head slowly from side to side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, Jane," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "He told you?" Jane said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That's right," Lorraine Pettigrew said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now her smile was genuine. "He told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me." She turned and went outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On a tree, a hundred yards from the cabin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body of Les Gunther twisted slowly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of a rope. Luke Pettigrew and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other settlers stood silently, not proud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they had done and not ashamed. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were strong men, men who hated violence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but men who would never run from it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Pete Bryan saw them, and in this moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rough justice he understood them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew them to be men of his own calibre.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "If you come hellin' and roarin' back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">that valley," Pete Bryan said, "me and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys will meet you with hellin' and roarin'.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And if you think we give you a fight the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, wait'll you see the next one." He spat</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his red beard. "If you come into</seg><seg type="columnLine">that valley quiet and peaceful like decent</seg><seg type="columnLine">folks," he said, "you'll be treated like de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent folks.

"Oh, when will this country start</seg><seg type="columnLine">being civilized?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pamela answered as Mattie knew she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would. &lt;lBon't you see, honey?" she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her voice was low, soft, intense, "That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">why Andy's standing up to Bob Dell.

She rushed blindly, not knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">where she was going.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then she wheeled suddenly, held up her</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirts above the dust of the littered street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodged between two teams, and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the street toward the courthouse. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossing she met Mr. Stapleton, the T &amp; P</seg><seg type="columnLine">stationmaster, who bowed and tipped his hat</seg><seg type="columnLine">politely but she hurried past him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Zack Burnside, Andrew's only deputy, also</seg><seg type="columnLine">jailer, was alone in the sheriff's office. Tilted</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in his chair, with his feet on the desk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was reading an El Paso newspaper. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw him gulp and hastily remove his booted</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet from the desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, howdy, Miz Cameron. This here's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a unexpected pleasure." Zack said uncom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortably. He lurched to his feet, removed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">battered hat to expose a damp fringe of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouse-colored hair around a bald pate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">startling whiteness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is Mr. Cameron around anywhere?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, trying to smile. She never referred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andrew by his first name in public and sel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom came to the office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, no ma'am. I'm afraid he ain't."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zack answered slowly. "Seems like he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was goin' over to Sam Sawyer's Hver'</seg><seg type="columnLine">stable. Somebody stole a set of harness off</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam th' other night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something told her Zack was lying. An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew was somewhere else, keeping an eye on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob Dell, watching to see if Dell left town</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not, making sure no trouble broke out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She came to the point with a swiftness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">left Zack no defense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "How long did he give Bob Dell to get out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of town?" Her voice was hard and.brittle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One o'clock." Zack looked distressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fingered his bald spot nervously. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he unconsciously hitched up the heavy pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sagged at his belt. He frowned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at the worn toes of his dusty boots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What time is it now, Zack?" she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Zack tugged out a thick silver cased watch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sprung open the cover and deliberately</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied the dial." One minute before ten,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. Not many men had watches in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Painted Rock but Zack was one who did.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clocks were scarce, too, in this frontier coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try. Such things were expensive luxuries.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An idea began to form in Mattie's mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Do you think Dell will leave?" she asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No ma'am. I don't." Zack's tone was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">blunt, his voice ro\igh with some deep emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. He continued to stare at his boots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then there's no way to stop it?" she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopelessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zack shook his head. "Not unless Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves town before one there ain't. Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cameron never changes his mind or loses his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve. If Bob ain't gone at one, he'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">right out there by them South steps, lookin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">for 'im, like he told Bob this mornin'." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted his head and she looked into his eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes that held that faded, bleak look she saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the eyes of so many Western men .. . and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hated every time she saw it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She tried another possibility. "Is Judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">Musgrove upstairs?" She indicated the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trict court room on the second floor over</seg><seg type="columnLine">their heads. The old judge, with his calm</seg><seg type="columnLine">good sense, might know how to prevent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, ma'am. Court ain't in session this</seg><seg type="columnLine">week an' I guess he's out at his ranch lookin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">after things." Zack took a deep breath. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on. "I reckon I know how you feel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miz Cameron. But they ain't anything any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body can do t' stop it. Andy told 'im t' leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' if he don't pull freight outa here by one</seg><seg type="columnLine">--well--there'll be trouble. But I'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">around t' make certain everything's fair."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He paused and looked away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There it was. The Western code. Nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">could interfere to stop a gunfight once it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fated. All anyone could do was "be around</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make certain everything was fair." But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there wasn't anything fair about this. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it and Zack knew it . . . and Bob Dell</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew'it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wearily she turned away. "Thank you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zack. It's nice to know you'll be around ..."</seg><seg type="columnLine">she swallowed . . . "To be sure everything's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair." She went out, aimlessly and halted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barren emptiness of the deserted corri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dor. Down the corridor, she could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices in the county clerk's office but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew no one there she 'wanted to see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One o'clock. The fateful words rocketed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through her mind. One o'clock. One o'clock!</seg><seg type="columnLine">One o'clock! Clock! Clock!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN the idea came to her. A plan so</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate she hardly dared believe it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might succeed. She darted a quick glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into the sheriff's office to see if Zack</seg><seg type="columnLine">were watching her but he had already re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated himself and was staring at the El</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paso paper again with a troubled expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DEADLY SECOND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">31</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on his tanned face. She gathered her skirts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stole quickly up the stairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she reached the upper floor, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignored the closed doors of the courtroom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she hurried instead to the ladder leading to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attic which opened into the clock tower.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She scrambled breathlessly up the ladder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crouched in the hot darkness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attic, feeling for the narrow plank walk laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the rafters that led to the base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sqfiare tower containing the huge clock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the second time she'd been there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once, only a year before, when the court-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house had .just been completed and the clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being installed and tested Andrew had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought her, his bride, up to see its great</seg><seg type="columnLine">gears and mechanism at close range. They'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">even watched, by lamplight, while the clock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">smith who'd come all the way from Philadel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phia, had installed the clock and adjusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hands of the four faces so they'd keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fumbling in the semi-darkness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower's base, she found the heavy key, a steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft two feet long with a square end that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitted into the winding gear. She hefted it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her hand, wondering if it would serve her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose. She started the swing that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">smash the gears of the clock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, slowly, sick with dismay, she low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the heavy "key.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To smash the clock and stop it would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplish her purpose.

She realized her entire plan was founded</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a slender thread of Time--ten minutes--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if the thread snapped -- She shook her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, refusing to think.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had his meal ready even before she</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard his firm step on the little front porch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then there he was, looming big and tall in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiny dining room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Howdy, honey," he greeted her quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she ran for his kiss, holding him to her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling the hard muscles of his arms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest.

"How is it</seg><seg type="columnLine">today, Andrew?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was taking off his coat, then the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt with the big gun and cartridges.

Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was offering her the meat platter, holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">it carefully in a big, brown hand. Not awk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wardly but competently and carefully. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked at his broad forehead.

It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strong man's nose, high arched but perfect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly straight. And on each side of it, two faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines were beginning to etch themselves down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cheeks toward the corners of the wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm mouth. It was the face of a strong man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a leader, the face of a man to inspire con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DEADLY SECOND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">33</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fidence--and hold it. As he turned his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was something commanding in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement. Then he smiled, showing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, even teeth she had always admired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The words they exchanged were routine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">casual. Andrew was not a talkative man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she always tried to match his mood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How you feel, honey?" His voice, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a big man, was not especially deep but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had a pleasant resonance that always</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrilled her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, all right. Just fine. Try the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">beans." She held the bowl toward him. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't get many more unless it rains." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">beans had come from their own little garden</seg><seg type="columnLine">patch, carefully tended in the backyard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're good!" he complimented, chew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. His eyes were watching her. She noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd hardly taken his eyes from, her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">since he'd entered the house. One o'clock!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He, too, was probably thinking this might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">all they'd ever have together--just one won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful year. Yes, that was it. Why his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on her so constantly. Like his eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">memorizing her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She realized then he'd stopped eating, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just sitting there looking at her, quietly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to say something, appeared to change</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind and picked up his fork again, han-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dling it carefully because of his sore arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "More steak?" She pushed the plate to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward him invitingly. He shook his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then how about some hot coffee?" She</seg><seg type="columnLine">refilled his cup carefully and set the pot back</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the s'tove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She sat back down and toyed with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">food, not eating, almost shuddering at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of food. She looked up and met his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes again. There was love and kindness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great hunger in them . . . and sadness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Andrew," she choked. "What made you</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the job as sheriff?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A flicker of something came over his face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then it was gone and he was composed</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. But there was a strange darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Somebody had to.

"Sure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Plenty of others. But most of 'em were too</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick on the trigger or liked the bottle too</seg><seg type="columnLine">well or. . . He paused and she saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleak expression she hated come into his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, that look she couldn't understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She didn't know how far she dared to go.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In spite of the love between them there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something at times about Andrew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned her not to go too far, not to tamper</seg><seg type="columnLine">with man business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "This'll be my last term,".he said finally.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Think I might study law.

But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't. He didn't ever talk about such things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And if one o'clock meant the end, he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to worry her about it ahead of time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andrew was like that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They finished their meal and Andrew went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rest a few minutes in his big chair while</seg><seg type="columnLine">he read a book. The chair faced the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and through the front door the court-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house clock was clearly visible. She saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance at the clock as he sat down and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked too. The hands said seventeen min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes until one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She stacked the dishes quickly, then joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. She always waited until he'd left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house to do the dishes. She never tried, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">so many wives did, to impose on his mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culine pride by wheedling him into drying</seg><seg type="columnLine">them for her. She felt his few minutes at</seg><seg type="columnLine">home during the noon hour meant too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">to both of them to be wasted on such a trir</seg><seg type="columnLine">vial task. And today, of all days, she wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">every second of his companionship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As she sat, eyes alternating from the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant clock back to Andrew she took an em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">broidery hoop in her hands and made list-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less motions with a needle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She saw him glance up again, staring at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clock, then felt his gaze on her, felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce intensity of it. She steeled herself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain calm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then he was rising reluctantly to his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Almost one. Gotta go, honey." He stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">there for a moment, flexing the stiff fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his right hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She flew to him, suddenly wild. "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">go yet," she begged. She felt him drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. "Don't go," she whispered. She put</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the seduction and appeal at her command</seg><seg type="columnLine">into her invitation. "Stay here with me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">34</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIFTEEN WESTERN TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't go back this afternoon." She clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him, her body close against his, beg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE could feel him quiver; knew he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to stay. Then his hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">removing her arms from around his neck;</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently, but with a strength she could not re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sist. He kissed her tenderly, buckled on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun belt, slipped his coat on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All her life she had been contemptuous of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those useless, helpless women who sit -and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wring their hands in time of distress but now</seg><seg type="columnLine">she found herself doing it. Sinking down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of Andrew's big chair she sat, grip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping her hands together, staring at the clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the distant courthouse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hands of the clock now pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">squarely at one. That meant Andrew, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspecting the clock on the North face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast, was already at the courthouse, standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the South steps waiting for Bob Dell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And if her plan had worked ... as she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned . . . Bob Dell would still be in Tim's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bar, thinking he had ten or eleven minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">.eft . . . waiting . . . watching the slow min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes creeping past . . . and seeing Andrew</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing out there by the South steps waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was what she was counting on--Dell</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing Andrew there early, according to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of the clock's South face, standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">there . . . early; waiting for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She tried to project her thoughts into Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dell's mind; make him wonder, worry. Make</seg><seg type="columnLine">him weaken in the face of Andrew's calm ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance of confidence. Maybe his arm isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad after all. He looks too confident." That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">what she wanted Bob Dell to be thinking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself as he looked through the door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar and saw the sheriff over there waiting for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him . .. while the hands of the clock still had</seg><seg type="columnLine">several long minutes yet to creep before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the deadline . . . one o'clock. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose Bob Dell didn't weaken?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While she tortured her brain with these</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts, Mattie's own eyes were staring at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creeping hands of the same clock . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">the North face. In a breathless agony of un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainty, she watched those iron hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her lips moved silently as she counted off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow seconds and minutes, trying to steel her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self against the sound ... if it came. Finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">she shut her eyes, unable to look. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last she opened her eyes. There had</seg><seg type="columnLine">still been no sounds of shots. Fearfully she</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the clock. One-thirty!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then something broke inside of her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was running, out of the door, down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street . . . running frantically, all thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride or dignity forgotten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She found Andrew in the courthouse cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridor calmly talking with a group of men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he drew away from them when he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">her coming and came to meet her. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to pretend now but just opened his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His nerve broke. He left town."

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed also that the winning community should pay all expenses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In those days, it was as much as their lives were worth--let alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">their job. When Appomatox won, and news of the agreement got out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the citizens suggested elevating their leaders to even greater heights</seg><seg type="columnLine">top place on a lynch pole, to be exact. Only by making up the expenses</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their own pockets, did the people's servants survive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE</seg><seg type="columnLine">BUSHWHACK</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARGAIN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By RICHARD FERBER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A killer-for-hire and in need of a job could hardly turn down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that easy offer to make himself a hundred dollars .... merely by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shooting an unarmed lawman right where his suspenders cross!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JESSE HARDER tied the sorrel pony to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rail and took two long steps across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walk to the swinging doors of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon. Inside, he paused briefly, his tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">angular body relaxed, his eyes moving lei-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely about the almost empty saloon. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the long, wooden bar, the barkeep</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him indifferently; the two other cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomers, storekeepers by their dress, turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentarily to scrutinize him. Harder</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved up to the bar, nodded his head at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barkeep and dug in the pocket of his jean^</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a coin. He found one and felt it tenta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively. Except for a few smaller coins, it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed singularly alone.

And the barkeep was the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">. .. except for the shotgun under the bar and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right, safe opportunity to use it.

It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">late afternoon and the street was empty, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust lying thick but undisturbed. He stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it for a long time, then sighed and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">back abruptly to the two men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will one of you tell the sheriff I want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The smaller man looked start'ed for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and then shrugged his shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's like I say, mister, on a day like this</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ain't likely to want to be waked up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jesse smiled thinly, but there was a look</seg><seg type="columnLine">of impatience on his face.

Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, though. In some other town where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't known, or was already forgotten.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had moved to a table in the saloon now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two brothers arranged their chairs so</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were facing Harder.

"You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man who comes right to the point." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled, exposing the gold teeth, and glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">warily around the saloon. "There's a man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beeker's Gulch, a sheriff.

Jesse said. He looked over at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexican and found him staring at him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">black, expressionless eyes. "This Mex here</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to be able to do the job, even if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">has to use an alley."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mexican started out of his chair, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a look from Cole Tolman he sank back</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. His mouth was set in a cruel, menac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sneer and his lips twitched for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, but he didn't speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're known in Beeker's," Cole said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's too risky.

"The price will be high."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We figured a hundred dollars," Cole said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaning back in his chair and folding his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands over the fatness of his belly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's too low.

The sack of tobacco was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty, only a few grains left. There wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for a good smoke. He was trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring his hand down again unobserved when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*And now to my nephew, Eugene, I leave my bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of WiIdroot Ofeam-Oil, my hairs best friend!//</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you* wm's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BEST FR/END</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">America's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Favorite</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Hair Tonic!</seg><seg type="columnLine">38</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIFTEEN WESTERN TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack Tolman threw a sack onto the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the table. As he did so Cole said: "A hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred dollars, Harder."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jesse looked at the sack and then at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's face. It wasn't a decent price; not</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he was used to. He shouldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown Cole and Jack Tolman that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of tobacco. But they were no dummies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One look at him had told them he was hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. He sighed heavily, moved his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly across the table, and picked up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bag of tobacco. He rolled the smoke deftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">but carefully and when he was about to lick</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paper down, he looked up suddenly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two brothers. They were watching him</seg><seg type="columnLine">patiently, but there was a flicker of amuse-,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment in their eyes. Jesse licked the paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, twisted the end and put it in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. He scratched a match under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table with a long, sweeping motion and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up at the men again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A hundred dollars," he said disgustedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine, fine," Cole said, leaning across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table. He spoke in a lower voice now. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">name's Mark Clayburn. We don't care how</seg><seg type="columnLine">you do it, as long as we're not figured up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it. Beeker's Gulch is about fifty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">north of here. We'll ride up with you to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow as far as The Forks and make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp. You got all the next day to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">your move. We'll meet you again that night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the east side of town there's a cotton-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood grove, near the river. There's an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken-down fence that some nester put up</seg><seg type="columnLine">once. You can't miss it. We'll pay you off</seg><seg type="columnLine">there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jesse sat up straighter in his chair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared reflectively at a spot somewhat above</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cole Tolman's head. His eyes narrowed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little and a thin smile came on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll be there, Mister Tolman?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">»aid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mexican came up out of his chair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His hand rested on his pant leg, in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tooled gun holster, poised and ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit down," Cole Tolman snapped. Jesse</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled broadly at the Mexican but there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no humor in his eyes. Ramos hesitated for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment and sat down again, but his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained tense and rigid. The two brothers</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood up then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll be there," Cole Tolman said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know you will," Jesse said without</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking up at them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But remember," Cole said, "this is your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">show.

Jesse said, and met the stare</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the other man. Cole Tolman watched him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment, a sure unfriendliness showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his eyes, then nodded his head and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three men moved away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jesse watched them thread their way</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the tables and go out the door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saloon. For a split second, he wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">why the Tolman brothers wanted the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff of Beeker's Gulch killed, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed the thought back. He didn't want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was the only code that ha had, if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could call it a code. It was a simple thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kill a man, and knowing why it had to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done only complicated the matter. It made</seg><seg type="columnLine">you think, and in his business he had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided long ago that to think was a thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be avoided. He got up slowly, took the sack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tobacco from the table, and went out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saloon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY rode out the next day and that eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning made camp at The Forks, in the low</seg><seg type="columnLine">foothills where the Maria fanned out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">three smaller, more sluggish streams. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">next morning he had taken his time in cover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the remaining ten miles to the little town</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Beeker's Gulch. He had ridden into it</seg><seg type="columnLine">that afternoon, down the only street, indif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent to the houses and buildings and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">few people that he saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even now in the saloon, while he waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">for old Mark Clayburn, the sheriff, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a manner of total indifference about him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He seemed oblivious even to the barkeep and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hidden shotgun. It had taken him many</seg><seg type="columnLine">years to develop this indifference, but he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done it well, so that now, they hardly seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">like people to him, but more like the stray</seg><seg type="columnLine">cow that he passed on the trail, an unknown,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cardboard figure on the landscape. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned long ago that the less he knew, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">less he would care.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But still, sitting in this saloon, in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">town that he didn't know, and where he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet known, a faint curiosity was working</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the back of his brain. He thought of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man that he was going to kill, old Mark</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clayburn and that all he knew about him</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that he was an old man with a fondness</seg><seg type="columnLine">for sleeping in the afternoon. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more to a man than that. And what had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">done that. Cole and lack Tolman and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BUSHWHACK BARGAIN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">little greaser Ramos should want him killed?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And once he was killed, who would care? A</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife? A family? There were many questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">that needed answers and suddenly, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time that he could remember, he won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered at those answers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But outside, he heard the tapping steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the board walk and he knew that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too late. It was too bad maybe, but he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never know. He listened to the footfalls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliberate and unhurried. The man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">guts. He watched over the swinging doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw the man's head, the black, tall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowned sombrero, and then the old man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside. Harder pushed himself back gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bar, balancing on his heels, his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand hanging loose and relaxed at hi* side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He studied the old man's face, saw the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray hair and the hard-set, but gentle mouth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then let his eyes move slowly downward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed with a start that there was no gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster on the old man's hip. He looked back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the sheriff's eyes and smiled thinly. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps Clayburn was a coward after all. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen men before who wouldn't wear their</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns. It was a way of looking brave without</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever having to prove it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You the man that wants to see me?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Clayburn say, breaking his chain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right, Mr. Clayburn," Jesse said</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did you want?" Mark Clayburn</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. He was standing loosely, his thumbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooked over his belt, his eyes calm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought I said, Mr. Clayburn," Jesse</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied impatiently. "I thought I already</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke my business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clayburn shifted his weight from one foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">to another and watched the younger man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who sent yuh here?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It ain't my right to say," Jesse answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff wrinkled his brow and brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand up to rub slowly across his chin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the softness went out of his eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spoke deliberately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We don't want no trouble here, son. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">been running a peaceful town. We got trou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bles enough. I'm asking you to leave peace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able like and don't cause us no commotion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm telling yuh, old man," Jesse said</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply. "I came here to do a job and I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">until sundown to do it. Next time, you bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter be wearing a gun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suit yourself, son," Clayburn said. There</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was a look of weariness on his face. "Yuh</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, I got a job to do too. I'll be where you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can find me. But if yuh come lookin' for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, don't take any chances."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before Harder could answer, the old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had turned about and was striding out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon. He pushed through the swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors with both hands and turned down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidewalk. Jesse listened to his boots rapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the boards until they faded out in the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance. He turned, found the barkeep still</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing white and motionless by the shot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, and cursed softly to himself. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just his luck to come up against a man with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a gun. Otherwise, it could have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">over by now, the job finished. He disliked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prolonged complications, the waiting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it seemed as though things had been go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that way lately. Perhaps it was because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was getting older, or softer. But you</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't kill a mart who wasn't wearing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun. He had never done that!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went out of the saloon and stopped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sidewalk, looking up and down the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted street. His horse was still standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the rail, head down under the broiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat of the sun. He untied the reins and led</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sorrel across the street to an alley that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran alongside the hotel. The sun had moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">west some now and there was a thin line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow along the unpainted side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found a ring set in the boards, hitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pony again and thought for a moment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">removing the saddle. But there was no tell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing when he might need it. He went back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the street and went down it until he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the window with the sign "Maria's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cafe" painted crudely on it. He paused for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment, looking in the window, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">went inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE restaurant was empty. A narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter and stools ran to the back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building and at the end, near the stove, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman was standing with her back to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When she turned Jesse was surprised. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had expected a Mexican woman, the Maria</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sign outside, but despite this girl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">black hair, her skin was purely white. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">took off his hat, nodded to her and leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the counter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You Maria, Miss?" he said politely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," she said, smiling. She had clean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white teeth--the type he saw infrequently in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the places he had been.</seg><seg type="columnLine">40</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIFTEEN WESTERN TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where can I find her, Miss?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can't," she said, still smiling. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a sign. But I'm the owner. Can I help</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?"	. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hesitated for a minute, watching her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then put his hand in the pocket of his jeans</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pulled out a watch. He put it carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the counter, shrugged his shoulders, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I need a meal," he said. "I want to pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it with this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl picked up the watch, examined it</seg><seg type="columnLine">casually, and put it down again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's a lot of watch for beans and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of steak," she answered. She spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly, with a note of kindness in her voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rang unfamiliarly on Jesse's ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's all I've got," he said, trying to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miss the subject. "And a man don't need a</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch to know when it's day and night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed at that, a low, throaty laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for a moment her eyes met his, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved instantly away. She went down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter toward the stove, leaving the watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying where it was, and while she worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jesse watched her. When she was through,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she put the food in front of him and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the window a few feet away, looking out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you out of a job?" she asked, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice quiet and interested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I reckon you could say I was on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">now," he answered. "But I don't get paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it's done."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you can pick up your watch?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said hopefully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know when I'll be back this</seg><seg type="columnLine">way," he said. He laughed a little to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, humorlessly, because he knew he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never be back. There were many places he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left behind. She seemed to welcome him</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, but by sundown it would be a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had stopped speaking and was looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the street, and despite the near-full-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of his stomach he watched her with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty-bellied feeling. She was tall for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, with long black hair and a rare</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleness about her mouth and eyes. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was younger than he, not yet thirty perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the difference in the ages seemed slight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And she had the body of a woman, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, although her dress revealed nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She turned suddenly, catching him watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her, and although she smiled understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing^ he felt the flush of embarrassment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">along the roots of his hair. It annoyed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little and he forced his mind to think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">something else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know two brothers, Cole and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack Tolman?" he said. He had been sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly uncomfortable and was trying to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation now, but by the abrupt change</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her face, he knew that he hadn't suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded. She looked at him intently, a hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness in her eyes that he hadn't seen there</seg><seg type="columnLine">before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why?" she said sharply. "Are they</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends of yours?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Miss," he said quietly. Despite his</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity about those men, he regretted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had spoken. "I heard tell of them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're gamblers," she said. "They run</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Lucky Spot down the street. Dad's been</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to run them out of town now for two</seg><seg type="columnLine">years."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your dad?" Jesse said, bewildered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," she said. "I'm Mary Clayburn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My father's the sheriff of Beeker's Gulch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was holding the cup of coffee and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">let it down abruptly onto the counter top.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a long moment he watched it, hoping</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she hadn't noticed his startled action.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he glanced up she was looking out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window again and her face had changed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were thin, worried lines under her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he hadn't noticed before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's why I'm afraid," she was saying.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Dad's given them two weeks to pack up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They've sworn they're going to kill him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Talk's cheap, Miss." he said uncomfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't know the Tolmans," she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a tone of bitterness in her voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They'll stop at nothing, not even killing an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sorry. Miss," Jesse said. He wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave now. He had enjoyed the coolness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cafe, and more especially the warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfort of this woman's presence, but all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had changed now. He was sorry he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped here, even though it might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant going hungry until morning. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry he had seen this girl and talked to her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he tried to push the thoughts of it back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't be sorry," she was saying. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldn't bother you with my troubles."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No bother," he said, standing up. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched her for a second, seeing the soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadiness of her eyes and then said, "Good</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay, Miss, and thanks for the meal."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BUSHWHACK BARGAIN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">41</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She relumed Ihe stare and moved up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the counter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here," she said, picking up the watch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her smile broadened. "You'll need this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We're having a dance tonight, down at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old barn near the river. It's at eight o'clock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You'll need this to tell the time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at the watch as though he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never seen it before, and then up into her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes for a moment, hesitating, forgetting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant that he hadn't the choice of yes</seg><seg type="columnLine">or no. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's a right nice invitation, Miss Clay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bum," he said slowly, "but I can't accept."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then take the watch anyway, Mister . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mister?" She looked at him questioningly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks, Miss," he said. He ignored her</seg><seg type="columnLine">request for his name. She would know it</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon enough, he thought. She would hate</seg><seg type="columnLine">him then, and hate herself for having been</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a fool. "1 always pay for what I get,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, and started for the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But come anyway," she said. "It's your</seg><seg type="columnLine">choice." She wasn't urging him now, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">being friendly, warm and friendly in a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had forgotten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped, turned about, and for a fleet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing instant met her smile. "There is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">choice," he said and went out the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OUTSI I)E the sun had left the street and</seg><seg type="columnLine">off to the west, in the foothills, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going down in a red-orange glow in the sky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were a few men on the street now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurrying to their homes or toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon. Old Mark Clayburn should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">around somewhere. He shouldn't be hard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find. Harder hitched at his gun belt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started up the sidewalk, his face tightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and his eyes narrowed a little against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the final brightness of the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he was careless. The job had seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">too easy at first. When he came to the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner of the alley and stepped off the high way</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a thud he saw too late the group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men standing by his horse. His hand made</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instinctive movement toward the holster</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the men had their guns out and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped short, cursing to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the man," he heard someone say.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He recognized the little storekeeper and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion of that afternoon in the saloon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were two or three other men, men</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he didn't know. He tried to back up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">step, but he collided with the walk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let him have it," the storekeeper said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A man next to him raised his Winchester</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Jesse started to leap aside, toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of the building. The shot went wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his boot heel caught on the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk and he crashed into the building and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled back again into the street. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">levered home another shell and Harder got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his knees, his hand jerking at the Colt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he heard the voice yell, "Hold it</seg><seg type="columnLine">men!" He looked up and saw Mark Clay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burn coming up the alley from the rear. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had his gun out, held steadily in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and there was a look of quiet anger in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jesse got to his feet and Clayburn came</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him, then stopped half-way between</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and the group of townsmen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Since when do you coyotes do my fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for me?" he said back over his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This man's a killer, Mark," the store-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper said. "He's Jesse Harder, a hired</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunny."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, and 1 know who hired him," Clay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burn said quietly. "But I'm the law in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">town, not you. This man ain't done nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but talk and it's my job to see that's what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he keeps doing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't count on it, Sheriff," Jesse said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eves fixed on the muzzle of the old man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clayburn noted the direction of Jesse's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, smiled, and slipped the gun into its</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lookee, Mister," he said. "We all know</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. I got a dozen posters on you down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office. You're a tough man. But there</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't no man so tough that he needs killing</seg><seg type="columnLine">as bad as these fellas think you do. For me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe I would a thought different twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago, but times have changed. I'm old</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and I'm peaceable. You're no pup</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself. There'll come a time when killing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man won't be so easy to swallow. It'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick in your craw; it won't go down and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't be able to spit it up.

He kicked it and trotted it out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street, riding stiffly, his eyes set ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">unseeing. When he had gone some distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reined in the pony gently and turned it</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-around. Clayburn was standing where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had left him, his gun still holstered at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. Jesse measured the distance with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. Forty yards. It was an easy shot for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He could drill the old man before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got his gun up. Then, hooked around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck of his horse, he'd be a small target for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the townsmen. There probably wasn't one</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the pack who could shoot him before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got out of range. He needed that hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars bad, as bad as he'd needed anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his life. After all, the man was armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. He had his chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wavered, his right hand motionless on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horn of the saddle, then suddenly reined</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horse about and kicked it into a gallop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the end of town he looked back again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The old mqji was still standing in the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he saw the door of Maria's Cafe open</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw the girl come out. She'd been watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, he thought, and the sharp doubt of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">actions left him. It was with a feeling of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lief that he forded the river and turned to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the spot where the Tolman brothers</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be waiting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS almost dark when he found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand of cottonwood and the old, rotting</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence. He rode along it slowly until he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">make out the dim forms of the three men at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the trees. Not knowing why, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosened the gun in its holster before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung his pony out of the shadow and rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That you, Harder?" he heard Cole Tol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man yell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah," Jesse answered.

The shot whined by Jesse's head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crashed in the cottonwoods behind him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a split instant Jesse had the Colt up. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun exploded alongside the neck of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse, causing the sorrel to jerk over, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jesse saw the Mex double up, gut-shot, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall thudding to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two shots plunked into the hard dirt be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low' him and then another, higher up, whined</seg><seg type="columnLine">off to his left.

The mare had been rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">old and young Clinton had been fully aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day before that the mare did not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">long to go. Still, she was all the horse he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">had and her death left him feeling sad and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was not much that he could do.

The mare would have to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIFTEEN WESTERN TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be left to the natural inclinations of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scavengers. This made young Clinton a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little angry but then, he told himself, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in keeping with the way his luck had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been running lately. Nothing turned out</seg><seg type="columnLine">right for him any more. Nothing would ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn out right for him again. He was posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive of this for he had reached that degree</seg><seg type="columnLine">of despondency where he expected only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was one of those tough years in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cow country. -The bottom had dropped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cattle market. With beef selling for</seg><seg type="columnLine">as little as thirty cents a head, the hide was</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth more than the cow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could always ride the grub line. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not the only one doing that these days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but now his horse was dead and he'd have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drift on foot, unless some rancher made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a gift of an old crow bait. That was how</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had acquired the white mare. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clinton did not want charity. He had pride,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he wanted to earn his way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was nothing to be accomplished</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging around so Clinton lifted his old, bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered McClellan saddle on his shoulder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started walking. He wanted to turn for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">last look of the mare because he had liked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horse, but he forcibly restrained himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He just kept on walking. He could feel the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pebbles through the worn-out soles of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">boots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The saddle became a dead, oppressive</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight. Clinton could not see much of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">point in carrying it. He had no idea how</seg><seg type="columnLine">far he was from the next town or even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next ranch. Perhaps he could sell the saddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">like he had sold all his other possessions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was all that he owned in the world--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clothes on his back and a saddle that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen its best days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, a saddle was the badge of his pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fession. A man was no longer a cowpuncher</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he did not own a saddle. However, Clin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's pockets hung limp and empty. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach twinged now and then from hunger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The saddle would have to be sold--if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could find someone willing to pay him some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing for it. Thinking this left him mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bitter inside. It was at moments like</seg><seg type="columnLine">these that Clinton regretted he had ever sold</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE WAS walking along, wincing every</seg><seg type="columnLine">time a sharp pebble dug into his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">tad trying not to heed the pangs of hunger,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">when he heard the sound of a horse coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">up behind him. Pride would not let Clinton</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to see who it was or allow him to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a stop. He walked on, trying to pretend</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the saddle was feather-light on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder and that he'd been partaking of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-squares-dailv with regularity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rider rode up beside Clinton and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowed his horse down to Clinton's pace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rider said nothing for a while.

"That your mare</seg><seg type="columnLine">back there a piece, son?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clinton stumbled as a particularly sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of rock stabbed up through a break</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his boots.

"I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought you'd like to know I roped your</seg><seg type="columnLine">mare and dragged her to a cutbank and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caved enough down on her to cover her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm much obliged, mister," said Clinton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His throat ached and his eyes stung as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">some grit had got into them. He supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt this way because he hadn't eaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">since yesterday morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see you've still got your saddle," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rider. "Would you be interested in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding job--if I furnished the horse?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Young Clinton came to a halt. He set his</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle down on the ground and lifted suspi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious eyes up to the rider. There was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentment in Clinton. He needed help. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed it badly but he did not want pity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rider had reined in his mount. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sleek and wiry blaze-faced black that</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked cat-quick in its movements. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rider took his glance off the horizon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid it on Clinton. His eyes were black and</seg><seg type="columnLine">opaque and hard. They seemed to hold as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much feeling as two lumps of coal. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rider was tall and gaunt. His face was lined</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seamed with many wrinkles and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin was burned almost black by sun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind. He looked like he had Indian blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">in him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not looking for a hand-out," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clinton with stiff pride.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no emotion on the rider's face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stared at Clinton as if he were looking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fence-post or a rock. "This ain't a hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out," the rider said in his quiet, toneless</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. "I need a man and I'm on my way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">town to hire one and I see you and I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">NEVER SELL YOUR SADDLE!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking I can save myself a ride.

The suspicion</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingered in him that it was pity behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rider's offer but then Clinton took another</seg><seg type="columnLine">look of the face and figured there could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing soft about the man. Nobody with</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes as cold and dead as that could know</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such a thing as pity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the job like?" Clinton asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why don't you come and find out? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can always quit if you don't like it, son."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clinton reckoned he had nothing to lose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After all, he did want a job more than any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else on earth. Maybe this was the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning of the change in his luck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've got yourself a hand, mister,'' he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, trying to keep the jubilance out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rider told Clinton to climb up behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on the black and Clinton did. He braced</seg><seg type="columnLine">his old McClellan kak against a thigh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they started off, riding double. The rider</seg><seg type="columnLine">smelled of horse-sweat and woodsmoke which</seg><seg type="columnLine">to young Clinton were the sweetest odors</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the world. Looking down, he saw the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gun in the man's holster. The weapon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a .44 Colt with a long seven-and-a-half inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrel. The handle was black and worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">very smooth as if it had seen much use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After they had ridden about a mile, Clin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton said, "I'm Ernie Clinton, mister."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm called Valverde," said the rider.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that, they had nothing to talk about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The only sounds that rose were those of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black's hoofs on the trail . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Valverde's place lay at the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">badlands. It did not look like much of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">outfit. Valverde's brand was double V and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Clinton, the few cows he saw wearing this</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron were sleek and fat despite the sparse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the graze. But this, he figured, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably because Valverde did pot have too</seg><seg type="columnLine">many head and so, what little graze there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sufficed to put weight on the animals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This set Clinton to thinking. If Valverde's</seg><seg type="columnLine">place was rundown and he did not have too</seg><seg type="columnLine">many cows, what did he want a rider for?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valverde had just felt sorry for him, Clinton</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, and it made him angry to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was getting charity again.

Something of a dandy, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-peaked stetson was cream-colored and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was wearing a flashy red plaid shirt under</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brown and white calfskin vest.

Besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we don't need no help."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time, a bit of emotion showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Valverde's face. The line of his jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightened and his voice came quietly but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a deadliness to it that was like a knife-</seg><seg type="columnLine">point jabbing against a rib.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm rodding this outfit, Duke.

They were gone al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most every night, returning at dawn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping most of the day. It was in the eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nings before he rode off that Valverde gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clinton his instructions for the next day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The job seemed genuine enough to young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clinton. The ranch apparently had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">neglected for some time and he never idled</seg><seg type="columnLine">for lack of something to do. He repaired the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheds and the corrals. He kept an eye on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stock. The place really needed a hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Valverde and Bedford seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no time for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, Ernie Clinton could see no point to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. The times were bad and beef on the hoof</seg><seg type="columnLine">was practically worthless. It certainly did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not pay any one to keep a hand on at an</seg><seg type="columnLine">outfit like the double V. Wages had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">NEVER SELL YOUR SADDLE!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">47</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">been mentioned when Clinton had been hired</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he did not expect any. He was perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied with his three-squares a day, this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the knowledge that the job had probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevented him from doing something wrong.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had been on the verge of going bad the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day Valverde had picked him up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON THIS evening, Valverde came over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clinton and said, "You could stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">some new clothes, son. Here's an advance</seg><seg type="columnLine">on your wages. Run into town in the morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and get yourself a new outfit. You've</seg><seg type="columnLine">earned a day off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Young Clinton thought of the holes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his boots and of the patches he had sewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to keep his clothes together and he flushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little. He could feel Valverde's eyes on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. They were keen and piercing as if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were looking right into the maw of his heart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he spoke, Valverde's voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely gentle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "A man needn't be ashamed of being poor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's bad only when a man has to be ashamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of how he got rich. Remember that, son."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke Bedford came out of the house and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and Valverde mounted their horses. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode off together. Ernie Clinton watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">them go. He knew it was none of his busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness but he wished Valverde wouldn't do so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much night-riding. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The new clothes and new boots made</seg><seg type="columnLine">young Clinton feel right good. He could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite put it into words as he tried explain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it to himself. All he knrw was that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new outfit had boosted his feeling of self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect, not so much because it was new but</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he had earned it rather than having</seg><seg type="columnLine">' received it as a gift.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On the way back to the double V, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtaken by two riders. They told Clinton</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pull up and then they arrayed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounts side by side in front of Clinton. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the riders was a short, beefy man with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">red face and a tawnv mustache. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">rider was tall and slat-thin with a gaunt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollow-cheeked face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The red-faced one said, "My name's Fred</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aderhold. That there is Bruce Partridge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We're Valverde's neighbors."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clinton nodded in acknowledgment. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">said nothing. His heart was pounding a lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle, as if in anticipation of something un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You been working for Valverde a month</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, ain't you?" said Aderhold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clinton nodded again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aderhold's eyes swept Clinton's brand new</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes. "Doing all right, I see," Aderhold</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Resentment and anger flared in young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clinton. "I bought these clothes out of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">wages. Anything wrong with that?*'</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No-o," drawled Aderhold, with exag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerated indifference. "Only, we can't see</seg><seg type="columnLine">how an outfit the size of the double V can</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay the way of three men in times like</seg><seg type="columnLine">these."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't see where it's any of your busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness," snapped Clinton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll show you where it's our business,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Aderhold, the color of his face deepen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, the timbre of his voice thickening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We're warning you this time only, kid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe you don't know it but Valverde and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke Bedford and some others have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">running off our stock to some secret place in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the badlands. There they butcher the cows</seg><seg type="columnLine">and skin them and dry the hides. The hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">right now is worth more than the cow but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't last like that. When the day comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that beef prices go up again, we want to cash</seg><seg type="columnLine">in on that to make up for these poor times.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We won't be able to cash in if we don't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">any stock. You understand, kid?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I never stole another man's beef in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">my life," young Clinton said indignantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not asking you to own up to it,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Aderhold, his tone flat and uncompro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mising. "I'm just telling you that if you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">smart, kid you'll get out of the country.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We're going to find that trail into the bad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands one of these days and when we do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's going to be a bunch of hombres kick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out their lives at the ends of ropes. . . ."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke Bedford rode in alone one morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was driving a couple of calves and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">herded them into a corral.

He unsaddled and turned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired buckskin into a corral.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where's Valverde?" asked Clinton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Val's away on business," said Bedford.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He'll be back in three-four days." He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyeing Clinton's new clothes. "You buy</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself a gun?" he asked casually.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are things I need worse than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun," said Clinton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">48</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIFTEEN WESTERN TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't think so," said Bedford.

He wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valverde to be honest and respectable but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clinton realized sadly that there was noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing he could do about it. He could leave,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was about all; but he owed something</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Valverde. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN Valverde returned, four days la-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, he looked angry. There was a hard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright glint in his black eyes and his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pinched tightly. A muscle kept twitch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the base of Valverde's jaw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duke Bedford had done no night-riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Valverde was gone. Clinton had begun</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hope that that part of it was over for good.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wished for that, even if it meant that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would no longer be needed then at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">double V.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Valverde planted his boots firmly on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, his legs spread a little. His thumb</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hooked in his cartridge belt. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke, he looked neither at Clinton nor at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bedford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I've come across a couple of our calves</seg><seg type="columnLine">following two of Fred Aderhold's Rafter A</seg><seg type="columnLine">cows.

"I did," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why?" said Valverde.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was sadness in Ernie Clinton. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see how it stood. There was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble for him here now and it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">best if he left, but he hated the thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">going away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I thought they were ours," he said sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Valverde's eyes moved now and fell on</seg><seg type="columnLine">young Clinton. Valverde was squinting so</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard his lids almost touched. His glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">was practically a palpable thing on Clinton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Couldn't you read the brand on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mammies?" asked Valverde.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Their mammies weren't around," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clinton. He wanted to explain the all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it but there was a strange reluctance hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him back. He had been tricked by Duke</seg><seg type="columnLine">. Bedford but he was not going to cry about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Valverde's stare switched to Bedford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why did you do it, Duke?" Valverde asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He must have known his partner very well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clinton thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bedford made no effort to deny it. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">about time the kid started earning his keep,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Bedford. "I thought I'd break him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this way. " A cunning smile curved the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ners of his moiith. "He's no longer clean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Val. He can get sent to the pen for what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did. So he might as well start giving us a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand in the badlands." Bedford spat. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick and tired of the dirty, stinking work</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he's here living on hand-outs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told you to leave him alone, Duke,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Valverde. "This finishes us. First,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, I owe you something. I'm leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the choice up to you, Duke. Either pull your</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun or drop your shell belt. Which is it go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to be?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bedford's mouth twitched, baring his teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a grimace of rage and hate. His hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to move toward his gun but then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the gelid, uncompromising glint in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valverde's eyes and paled a little. The snarl</seg><seg type="columnLine">left his mouth. Then with a display of bra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vado, it came back, wavered a little, dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared. He reached for the buckle of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost simultaneously the two heavy belts</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit the ground. Valverde turned a little drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping his and, in that instant, Bedford</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed. He loosed a wild swing that caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valverde on the side of the head and sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">him sprawling. Bedford leaped in, boots</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking Valverde's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Valverde swore with hurt and fury. Grab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing one of Bedford's kicking legs, he pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and twisted. Bedford cried out as he lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">his balance and went crashing to the earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he was up instantly to meet Valverde's</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bedford started another prodigious swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Valverde ducked under it and with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head still down butted the dandy in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach. The breath whooshed out of Bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford; his face turned green. Before he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">recover, Valverde was raining blows at him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fists cracking with sounds as sharp as</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunshots. At first, Bedford tried to retaliate</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he could not stand up to Valverde's in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensate fury. He worked on Bedford's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a single-minded savagery. The flesh be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to split and the blood dripped from Bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford's features to his clothes, spattering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">close working Valverde.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bedford was grunting with pain and fu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">NEVER SELL YOUR SADDLE!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tility. He no longer tried to hit back. Rais-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his arms, he sought to bury his face in</seg><seg type="columnLine">them for protection but Valverde smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them aside and hit Bedford flush on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fell back, moaning with hurt. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valverde smashed him again. Now Bedford's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was just raw, bleeding flesh. Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Valverde's blows struck him and he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawling. He was not unconscious but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay where he had fallen, face buried against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth. Duke Bedford had quit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Valverde stood there, breathing hard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat dripping off his chin. The mask had</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped from his emotions and now his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a contorted grimace of pure and utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't ever let me lay eyes on you again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke," said Valverde, "because if I do, I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">killing you! . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HPHE sad and bitter part of it for Clinton</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that Valverde still rode at night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clinton was tempted several times to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valverde of the warning that had been de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">livered by Fred Aderhokl, but then Clinton</seg><seg type="columnLine">figured that Valverde knew what it was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, and he was just simply taking a cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culated risk. Besides, Clinton thought, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was none of his business. Valverde had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">once offered an explanation of his where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abouts after dark and so Clinton let the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter lie. But he felt ill at ease and ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehensive about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This night Ernie Clinton awoke with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of a running horse beating in his earS.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sat upright in his bunk, his heart starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pound hard, ears straining as he listened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the thrum of the hoofs drawing nearer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There seemed to be a sense of urgency and</seg><seg type="columnLine">merciless haste in the pounding run of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse and a thousand wild, frantic fears</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed through Clinton's mind. Then he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of bed and pulling on his trousers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his boots. The horse came to a halt now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was only the sound of its labored</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing just outside the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clinton opened the portal and looked out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A full moon was riding high and Clinton in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly discerned the slumped figure on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Valverde!" Clinton cried. The sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangled in his throat. "Valverde!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man's head lifted as Clinton reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He was trying to struggle to his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Clinton reaching down, grabbed him un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">der the armpits, and experienced the sicken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing feel of blood-soaked cloth under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Valverde could not help himself to any</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent. Clinton dragged the man inside and</seg><seg type="columnLine">boosted him up on his bunk. Then Clinton</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted the lantern. In its feeble light, Val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verde's face looked drawn and gray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CLINTON stood there, staring down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valverde. Some of the smoke from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern must have got into his eyes for they</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to sting. Valverde lay quietly, eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed, his chest rising and falling. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood from the wound in his back was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready soaking the blankets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What happened, Valverde?" asked Clin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A spasm ripped a small moan out of Val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verde's clenched teeth. Then he seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">relax. "That damn Bedford," he muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Was it Duke who shot you?" asked Clin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Duke's skipped the country," said Val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verde, eyes still closed, "but before he left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sold us out. Aderhold and Partridge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't know how many others were there</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for us. They strung five of us up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">son.

He could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winking of the gunflames and the sounds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shots were faint and crisp. After a while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shooting stopped. There was only silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">now.

Barney slid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet paper off the bar and stuffed it under</seg><seg type="columnLine">his apron, into his levi pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another gambler, a whiskey peddler who</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his pile sneaking in sugared alcohol</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Indians, swore and pounded the bar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lost my damned dirty shirt ag'n!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney stared at the big roll of bills</seg><seg type="columnLine">another gambler was counting off casually.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His fingers twitched on the bar rag, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">licked his lips. The gambler who always</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost sneered at Barney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You got a real good racket, you have,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney. Can't recall Brackson or Begbie</seg><seg type="columnLine">here ever hiring a dude tinhorn for a bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumper 'afore. Don't even carry a gun, do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you? A fine racket. Big tips every night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the free rotgut you want, maybe filchin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the till here an' then. What a setup, Barney.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You know, I think I'll get me a nice little</seg><seg type="columnLine">wifie, an' spread the word around that she's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fainty-sick near to dyin'; then, maybe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brackson'll take me in, an' set me up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a soft job. If--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brackson's usually kind face went hard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his blue eyes iced over. His right hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed across the 'air, the heavy diamond</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring glinting. The gambler who always lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">swore and stumbled back, a red gash ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearing across his forehead, blood running</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brackson rubbed his ring thoughtfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You been riding the kid too much," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Go out an' peddle your alcohol, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay out a' here. The kid's all right, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're not. Now, keep yore claw away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">thet hoglaig--and git!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Anson didn't move. Instead, he bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a half crouch, snarling, his hand hooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the walnut butt of his six-shooter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney's throat was dry as his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched the bar. Then he saw Begbie and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other gamblers step back out of range</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Brackson flipped back his coat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped his hand to a double-barreled der-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringer in a shoulder holster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An expectant quiet filtered down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of the long room and slid up the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">painted stairs above the piano. The little</seg><seg type="columnLine">fat man who had been playing the same jig</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune over and over, stopped and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">around. Tables and chairs in the mud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored sawdust of the 'floor scraped back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Men backed away from the bar. The busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">roulette wheels and dice tables in the far</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner went momentarily out of business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney felt sick in the stomach. In his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nostrils, the smell was thick and rancid and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot, the small of Dodge, the smell of death</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stale beer and bad whiskey. A drunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman with faded blond hair looked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a table and laughed tonelessly, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped her head back down in her arms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">overturning a bottle of whiskey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney had seen it too many times to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">bothered much, except that now he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Seth Brackson going down with a bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in him, and it made him cold inside. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought about how now» if he had any guts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might step in and repay Brackson for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd done for him. A .45 was under the bar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Barney just stood there, frozen, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands gripping the bar edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Anson said. "Your crooked house-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys have high-staked me to hell fer the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last time, Brackson. You've taken me fer</seg><seg type="columnLine">every cent I ever hauled in here. You run a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked game here, Brackson, an' I'm callin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">your dirty hand!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney took a sharp breath. Everyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew Brackson and Begbie's honesty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everyone knew what happened when Brack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son was accused of the contrary. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">honest and square, and handled his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrapes, though there had been very few</seg><seg type="columnLine">run-ins between' him and Dodge. He wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gunman, and he wasn't the type of man</seg><seg type="columnLine">to draw the fire of others. Just a fair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">honest man seldom crossed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now the showdown had come. Anson</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lightning fast on the draw. And Brack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son was short on practice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BARNEY'S hand crept down beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar. The .45 kept there by one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other bar-jumpers touched his wet fingers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">56</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIFTEEN WESTERN TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">His hand jumped away from it like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal was red hot. He blinked sweat out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his eyes, and felt his lips stretch into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thin sour line. Brackson was right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brackson had staked a yellow-bellied coyote,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and could expect nothing in return from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney Stevens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard Begbie say calmly. "Don't play</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him, Seth. I've hired a man." Begbie's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice rose. "All right, Blacky!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney moved his eyes, and the sickness</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his stomach curdled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A big raw-boned man was walking across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sawdust from the stairs. A big man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gray vest, wearing a grey stetson, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">black mustache, and two low-thonged .45's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney remembered; he could never forget.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blacky Jethro!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everyone followed the big rangy gunman</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he walked up and stood a little to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of Brackson. Brackson's eyes narrowed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I handle my own plays, Jethro. Get him</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of here, Begbie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Begbie said. "Don't be a damned fool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blacky Jethro moved in front of Brackson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He moved with a powerful rangy ease, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes shone with a black, bright eager-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said in a soft drawl. "Holster up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rabbit out a' here, Anson. An' don't come</seg><seg type="columnLine">back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You ain't talkin' to me," Anson said. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiped the blood out of his eyes with his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, but his right still hung overjiis gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">butt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm savin' it to you, Anson, but only once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. Flag out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anson ran his tongue over his lower lip,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for an instant his eyes looked longing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly at the batwings. Then he spoke and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice was low and tight. "You put me out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' then I reckon I'll stay."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Few saw Blacky's draw. When the lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught Anson in the shoulder, he was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliding his gun free. Then his hand froze,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he groaned as a sudden blood stain</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread on his buckskins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Blacky wasn't finished. His right</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist smashed into Anson's jaw, and his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist made a sickening slap in' Anson's belly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he kicked Anson's leg, and the peddler</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawled out in the sawdust, and lay there</seg><seg type="columnLine">coughing and grunting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a while, Blacky dragged him to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and started him toward the half-doors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He threw him outside into the street, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then returned and leaned against the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">just inside the doors.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment, Barney couldn't take his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes from Blacky. He licked his lips and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubbed his hands together but couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn away. Then Begbie said. "We need a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man like that here, Seth. There's too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">money here and we got to take care of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. I should have asked you, but you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how it is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brackson buttoned his coat. "All right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Begbie." He glanced at Barney, his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressionless. "Reckon we do need a gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shark. But keep him out of the card-rooms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keep him here on the floor an' no place</seg><seg type="columnLine">else."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking at Brackson, Barney wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether he imagined disgust in Brackson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and in his voice, but dropped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought as Brackson said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can go see your wife now, Barney.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bifback at five this afternoon. Got a lot a'</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleanin' to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney went out the back door when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">left. Blacky Jethro was still standing by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main half-doors up front. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney was free now. He hurried along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boardwalk of Dodge, down the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">block that took him every morning at dawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to that stuffy little room where Clara</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. He walked fast past the line of un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">painted, leaning, clapboard shells facing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad. on Front Street and cursed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town as a blight, a blot, a lumped scar</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the belly of Kansas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he thought of the money, pouring</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Brackson's saloons in glittering</seg><seg type="columnLine">floods, and how, if he had even a small share</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it, he could take Clara and go back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pennsylvania in style, and in a wav that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one back there could laugh at.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was plenty of money in Dodge. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had watched it make the big gambling tables</seg><seg type="columnLine">groan, watched the dregs of the plains from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canada to Mexico, the buffalo hunters and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiskey peddlers, Eastern toiyists and Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lish lords and Russian grand dukes, all with</seg><seg type="columnLine">big fat rolls of bills. And all Barney got</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a measly weekly pay check, and a tip</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and then, tossed unseeingly at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">like bones to a dog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had to have his share, had to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clara out of here. He climbed the dusty</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs through the dim light, and hesitated</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the warped cracked door to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">DRAW FAST--OR DIE!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">room in the Tarryington Hotel thinking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman who could only lie in the half</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness of a hot lonely room, and listen</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the guns flared and funeral processions</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed on to Boot Hill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He stepped in and softly closed the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the white' bed, the moon shone through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window. She stirred, and he saw that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was awake. She was always awake, waiting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he came home at dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dropped to his knees beside the bed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her hands were like a child's, damp and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold. They seemed transparent to Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he held them. She was beautiful, Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, even now. The moon made a golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">shine on her hair. Her eyes were sunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">in dark shadows, and her voice seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drift to Barney from a long way off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've been worried about you, Barney."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney buried his head in the damp</seg><seg type="columnLine">coverlet. Her hand brushed the back of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck, softly, gently. Every time her hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">caressed him like this, it seemed it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I heard a lot of shooting, Barney. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought they might have--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a sob in his voice. "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry about me, Clara.

You always had money. That little</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece a' land of my dad's wouldn't ever have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done anything for us. How did I know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">law an' order went out of this country when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Texas drovers came in?

He got to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet -and slid back until he dropped into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chair. He stared at the dawn bursting over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER TWO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney Calls a Bluff</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LATE that evening, Barney went back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his nightly grind. His face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">haggard, twisted with his thoughts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All he could think of were those thick yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolls of bills in the gamblers' hands. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">night long he had slept fitfully in a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow rain, a rain of hundred and thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollar bills. If he got the money and got</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clara out of here, she would forget that</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening when he'd run from the Texans, lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">slugs whining at his bare heels, his face white</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his brain glazed with terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maybe even he would forget that too;</seg><seg type="columnLine">even forget how he had stood frozen, par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alyzed, while Anson prepared to kill Seth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brackson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He avoided looking _at Blacky Jethro as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he mopped up behind the bar. He wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">if Blacky remembered him. He never gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">any sign of recognizing him, but then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blacky's face never showed anything. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressionless, a kind of bronzed dead mask.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was pretty quiet in the saloon, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet late enough for the evening rush. Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">eased around the end of the bar and slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">.up the stairs. He stood in the half-darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the upper hallway. He'd been here once</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the night he'd lost all their stake in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an all-night session of black-jack. The hall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way was studded with fourteen closed doors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These doors led into the card rooms. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the passageway was an open</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway where an oil light still burned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly yellow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He'd see Brackson. Maybe he'd apologize</seg><seg type="columnLine">for turning yellow that morning. Brackson</seg><seg type="columnLine">had known there was a .45 at Barney's</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger-tips. But what the hell!--there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing he could say to Brackson. A door</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his right was partly open, and voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">filtered through, the sound of glass and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smell of thick smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A poker session, still going, Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. His mind spun dizzily. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what kind of a game that would be. Hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of thousands of dollars piled on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">table like leaves on an Eastern road at fall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Stumbling a little, Barney went on down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passageway and looked inside Brack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's office. Next 'o it was Begbie's office,</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed and locked" and silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There, behind a flat desk, Brackson sat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">58</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIFTEEN WESTERN TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">His chin was slumped on his chest, his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat on the table top. The ashes of a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar were like gray dust on the front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his checkered vest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Brackson," he whispered hoarsely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Seth--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brackson didn't move. The oil flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickered in the lamp.

It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Begbie. He stood, tall and expressionless in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorway, his thumbs hooked in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">jeweled belt, his bowler hat on the back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head. "Maybe he's asleep, Barney. May-</seg><seg type="columnLine">be he don't want to be disturbed.

He went past</seg><seg type="columnLine">Begbie, and back downstairs, and went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work behind the bar. As the time passed, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of Brackson, of that opened safe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Brackson sleeping with his chin buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">in dead cigar ash. Self disgust and fear was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big lump in Barney's stomach, growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">bigger and thicker. He'd gone up there</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for money, he knew that now. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Begbie appeared at the bar, chopping off</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney's thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gambler leaned across the bar, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale face tight and his eyes too bright.

He saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray vest and gray stetson of Blacky Jethro</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing by the half-doors.

"Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, Barney--" He held out a button,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then let it fall and spin on the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar. It was a button from Barney's shirt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I found it by Seth's desk, Barney."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney's mouth was sticky, the words</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't come out very well. "It was hangin'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> loose, Begbie. I musta' lost it up there</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I was up there to see Seth.

May-</seg><seg type="columnLine">be your voice was the last he ever heard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What did you say, Barney--'thanks, Seth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanks for that big dumb heart.' Is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you said, Barney?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Begbie began eating slowly from the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheese and cracker supply on the bar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wouldn't do any harm to Seth Brack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son," Barney said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No one will, now," Begbie said. "He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great man, but not for this business. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusted people. I already sent word to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheriff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Begbie turned and hooked his elbows on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bar. Thevsaloon had quieted as a stocky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard looking man came through the bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings and without looking at anyone, went</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the unpainted stairs, with two deputies</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Begbie said. ''Bat Masterson's mighty fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a gun, but I've seen sheriffs with more</seg><seg type="columnLine">brains. I'm goin' up and tell him some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. Barney. Wanta' come along?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wha--what you gonna tell him?" Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't know, not for sure, not right yet,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Begbie said. "Whoever murdered Seth got</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mighty big haul out of the safe. What I</seg><seg type="columnLine">say depends on what he does with the bills.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guess there must have been a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand in tapped currency sheafs in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe, Barney. But it ain't there now. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back in an' I stood there an' talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Seth for ten minutes before 1 found</seg><seg type="columnLine">out for sure why he didn't answer. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of you, Barney, and how much you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to go back to Pennsylvania in style.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Think Bat Masterson might be interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Begbie turned and Barney followed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the stairs. The piano had stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and men watched them, the whisper running</seg><seg type="columnLine">from mouth to mouth that Seth Brackson</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been murdered; the safe robbed. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney found that .45 in his hand, found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself shoving it under the waist band</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his levis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Begbie hadn't directly accused him of'</seg><seg type="columnLine">killing Brackson. Merely suggested. Murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the money; just suggestion. That's all</seg><seg type="columnLine">it took in Dodge City. A peculiar sensation</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred in Barney as his legs moved mechani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally up the stairs. A terrilf; feeling that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">DRAW FAST--OR DIE!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">59</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was trapped ... and alone . . . forever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With Seth Brackson dead and gone, Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney realized how much strength the quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man had given him, how much Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">had depended on Brackson. And he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered what Brackson had said once to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him:.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're something like my son was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, Barney. He looked a lot like you. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very young, like you, and he hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned yet to be tough. He never got a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to learn. A Sherman man shot him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down by Kennesaw Mountain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maybe he thought Barney'd grow into</seg><seg type="columnLine">something, like he knew his son would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he hadn't been shot down at Kennesaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mountain. Barney's breath choked in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat. He was almost glad Brackson had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been dead, because now Brackson would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never know that Barney had come seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">up here earlier to try to steal a sheaf or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dirty yellow bills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney stopped, and Begbie went on down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passageway toward Brackson's office,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Bat Masterson and his deputies were</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking around. Who had murdered Brack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. Who could have--?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> •It didn't matter, because they'd stick him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it. Maybe they would; maybe they</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't. But anyway, Brackson was dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hadn't deserved to die. Barney couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">face him now, even dead. He slipped out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passageway into an empty card room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS DARK. He stumbled through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark toward an open window. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty foot drop or so to the ground. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">run for it, tell Clara--what would he tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clara? No--he'd go on anywhere, fade out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe that would be good for Clara. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she'd know for sure what he was. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tipped over a box by the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started to climb out the window, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands brushed against the canvas sack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied up fast and hard. He knew what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it, he knew where it came from. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched down, his eyes growing accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the light. Hifr fingers fumbled at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy cord, and then he spilled the thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheafs of tapped currency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Minutes marched past through the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the room as Barney crouched there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sheaf of yellow thousand dollar bills in</seg><seg type="columnLine">each hand. The killer had cached it here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">temporarily, hidden it in that box, waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make a getaway. Someone in the saloon,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> one of the gamblers who knew they wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be using this room for a spell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stuffed the money back in the sack</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started to tie it up. The door opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. A ray of light fell on Barney's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, on the sack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In silhouette, he saw a tall thin outline,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then the door closed and Begbie was</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing over him. His jeweled belt glit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, as did the pearl handle of his .41</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colt in its studded holster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney half rose, on one foot and knee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still clutching the sack. He had the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. All he'd ever need. He could still try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get Begbie, and if he did, he could run</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the money. With Clara, he could get</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of town tonight. They'd never suspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney, not for a while.' Maybe he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">get free, live free, give Clara all the gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">of heaven--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Begbie said. "They're taking his body out</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, Barney, carrying it on a door. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't say anything to Masterson. I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know--but now--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't kill him," Barney said. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't. I was scared and stepped in here</seg><seg type="columnLine">because I thought you were going to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sheriff I'd killed him. I was going to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to get away. I found the money and--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Begbie's laughter came down softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the dark. "You can't even lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong, Barney. You sound guilty, guiltier</seg><seg type="columnLine">than hell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney dropped the sack. He stood up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't try to jump me, Barney." Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the pearl-handled gun slide free, heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oi'y click of the hammer going back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a minute, Begbie. I'm tellin' the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth. You got to believe I'm tellin' the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth. Whoever killed him brought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money here to hide it until he could get</seg><seg type="columnLine">it out of the saloon. Whoever did it will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to get the money, tonight, right soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably. We'll wait here, Begbie. We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait together and he'll show up. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll know. If I'm lyin', no one will come."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Begbie was silent for a while. Finally he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "All right, Barney. A skunk deserves</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fightin' chance. We'll wait a while. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">not too long. Masterson is the prowling</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They waited for what seemed several</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred years. Begbie had moved back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a corner, and gradually Barney could dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinguish the highlights of his face, the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">shiny bone structure and the hollows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">60</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIFTEEN WESTERN TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows between. His breath was long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even. Always calm, always smooth, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Begbie, the man from the East, the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Chicago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney leaned back against the wall by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window, and after awhile he realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right hand was gripping the butt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big .45 he'd thrust into the waistband</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his levis. The gun felt clammy and cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his palm. He felt his fingers curl</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly until he was gripping the butt tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stared at the closed door; he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">take his eyes off of it. The sounds of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon below seemed to fade. The sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the roaring hell of Front Street, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">faded too. Nothing existed anymore but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that door, and a few scattered memories,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the things a man always wants to remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he dies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The things Clara had said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Barney . . .

I know I'll never have to worry</seg><seg type="columnLine">as long as I'm with you. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney's lips moved in the dark.

Twenty thousand on the barrel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney's lips stretched painfully. Sweat</seg><seg type="columnLine">trickled down his ribs. Again and again he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to swallow to open up his throat. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">he finally released his grip on the Colt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">handle, and found his fingers paralyzed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">numb. He was flexing that hand when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door opened abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The broad stetson, the broad shoulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tall, rawboned frame.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew in a deep silent breath, sweet rare</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath when it's a man's last. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of all the things he'd wanted to do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big plains farm he was going to build,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waving oceans of wheat that were to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">his . . . the kids, wild free sun-blackened</seg><seg type="columnLine">kids, they would have been his too. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought of Clara made a throbbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrant ache in his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waited for that sick, empty fear, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless vomity fear. And it didn't come.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no feeling at all. Just a gray vest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a gray stetson coming toward him</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the last twilight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard his voice say.

Now the sound and the flame stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He staggered back and leaned against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall.

The spokes dried</seg><seg type="columnLine">'out and rattled and the wheels shrunk until</seg><seg type="columnLine">their iron tires suddenly clattered off.

He was big, this man in buckskins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and little things didn't often faze him. Near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing forty years of age, and at the height of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his physical powers, a score of trails had</seg><seg type="columnLine">burnt his body into tight ropes of muscle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hardened his mind to many things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew what (hey were saying, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't care. They were saying that maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd run twenty trains into Santa Fe but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'd passed the Santa Fe Trail a long time</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. They might even h® helling that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know the way In Oeaon any better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than they did. It didn't •'-•itter. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own bullwhackers were loyal and that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the important thing, even though the new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comers had twenty-five wagons against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten and stood as a sreenhorn majority</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his seasoned trail men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once he had dared them. ' All right, go off</seg><seg type="columnLine">North to the regular trail if you want," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had said. "We're through the Pawnee coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try now and they say there's no bad Injuns</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead. But remember, I'm takin' this trail."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That had riled them. He knew well enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they said, that they couldn't go it alone. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clear to them that he was trying to trick</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Any fool knew that there were hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible Injuns everywhere. So they'd mumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grumbled through a meeting in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joel Kalder, the lawyer, had delivered a fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side speech against Shawn and splitting up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the party and that had been all. Except that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kalder had somehow established himself as</seg><seg type="columnLine">spokesman for the immigrants. But even</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was negligible, for, by hook and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">crook, and by cursing and cajoling, Bill got</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to the mountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had double-hitched to the first bench.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There, the trail seemed to go straight up</seg><seg type="columnLine">so Bill Shawn hitched five teams to a wagon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dragged it to the second bench. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, a bluff rose two hundred feet to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top, where an easy trail led off into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plateau beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first wagon up was one of Bill's own.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tied the great rope himself to the dou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble trees, then carried it up to the pulley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been anchored to a rock outcrop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping by a logg'ng chain that he meant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sell in Oregon. He reeved it through and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment glanced down the hillside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Below, by the wagon, was the surly gang</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was to heave on the rope and below</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, a ten-horse hitch was dragging the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">next wagon up to the bench. Further down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rising yellow dust murked where the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the train straggled upwards. Bill Shawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled to himself, "Damn greenhorns!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he jerked the rope through and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowered down the trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a while, he jumped down off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock with the rope in his big, red-haired</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, and lunged down the hill as the rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrilled through the pulley. He was down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others when the rope hauled him up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a jerk, and a cloud of dust burst up around</seg><seg type="columnLine">his boots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man called out of the crowd, "You no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tice that rain cloud, Shawn?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TTE HAD noticed it, and now he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up again. It was gun-metal gray and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging right over them. He glanced at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaker. It. was Joel Kalder, the lawyer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His long face was cut by a thin smile. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pleased by that cloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If that cloud breaks," Kalder said, ''It</seg><seg type="columnLine">will turp this hillside into a river."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shawn swore. "Then dammit, we'll tloat</seg><seg type="columnLine">the v^igons uphill!" Roughly, he turned on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his crew. "Now git onto that rope and take</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strain. But don't you forget a minute that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you slip, this wagon's goin' to go down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill like a gunshot out of particular hell and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow a hole right through those folks cornin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">up! Now strain, damn you, strain!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grumbling, they seized the rope and ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged themselves along it so each man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">space to grip in. It took a long time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill watched, his hands on his hips until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'd finished. Then he roared, "You polers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When we take a strain, yank those poles out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wheels and go up alongside, ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pole in, when we get on top. Now, ever'-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body! Pull solid! Don't jerk consarn ye!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pu-ull!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pu-u-11!" he bellowed, and steadily threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own weight against the rope. "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerk, pu-u-II!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chain up above them grated into</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock.. The pulley screamed shrilly as steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">honed against steel. Poles clattered out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the freed wheels and men grunted, heaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the spokes. The merest movement raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">choking clouds of dust that hid the peaks in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distance and narrowed vision down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yellowed wheel spokes on which the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung their weight, or the coarse rope burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at their hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shawn's own fists were fastened on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">70</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIFTEEN WESTERN TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rope like twisted roots of some giant tree.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt the great backward surge of power</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving out of his unflexing legs. The wagon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was inching forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dust steadily thickened as thirty pairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of boots stabbed at the slope, but the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">coutinued driving their weight back down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill, dragging the wagon with painful slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness up toward the pulley and the rock. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun burned down hot on their backs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat was stinging in their eyes, but, still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one faltered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pulling men were down behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon now. It hadn't more than twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet to go and the polers were yelling excit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly and preparing to jam the pole through.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They used oak timbers from a wagon that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fallen off a ridge and smashed up for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shawn did not trust green poles to hold the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels. Up at the lead, he struggled, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they worked like demons to keep pace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Git on it, you boys," Shawn bellowed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Git back there away from Oregon, back</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from Oregon, so the wagijns can go</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead!" His muscles bunched powerful, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">his legs held firm and he chanted in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhythm of his work, "Git away from Ore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gon, Oregon!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They took up his chant until suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spell was broken by frightened yells be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind. In an instant, Bill Shawn felt the rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hands come alive and jerk away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He felt the rope dance and heard rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">clattering, and saw the yellow dust thicken</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him as men below rolled it up. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody yelled, "They ain't holdin' ahind!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dust, whirled up from behind, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a great swath of it rolled down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope. It was all a yellow nightmare, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill Shawn's iron grip on the rope was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure as a man's hold on a fistful of water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rope tail whipped his back in passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ripping through His hands, was greased</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his own blood. Then the pulley shrieked</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the hurtling wagon crashed down past</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shawn and into the yellow cloud of dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">from out of which men were fleeing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fraptic haste.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shawn watched a poler jam his wagon</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue into a wheel on the far side, and held</seg><seg type="columnLine">his breath so it caught. But then the tip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pole rammed the wagon bed, the pole</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashing out at the struggling poler with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred times his own strength. It caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knee and threw him as if he were a mouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung by a catapult. He went screaming off</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">into the dust that hid him from Bill's view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jump clear, jump clear!" Shawn heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself yelling, but he knew it was too late.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only those who had jumped by instinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get out of the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He watched open mouthed while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon careened down the slope, visible as</seg><seg type="columnLine">only an occasional spinning wheel jutted out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the booming dust down toward the ant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like forms crawling up from below. lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't want to imagine what would happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">if that spinning hell reached the women and</seg><seg type="columnLine">children. He just stood and watched and</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayed. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond the dust cloud loomed a giant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind-twisted pine. The wagon took a sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den swerve and smashed against it and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree shook like a twanged bowstring as</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels and wagon timbers seemed to spurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every direction. Then, slowly, the pine</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree bent, then wavered for a moment, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed to earth. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A damp wind came along and eased the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust away, to show the shattered wagon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree lying in a crumpled heap far down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Your fault, Shawn! What a damn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hairbrained idea! Why, dragging wagons</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a sheer cliff, could have killed us all!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill Shawn did not reply. He stood by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire with his thumbs tucked into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waistband of his buckskin breeches. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no use to reply. The speaker was Joel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kalder. He was schooled in talking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly pleased when he got an audience.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could talk rings around Shawn, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shawn knew it. So he kept his silence. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply could only give Kalder something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rip apart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here we are eighty miles south of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main pass," Kalder went on. "With just</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely time to make it safely across to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oregon before snow comes. You call your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self a wagon master? W'e'll spend weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">here getting half the wagons across, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll bet it's your own freight wagon you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to take over first. Shorter route, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, but by the Lord above, man, you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">maroon us here for the winter!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHAW'N looked around the campfire. Most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the eighty people in the train were</seg><seg type="columnLine">present listening to Kalder. Shawn stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">with feet braced and took their stares.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kalder on the other side of the fire, stood in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of a wagon wheel and gestured with</seg><seg type="columnLine">OVER THE HILL TO HELL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">71</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">long, graceful hands. He was a tall, slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with quick, flashing eyes that swept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd and examined the result of every</seg><seg type="columnLine">word he said. Once he had talked of a law</seg><seg type="columnLine">practice in Oregon, but Shawn guessed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">law was only a stop-gap in Joel Raider's</seg><seg type="columnLine">career. The man was cut out for politics,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his dream was a white-pillared gover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor's mansion in this new land of Oregon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shawn shook his head and waited for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">onslaught to end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Kalder was just warming up. "¥011</seg><seg type="columnLine">want*to maroon us here!'' he said.

He looked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly at Kalder. He growled, "Shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">your damn mouth!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kalder's voice rose shrilly. "Ah, so you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to keep off that subject, don't you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shawn?

He wished Hannah hadn't spoken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kalder would quickly seize the advantage</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It seems to me, uh, Mrs. Dailey," Kalder</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "That some things may not seem clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">to those of us who are--uh--under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence, of certain others.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that, Shawn was already striding</seg><seg type="columnLine">across Ihe firelit circle swearing under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath, that no ring-tailed, slick-mouthed</seg><seg type="columnLine">shyster gunning for a political career, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk that way. But before anything de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped, a half , dozen men rose up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunged between him and the lawyer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill stopped, his face red with anger. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't do what he wanted; twist this</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawyer into a knot. Kalder was no match</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him physically. All his muscle was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated in his tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But Bill spoke his piece. He did it gruffly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and loud enough so that Kalder couldn't cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. He said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If it rains, we can't cross here. If it</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't rain, I think we can. And it gives us a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bigger chance of beatin' the snows to Oregon</seg><seg type="columnLine">than if we head norih. Those men that's got</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guts to try, can give me a hand come</seg><seg type="columnLine">mornin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He'said that and was gone. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, he sat with Hannah Dailey by her</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, after she'd put her two boys to bed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hannah was some years younger than he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">plump cheeked and full bosomed. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">six weeks since she'd lost her husband. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">very short time to be courting again, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">all said. Shawn agreed it was so. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail changed many things, and left other</seg><seg type="columnLine">things intact; one being, that Hannah had</seg><seg type="columnLine">more need of a man's help than ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hannah's husband had died before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">train left Independence. She had gone any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. To Bill, it had been clear from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">start, that she needed more help than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest could offer from time to time. Since</seg><seg type="columnLine">he offered the most help, he was around</seg><seg type="columnLine">her the most. And now he had almost for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten her husband. The trail had that wav</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. Past events were like the dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd roiled and left to settle behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You -see, Bill," she said, "Mr. Kalder</seg><seg type="columnLine">wants to be captain of the train. He knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in Oregon everyone will be so new</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they'll all have trail memories. A for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer trail captain would look big to people</seg><seg type="columnLine">--to voters."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shawn growled, "He can call himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">train captain, anything he wants, as long as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he don't stick his nose in the way of gettin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">us over this hill." He nodded up into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness where the glowering mass of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain was a black block in the cloudy</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. He squinted at the sky and felt the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his neck and cheeks. There was a cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">tang in it. He shivered, with apprehension</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than with cold. He said, "Why don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">we make Kalder commandin' general of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this train? Or admiral? That'll sound good</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the voters."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hannah laughed and her hand fell lightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his arm. But she sobered quickly, "No</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter what the title he might have, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">72</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIFTEEN WESTERN TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wants leadership. If he hadn't joined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">train late, he'd have objected to your being</seg><seg type="columnLine">elected captain. He wants no sham titles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wants leadership, power. You see?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shrugged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you know--it's said that--" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered, bit her lip, added, "You won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be angry, Bill?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What d'you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's said" that Mr. Kalder started the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rockslide that broke up the men hauling on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rope. It was just behind his place on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope that it started. You see--don't say any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, the person who told me is an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">gossip--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, that--that--" he began to bellow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's just talk!" she cried. "Maybe it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't that--maybe your pulley arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment wasn't good enough, Bill. Maybe it</seg><seg type="columnLine">just didn't work--maybe it's your fault</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rose, flaming with anger at Kalder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now turning it suddenly on her. He bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">back his retort, and pounded angrily away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Clodfoot sodbusters!" he swore to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE morning, he was up before dawn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strode up the side of the mountain to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the pulley was still chained to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock outcropping. There, he watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray waves of dawn break over the hills.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By God, he thought, if only I'd taken off</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my own wagons, alone. We could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">run to the north crossing and made it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure. We got better horses and wagons--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and men, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He swore and picked up a rock. He hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">it angrily down the slope. Jt struck a boul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der and bounced out into space. For a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was silhouetted against the hulking black</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud the new light was beginning to out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line and then arced to earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the men were coming up. Walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">sluggishly, mistrusting. Their hearts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">guts wouldn't be in the job ahead. But Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shawn tried his best.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the first man came within hearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance, he bellowed, "Where you headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, friend?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oregon!" the man yelled back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oregon?" Bill Shawn cried back. "Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">in blazes is that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Over the hill, friend! 'Vhe man panted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill bellowed, "Oregon!" again, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">all took it up until it rang down the line of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ant-like struggling men. Their figures jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they climbed, lively now and clawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">away at this mountain they meant to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quer. Those on the lower slopes were running</seg><seg type="columnLine">up toward the figure of the red-haired man</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his legs wide apart, braced firmly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountain itself. Bill Shawn boomed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oregon's movin' west faster'n you are!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took the long rope now and poked it</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the pulley. He kicked the pulley and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chain, and was reassured by the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">clanking of iron. He kicked the chain all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way around, for a faint suspicion lurked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind that someone might have tampered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it. An evil suspicion, but it floated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind. He thought, a man like Kalder</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to work a whole train of people for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own good, had made him wary. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking such thoughts made him shiver</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a long wait. Hissnerves tingled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with impatience. They came so slowly, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of the echoing cries of "Oregon!" The</seg><seg type="columnLine">polers, careful now, took their posts. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who'd heave on the spokes assembled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rest climbed up the steep slope to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill Shawn stood with the end of the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope clutched in his hands. He walked it</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to them when they had gathered, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they swarmed over the loose end until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like a swarm of bees on a dead limb.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soon the rope was lost among them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shawn went down, set his wheel men in</seg><seg type="columnLine">position and checked the tie of the rope to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wagon doubletree. He glanced once at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pine tree and the wagon wrecked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous afternoon. Then returned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope and bellowed, "Anybody know what's</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the hill?"	'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a reply, but quicker than he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected, and different.

Standing on the rock to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the chain was attached, was Joel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kalder. "It's going to rain soon, you better</seg><seg type="columnLine">get down the hill--before you can't!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried down to them. "Look at those clouds!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He pointed a long finger up at the sky.

The stagecoach hadn't even</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused. In the dust it kicked up as it rat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled on by the woukl-be and now wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">road agents, Willser took one dim look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his partner, reached down and rolled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, decided Kennedy was very dead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">departed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the posse arrived on the scene of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attempted holdup, they found Jim Ken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nedy lying in the road.

Good behavior, and his pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">personality, got him off in two months. Tt</seg><seg type="columnLine">was then that he swore to find the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had deserted him and kill him on sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without a system, without a plan, Kenne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dy set off to track Pitch Willser down.

His wanderings got him close to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarry several times. But not until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached Dodge City, did he finally see Will-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ser. It was at this first astounding sight that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Kennedy realized he would have to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient. ...</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim Kennedy arrived in Dodge City on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fourth of July. Already, he noted, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">townsfolk were lining the edges of the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">street, waiting for the parade to come along.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim took the opportunity to scan as many</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces as possible in the crowd, always hop-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that one of them would be the hated</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of Willser.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The parade came blaring along. The fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men's brass band led the gala procession.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Right- behind them paraded a fancily deco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rated buggy, new and shiny, pulled by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of matched show horses. In the buggy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one man sat and held the reins while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, in high silk hat and frock coat, bowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smiled to the spectators.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kennedy, too busy scanning the faces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd to pay attention to the bowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smiling official in the buggy, merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a quick glance toward the passing vehi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cle. Not until he resumed inspecting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces of the spectators did something regis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter in Kennedy's mind. He gasped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked again at the silk hatted gent in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buggy. The man everybody was cheering</seg><seg type="columnLine">as "Our Mayor!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our Mayor," now known as Dog Kelley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Pitch Willser. From planning for so</seg><seg type="columnLine">long to draw his sixgun and shoot, at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of his enemy, Jim reached for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun. Reason returned, and he thought bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of the move. One look at these folks told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that they would not care to have their</seg><seg type="columnLine">beloved Mayor shot dead--especially on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this great day. And Jim Kennedy had often</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard--as had the rest of the country--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dodge City people were quick to resent</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangers who were too hasty in reaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">for guns. After you'd lived around there</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a while, of course, you could use your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own judgment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITHIN the next few weeks, Jim Kenne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dy had made a few friends and was able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ask questions. He learned that Dog Kel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley had been living in Dodge City, as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">store-owner and then as mayor, for about</seg><seg type="columnLine">two years. Dog was popular and well thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of by most of the citizens. Dog Kelley was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fact, the most beloved person in Dodge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside from Dora Hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And who is this Dora Hand?" asked Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kennedy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The queen of all the dance hall girls,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the answer. "Dora is. loved and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spected by everybody, in spite of her sing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and dancing in Ham Bell's Variety Hall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kven the married women in town will asso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciate with her, because they know she's de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent, and does a lot of kind things around</seg><seg type="columnLine">here.

Jim had been around</seg><seg type="columnLine">long enough to be skeptical about the "pure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and decency" of any dance hall dames.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were, he knew, many who were moral-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly above reproach--but they were still very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much in the minority, and he couldn't re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member ever before seeing one. It was with</seg><seg type="columnLine">avid interest that he watched Dora Hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">come out on the stage and start to sing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentimental ballads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kennedy, accustomed to the hoarse, whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">key soprano voices of most variety hall lady</seg><seg type="columnLine">singers, was first surprised to hear that Dora</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hand had a truly beautiful and refined voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the same time he noticed that the lady</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked as beautiful as she sang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within five minutes, Jim Kennedy had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like most others in Dodge, fallen in love</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Dora Hand. But unlike most--who</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved her from a distance only--Jim decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do something about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Between acts he went to one of the bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenders, gave him a tip, and asked, "How</seg><seg type="columnLine">can I get introduced to Dora Hand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bar man laughed. "All strangers ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. Just introduce yourself, like you do</seg><seg type="columnLine">any dance hall girl."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, she ain't just any dance hall girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She is in a class by herself--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right," said the bartender. "But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you tipped me. Now let me tip you--don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to get too friendly with Dora.

Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because lie's been making a play for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a long time. He ain't gettin' very far.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he resents anybody else tryin to horn</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. Kind of figgers she is private property,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On hearing this, Jim Kennedy decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait no longer lo kill Mayor Dog Kelley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The very thought of such a man making a</seg><seg type="columnLine">play for such a lovely woman was enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to edge Jim into his grim decision--even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he had not yet so much as been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">within twenty yards of the saloon lady.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, playing his hand slowly, and patient-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, Jim permitted five days to go by before</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting his lethal plan into effect. Meantime,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he learned that the Mayor lived in a nice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-room house on the outskirts of town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He even ascertained which room the Mayor</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to sleep in, and found it was the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, right across the room from the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">side window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not necessarily wishing to kill anybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">under such sneaking circumstances, Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kennedy salved his conscience by telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself that, in this case, there was no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Dog had too many friends in town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also, it wasn't just for revenge that the kill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing would be done. It was to protect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lovely Dora Hand from marrying such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crook as Kelley--a man who would run</seg><seg type="columnLine">away and leave a pal for dead, in order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save his own skin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During his entire stay in Dodge City, Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">had kept out of the Mayor's sight. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy to do, once he learned which saloons the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mayor preferred. These he kept away from.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even in the variety hall, where both the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mayor and Kennedy went to see Dora's act,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kennedy always was careful not to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Dog's line of sight. Kelley never knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Jim was in town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After three nights of going over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, secretly, and laying his-final plans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim decided to act.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was shortly after midnight, pitch black</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the edge of town, when Kennedy made</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way, unseen, to the house of the Mayor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quietly sneaking around the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house on which was the bedroom window,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Kennedy, gun in hand, edged up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open window. Dimly, he could make out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed on the far side of the room. Bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his sixgun, Jim fired four shots into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumpy part of the bed coverings that told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him his quarry was there. As quietly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">surreptitiously as he had come, Jim Kennedy</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his way back to town. Satisfied with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his night's work, he went to his room in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel anti went to sleep. His long search</seg><seg type="columnLine">was over. The mission of three years stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">80</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIFTEEN WESTERN TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lng had been accomplished.

By the time he reached his</seg><seg type="columnLine">favorite hangout, the Lone Branch Saloon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he realized that the evident grief of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, gathered along the streets in large</seg><seg type="columnLine">and small groups, was more than hr had</seg><seg type="columnLine">bargained for.. Even the men in (he Lena</seg><seg type="columnLine">Branch seemed undidv sad about the pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of one Dog Kelley.

He held it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand. "Clint won't be needin' this," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">mused, and put the dollar in his pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He won't need anything--after today,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Jim Blaney slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old sheriff's gl?nce caught momentar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily on the lean, dark face of the big Cross L</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Jim Blaney and Jess McCaulley had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been partners in the ownership of the Cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">L spread. Clint Farley, hiding now some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where within the canyon, had been con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced and sentenced to life in the pen for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the murder of Jess McCaulley. Blaney had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been chief witness for the state at the trial.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From Blaney, the sheriff's gaze went slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly over the faces of those other men caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in the hasty loop with which he had gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered his posse. Hugh Miller, proprietor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the livery stable in town, small, slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">built, known for courage. Anse Larson of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Box M, crabby, cantankerous, incor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruptible. Larson's lean-flanked son. Art.

Riley</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hatch, square-faced square-bodied bronco</seg><seg type="columnLine">twister.

Perhaps he was won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering how the deputy felt about this job of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting down a man who had been his part-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, for his eyes dwelt long on Fenton's face;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he turned at last to study the frowning</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls of the canyon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You gents all knew Clint Farley," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. "You know, having gone this far,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clint's likely to go all the way.

We've got to round him up before</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was true enough, and here and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">a head nodded at the sheriff's wisdom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the sheer cliffs which rim Rawhide</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canyon are seams by which a man willing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to gamble his neck might reach the top.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By daylight, this opportunity was denied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fugitive, for the trap would be long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow, and would leave him exposed to rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire from any point within the canyon. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it Clint Farley could keep hidden until dark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or if he could hold the posse off. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SAM FENTON, big shouldered, raw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boned deputy, listened with half an ear</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the careful last instructions of the sheriff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would spread out in a line to sweep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canyon, three men to one side of the dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">creek bed, three men to the other. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">would move on slowly, keeping in touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">when possible; they would watch for tracks</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . and then Sam Fenton's thoughts strayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, and the dry voice of the sheriff was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a blur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was queer. Clint Farley was a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">victed murderer, and he, Sam Fenton, was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deputy sheriff tracking the escaped man</seg><seg type="columnLine">down so that the state might exact Jull pay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment for the crime. Yet once they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends, and partners; they had owned a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch together, and the beginnings, of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brand. But three years of hard luck had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left them broke, and other things had broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">their friendship. There had been an ugly</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist fight, and for two years or longer he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not spoken a single word to Clint Farley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Sam Fenton could find no joy in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">task which faced him now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff's voice cut through the thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell of his thoughts. "Fenton, you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blaney and Seminole can take the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope. Art Larson and Riley and me will</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the other. Mind what I say--go easy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	liked Clint Farley once, and I'd rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">take him in alive, but he's on the wrong side</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this deal. Don't take no chances with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They started. They moved forward in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ragged skirmish line that would sweep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyon clean from end to end. No chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Farley to slip past that outspread line;</seg><seg type="columnLine">no chance for him to evade discovery. Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fenton moved mechanically along the steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope, a carbine in his hand. Below, a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet or so, was Blaney. Above, an equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance, was Ed Seminole. Creeping for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward slowly, taking advantage of every bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cover which lined the hillside, closing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a desperate, dangerous man. Crossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulleys torn by spring freshets, swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">around rocks, crouching to study the wooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope ahead, to listen for the chance sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">which might betray the fugitive. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving again. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fenton shook his head. He and Clint</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farley had been partners once, and now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was creeping in to slip a noose about Far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley's neck. A deputy sheriff, sworn to up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold the law. And yet, before Farley had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever gone to trial, he had tried to mend the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breach between them. He had gone to Far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley, offering help--and Farley had told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtly to go to hell!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun beat down out of a sky that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a brazen bowl. The rocks were hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the big deputy's hands as he moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, keeping in position in that slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancing line. Below, Blaney had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallowed up by the thick growth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hillside. He caught a glimpse of Seminole,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliding shadow-swift between clumps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrub oak. A third of the big box canyons</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been covered. He dropped into a gulley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">circling a tumbled mass of rock wher« a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great chunk of stone had once crashed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall of the cliff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And a voice spoke softly, close beside him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hold it, Fenton! Reach for the sky!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not six feet away, in a bellow in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks, with a ten-foot high cut-bank at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, squatted Farley. There was a sneer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on Farley's lips. In his left hand was a rifle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his right a six-gun which hung level in</seg><seg type="columnLine">line with big Sam Fenton's chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Collecting some blood money, Fenton?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The deputy came erect. Standing there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand still gripping his carbine, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied out of pitying eyes the man who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been his partner. The man had aged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed; he was like a savage animal at</seg><seg type="columnLine">bay. His hat was gone; one cheek was</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratched; and his face was streaked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood and dirt. His bloodshot eyes glared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Clint," said Fenton slowly. "You better</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop that gun and come on back with me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not in a million years!" rasped Clint</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farley. "Go to the pen! For something I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't do--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And suddenly, standing there, the deputy</seg><seg type="columnLine">was glad that the thing had turned this way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was glad that Farley had the drop on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, that positions were not reversed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not planned it so, but, for facing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate, driven man, Sam Fenton knew he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not want to be the one to take Clint</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farley back to jail. Now the responsibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been lifted from him. In the face of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">levelled gun he was helpless. Yet there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Clint," he pointed out. "You haven't got</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance. This canyon's full of men. They'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">get you, certain sure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Farley grinned mirthlessly. "Not alive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they won't! And it's better than going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment, Sam Fenton forgot the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun that was pointing at his breast. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind flashed back to remembered facts in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case which had ended with Clint Far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley's conviction on a murder charge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Convinced of Farley's guilt, the big dep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uty had been glad when a job in the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">county had kept him from the trial, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was acquainted with the evidence which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone to convict the map. Damning enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all truth, that evidence had been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jess McCaulley, half-owner of the Cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">L, had been found dead at the gate leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his ranch-house. His gun had been in hol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster, so that it seemed that McCaulley must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been shot down in cold blood. Beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead man's hand the name "Farley" had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been spelled out in the soft dust of the road.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Because of the enmity which had existed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the two, and because Farley was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last man known to have seen McCaulley</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive, the name written in the dust had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">88</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIFTEEN WESTERN TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a powerful argument for the prosecution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor had Clint Farley, at his trial, denied</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had visited the Cross L man shortly</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he was killed. Denial would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been useless, anyhow, for Jim Blaney, Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caulley's partner in the Cross L, and Ed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seminole, a puncher for the outfit, had met</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farley as he rode away from the Cross L.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Riding on, they had found Jess McCaullev</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead beside the gate. So they had testified</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the trial.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accepting the evidence at face value, Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fenton had taken for granted the guilt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man who once had been his partner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, looking into Farley's blood-shot, glar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing eyes, the deputy remembered that Far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley, throughout the trial, had steadfastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintained that he was innocent of the mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der. Clint Farley had been plenty wild. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had drunk too much, gambled too much, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had never been a liar. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Clint," said Fenton suddenly, "you got</seg><seg type="columnLine">no chance to get away. This canyon's bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled tighter than a drum. Give me your gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If you didn't kill Jess McCaullev, I give you</seg><seg type="columnLine">my word I'll never quit until I clear you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fugitive's lips curled back in a sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age mocking grin. "Go to hell! " he snapped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I want no favors from you--now or ever!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You and me got all our business caught up</seg><seg type="columnLine">long ago. You whipped me once, but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I got the drop! Cut loose your gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They'll get you, Clint. You got no</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let 'em!" Farley was snarling now. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't go to the pen. Unhook that belt. I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate to have to drill you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE HAD taken his stand in a hollow in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocks at the gulley's edge, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten-foot high cutbank behind him. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, watching that passion-torn face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam Fenton caught his breath. At the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cut-bank behind Farley appeared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, the figure of a man. Jim Blaney!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And a great wave of relief swept over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fenton then, for he saw that they would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to take Farley in alive. Covered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farley's gun, he watched dispassionately</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Blaney leaned far out over the bank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He watched the six-gun level in the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's hand. He waited for the crisp com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand that would end the situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clint Farley moved impatiently. "Damn</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, unloose that gun belt!" he snapped. His</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gun lifted menacingly. "I won't tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">again!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still Blaney did not announce himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leaning far out over the bank, gun poised</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand, he still delayed the sharp com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand that would make Farley prisoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, all at once, Sam Fenton realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there would be no command. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be no word of warning for the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who covered from behind. Blaney's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a dark mask of hatred, and his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">was set in a cruel line. He was going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot Clint Farley in the back! His thumb</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on the hammer--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No time, then, for Fenton to shout a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanvng. Hardly time for thought. Swifter</seg><seg type="columnLine">than thought was the deputy in action.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ignoring Farley's gun, leveled at his breast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deputy stabbed for his Colt. The gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up spouting. Blaney, the avenger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed off balance by the slug, let the gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">slip from his fingers, and stumbled at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very edge of the bank. He grasped desper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately for a handhold as he tottered, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">tripped and pitched head foremost into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guiley. Blaney threw out an unavailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm in the instant before his head struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a rock. Then the big Cross L man</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay quiet and still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Farley had spun around as Blaney fell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now he looked at the deputy. A long mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of silence, and Sam Fenton spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinilv: "He was going to plug you in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had a dead -drop," said Clint Farley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was a queer look in his eyes. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">went for your gun. You knew you was</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking chances. Why did you do it, Sam?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam Fenton grinned at him. "You didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know Blaney was there," he said. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have figured I was drawing down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Why didn't you shoot, Clint?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They studied each other in that sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drenched hillside. Slowly Clint Farley shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head. "Let it go, Sam. I'm obliged."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He dropped his Colt into the holster. "Call</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheriff and let's get back to town."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam Fenton stooped and turned the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious Blaney on his back. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bump on the Cross L man's forehead where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had brought up against the rock; blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">was slowly blotting out the color on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right sleeve of Blaney's shirt. The deputy</seg><seg type="columnLine">slit the sleeve, folded it back. His hasty</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot had torn a jagged hole through Blaney's</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper arm. With a bandage he stopped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">BRING HIM BACK DEAD!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flow of blood. Frowning, he regarded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare, smooth-muscled arm of the Cross L</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Across Blaney's forearm, still faintly pink,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the welt of a freshly healed scar, a scar</seg><seg type="columnLine">that must have been burned there by a bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let! For a moment he looked at the scar</seg><seg type="columnLine">with thoughtful eyes, but when at last he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke it was about another matter altogeth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He meant to drill you in the back, Clint,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he muttered. "That sort's peculiar. Did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">have anything agin' you? Personal, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've had plenty of trouble with the Cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">L outfit ever since I homesteaded next to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them," said Clint Farley slowly. "Blaney</seg><seg type="columnLine">and McCaulley both! Blaney and me had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight six months or so ago. I took a gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him, and whipped him all over a cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ral. He seemed kinda provoked about it at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He was the gent who found McCaulley."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Farley nodded. "Him and Ed Seminole."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you and Seminole stack up?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jest a drinking acquaintance. Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Sam Fenton shook his head. A hunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">was troubling the big deputy now--a queer</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunch that he was not willing to try to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">in words. On the day following the killing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Jess McCaulley, Sam Fenton had gone in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the little Saddle Rock bank on business.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Blaney had been standing at the cash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ier's window when he entered, and Fenton</seg><seg type="columnLine">had waited at Blaney's elbow while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cross L man scrawled off a check. And a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little fact, meaningless, then, and unimpor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant, had lodged in a corner of Fenton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind--a little fact forgotten until now. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blaney, writing, had moved his hand in</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow and careful strokes. So a man with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sore arm might write!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOW crouching in a gulley in Rawhide</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canyon, Sam Fenton was adding up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">score. Always, heretofore, he had assumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Clint Farley had killed Jess McCaulley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now he was not sure. On Jim Blaney's arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a fresh scar that must be a bullet burn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blaney had been troubled with a sore arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the day after his partner was found mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered. Sam Fenton lifted puzzled eyes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clint Farley, fugitive from justice, hunkered</seg><seg type="columnLine">there beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Clint," he said, "I never got to take in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your trial. There was one thing I remember</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing which seemed funny at the time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Way I heard it, the testimony was that Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caulley's gun was in the holster, but that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had two empty shells."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was the how of it," agreed Farley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A normal, thoughtful gent carries an</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty to cradle his firing pin," mused Fen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton. "Only a plumb careless hombre would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have two empty shells in his gun. An' Jess</seg><seg type="columnLine">McCaulley was never careless."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Which tallies up to how much?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Clint," said the deputy, deadly serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, "mebbe Jess McCaulley died with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun in his hand--might be he even got in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot before he died. That would account for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the empty shell. "Mebbe the gent what killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him put the gun back in the holster, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, knowin' you and McCaulley had trou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble, wrote your name there in the dust."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clint Farley nodded agreement. "I fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger something like that happened. But you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't make a jury believe that kind of story.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not without knowing who killed McCaulley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or having some sort of proof to back up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yarn."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that was true. The evidence which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had convicted Farley, while wholly circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantial, was yet so strong that absolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof would be required to overthrow it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam Fenton recognized that fact. Two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">had furnished the evidence. One of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now lying unconscious at his feet. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, Ed Seminole, was still somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher up on the steep side of the canyon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hunch was prodding the big deputy</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. The time was short. Blaney was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconscious, but he might recover at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. Other members of the posse might</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear, drawn by the single shot. Sam Fen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton did not want that to happen--not yet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had a plan, a wildly fantastic, utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">hare-brained plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lifting his head carefully above the mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rocks he searched the hillside at the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where last he had seen Seminole. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">some little time before he found his man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seminole, made cautious, by the revolver</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot, crouched in the shadow of a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinon tree, but even as Fenton spotted him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cross L man began a slow advance on</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and knees. He was evidently taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">no unnecessary chances. He reached a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulder in his path, crouched there to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">connoiter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam Fenton, completely hidden from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seminole's view by the depression in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">90</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIFTEEN WESTERN TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he stood, picked up his rifle. Clint Farley</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him with puzzled eyes. The deputy</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust the rifle barrel between two rocks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at Farley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This ain't accordin' to Hoyle," he mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered. "But I never did like Seminole, no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A dead shot with rifle or revolver, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">squinted along the sights. Seminole's high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowned white Stetson appeared above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulder as the Cross L man scanned the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ritory before him. Slowly Fenton tightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pressure on the trigger. The rifle barked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The white Stetson leaped in a little arc, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though jerked by a string.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clint Farley's face was a study in amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment as the deputy flipped a fresh shell into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chamber. Seminole had dropped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight behind the boulder. Unfortunately for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the puncher, the boulder he had selected was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not quite large enough to offer complete pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tection. One boot projected. Again Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fenton fired. The boot twitched slightly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared from view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, a grim smile curving his lips, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big deputy emptied the magazine in a hail</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lead which spattered above the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheltering the hapless Seminole. The rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered protection of a sort. Nothing more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No chance for Seminole to return the fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">without exposing himself to that deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusillade. Lead slugs flattened against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock, kicked up dust along its edges, plucked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at bits of clothing shown by the unhappy</seg><seg type="columnLine">puncher. The high-walled cliffs sent back</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling echoes of the gun-fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The magazine was empty. Sam Fenton</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at Blaney. The man was still uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious. Grinning at the puzzled Farley, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big deputy filled the magazine and returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the bombardment. Spacing his shots, fir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with sure accuracy, again he emptied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the direness of his need, Seminole con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trived to make the boulder shelter him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not offer to return the fire. He was play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing dead, wise enough under the circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances, for he knew that presently other</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of the posse would be coming to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid. Likewise, Sam Fenton knew it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned to Farley. "Slip down the gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley, Clint," he suggested. "There's some</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush down there where you can hide. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to make peace with Seminole, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want you out of sight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sam," murmured Farley, "this heat has</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fried your brain. What fool crazy notion--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Get outa sight before I take a shot at</seg><seg type="columnLine">you," said Fenton. "I got me a scheme."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sorrowfully Farley shook his head, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped down the gulley to disappear from</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight behind a clump of brush. The deputy</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched until he was gone. Then he lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice to a bellow:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho, Seminole!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Seminole answered hoarsely: "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hell yuh want?" ,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I got him, Seminole," called Fenton. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood up, facing the man who still crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the rock. After a moment Seminole</seg><seg type="columnLine">came warily to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Cross L man's head was bare. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a bloody smear across his face where</seg><seg type="columnLine">a splinter of rock had torn his cheek. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">boot heel had been shot away. He stooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pick up the white Stetson, then came for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. scowling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mister," he said as he drew near, "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">right damn' glad yuh showed. That buzzard</seg><seg type="columnLine">made this canyon plenty hot 'Tor me. Shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">my damn hat off!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came on, limping slightly, dragging his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle. He reached the edge of the gulley, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could look down into the rocks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly the scowl upon his face was blotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. and incredulity took its place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's Blaney!" he cried.. "What the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hell! Where's Farley?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam Fenton shrugged. "That's Blaney.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's all I bagged so far. Funny, eh? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' him blazing away at each other--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a queer expression on Ed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seminole's face as he looked down at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconscious man. "Yuh mean to tell me--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he began angrily. "Yuh mean to say--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam Fenton tried to explain. "Shucks!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said soothingly. "He thought you was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farley. "An' you thought he was Farley."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hell!" rasped Seminole. "He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">damn well I wasn't Farley! I was behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him! He shot my hat off--an' Farley never</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no hat--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must be wrong, Seminole." Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fenton's voice was soft. "That don't tally</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. Why would Blaney shoot at you, if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't a mistake?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why?" Seminole's face was venomous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll tell yuh why. Because he owes me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars, an' he figgered to pay it</seg><seg type="columnLine">off in lead! He thought--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another voice interrupted. Jim Blaney's</seg><seg type="columnLine">BRING HIM BACK DEAD!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">91</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">voice! "What's wrong?" he asked groggily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blaney was lifting an arm to shield his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face from the sun. A patch of blood showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his forehead, and his eyes were dazed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looked up at the two men. Seminole</seg><seg type="columnLine">glared down at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's wrong?"- he jeered. "Yore little</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan miscarried, that's all! Yuh figgered it</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheaper to kill me off than pay me off! Safer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too! Nobody would be left to know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">yuh killed Jess McCaulley! An' Farley</seg><seg type="columnLine">would get the blame."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Jim Blaney stared up at that furious</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with slowly comprehending glance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Painfully the big Cross L man lifted him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to a sitting position. His dark face</seg><seg type="columnLine">twitched as he turned his glance momentar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily from Seminole to Sam Fenton. "Smart,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "Smart as hell!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was unarmed. The deputy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked the six-gun from his hand, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">his holster was empty. He sat there on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, looking up at Seminole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yuh've said enough now, Seminole."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Enough!" rasped Seminole. "Yuh're</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong, Blaney! Wait till I tell the story in</seg><seg type="columnLine">court! Wait till I tell a jury how yuh</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheated Jess McCaulley--an' killed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he found yuh out! An' offered me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars to testify he was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly, painfully, Jim Blaney got to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. He was unarmed. He had been tricked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he knew it, but he could not know the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner by which it had been accomplished.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A thin smile twisted his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I promised you a thousand dollars," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated softly. Then, suddenly, swiftly, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved. His left hand snaked a hide-out gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For an instant he stood still, gun balanced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yuh yellow rat!" he snarled. "I'll pay yuh</seg><seg type="columnLine">off--in full!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fired. The slug sent Seminole reeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward, hands clutching empty air. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw another bullet at the swaying man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Seminole went down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam Fenton's Colt leaped from his hol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster. Blaney whirled on him, but Fenton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun was belching lead. A brace of slugs</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the Cross L man at the belt line. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered back. The gun slipped from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers. Clint Farley, Colt uplifted rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the gulley just as Blaney went down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam Fenton bent above Seminole. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had been hit twice, and hard, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned faintly at the deputy. "I'm all</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight," he whispered. "I'll live--long</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">enough." He tried to raise himself up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Clint Farley said: "Here's the sheriff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Take it easy, Seminole'," said Fenton</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gently.

The town loved a fight like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, the meeting of two quick-draw artists</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Con Pardee and Steve Jordan.

Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe, simply his last drink. After a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, the piano started up again and talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the bar was resumed.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tittered, confident in his immunity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steve put his drink down slowly, feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the angry knotting of the hard muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">across his shoulders.

No</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter followed him, but he knew it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come as soon as they were sure he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was out of earshot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UE PUSHED through the Saturday</seg><seg type="columnLine">night crowds that surged in both di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rections along the flare-lit boardwalk, walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as rapidly as he could, past the Keeno</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bar, the bank, Laird's feed store, theJrli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lo-Jack, the Nugget, the Granada, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Den, the Unique Cafe, the Blue Chip--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he crossed the dust-filled ruts of Main</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street and paused a moment before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen door of Iris Manning's millinery</seg><seg type="columnLine">shop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was alone in her shop, balanced pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cariously on a chair while she reached high</seg><seg type="columnLine">above her head to put a box on the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelf. Her soft blonde hair was caught at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nape of her neck with a wisp of yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribbon; the tip of a tiny pink tongue came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to touch her upper lip as she struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to push the box back, farther on the shelf.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing Iris could do, Steve reflected,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could ever disguise the lush beauty of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">young body. Just now, standing on tip-toe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sideways to him, she presented a picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">that helped to wash the turmoil and anger</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his mind. She wasn't even trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceal her curves tonight, and the bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress she wore hugged her narrow waist</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swelling hips so snugly that Steve won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered it didn't burst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He opened the screen and closed it quiet-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ly behind him and took a step toward her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hello, Iris," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice startled her. She gasped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed futilely at the shelf as the chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">wobbled beneath her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sprang forward, catching her just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chair skidded away. For an instant she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a soft, warm whirl of flaring skirts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slim silken legs in his arms--and then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wriggled loose and slid to her feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Close," Steve said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She smiled up at him. "Steve! You</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened me!" But the smile was short-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived, and suddenly the green eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloudy. He knew she was thinking about it</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, about the gun fight--about Con Par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dee. He reached out and caught her in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose circle of his arms, and she stood there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking up at him, trying to smile again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somehow, holding her for what might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last time was like holding her for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time. Everything seemed clearer, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">intense, than it had in two years. And she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was even more beautiful now than she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been then. Honey blonde hair and warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">green eyes and a body that made a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt just to look at it. He wished he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">prolong this moment, stretch it out through</seg><seg type="columnLine">eternity. He breathed in the delicate scent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her, and suddenly he wanted to take her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ride a thousand miles away from Fever</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wells and Con Pardee . . . ride away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">never even look back over his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He said, "I reckon you've seen Con."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She nodded, not meeting his eyes now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They came out then, the words he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined not to utter. "You never got</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him, did you, Iris?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her wide-set eyes came up, slowly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they held an expression he had never seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">there before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Steve, I ...

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">street in front of it was deserted, as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known it would be. This was to be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage, the arena. He paused, looking across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wagon ruts at the garish front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inferno. On either side of the ornate bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings had been painted a red devil eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet tall.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">devils on either side of him writhed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flare light. The single gun on his right leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">glinted dully. It was the first time Steve</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever known him to wear but one gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pardee let the batwings swing shut be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him and stepped out on the boardwalk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, St*ve thought.

But the gun was no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its leather. His right gun had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked fronwhis hand, and now his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun must have fallen out of its holster</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a bullet knocked him to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard a man shout, and somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman screamed.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would wing him, he'd said--and then kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with his bare hands. And he'd winged</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, all right! Even with that blazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, he'd been accurate as a man could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be. And now he was lunging forward to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep the second part of his promise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steve watched him coming, sick in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge that his strategy had failed.

He looked for his guns.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw one of them, half buried in the dust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was too far away to help him now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TTE DUG his toes into the dust, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slithered to one side a split instant be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore Pardee's heavy body crashed into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own.

But the Judge was in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunk, asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Big Pete Enright reached up and took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Injun List from its place on the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar.

The gray light that filtered</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the big windows gave the place a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismal appearance. The stench of tobacco</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke and stale beer hung heavy in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. The Judge shuddered with nausea. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed a bracer. He was pouring it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsteady hands when he happened to no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tice the Injun List propped against an</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty bottle on the bar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bottle and glass he had been hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing slid from his grip, smashing on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. He stood there, bloodshot eyes star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the list. Disbelief, something akin</seg><seg type="columnLine">to horror, showed in his eyes. His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as gray as the dawn that showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the windows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood there a long time. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up the Injun List and put it back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its accustomed place.

Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve, every fiber of his wracked body</seg><seg type="columnLine">called for whiskey, but he did not take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink. When his work was finished he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out the back way to his cabin, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the morning bartender came on shift.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once in his little log cabin he sat down</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakly on the edge of his bunk.

In this rush for gold they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">too busy to care why an old bar-fly failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show up.

He would stand there a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time, his mop in his hand, a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">look in his blue eyes, which no longer held</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spark of a twinkle. It was as if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">reviewing his past, delving back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried thoughts, torturing himself with bit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter memories. His gaze focused on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Injun List, on the name that headed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">list. "The Judge." Then he would go</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to work, looking older, his cheeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">more gray, the luster gone from his eves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There must have been times during those</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismal hours when the Judge hated big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pete Enright. Hated him as a man can</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate but few men. But there were other</seg><seg type="columnLine">times, when he was shut in his cabin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm, sheltered from the blizzards, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">grub supply well stocked, tobacco to smoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he remembered that Pete Enright</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given him all this. Even the set of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shakespeare, the battered law library, other</seg><seg type="columnLine">books that Pete had picked up somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had donated to the cabin, books that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had kept the Judge from going mad at</seg><seg type="columnLine">times, the gift of the one man in town who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had befriended him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete Enright had found him drunk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep in a snowbank behind the saloon</seg><seg type="columnLine">one night. Pete had thawed him out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staked him to the cabin, given him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">last chance to mingle with men once more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pete Enright had befriended him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Judge felt that he owed him a debt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor. Even though Pete had put him on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Injun List. It was hard to hate a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Pete Enright because Pete never</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought the enmity of any man. The Judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that. Besides, the Judge had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">known how to hate. That was perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">why he did what he did, right there at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You see, Pete Enright had gotten in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time during the night. It was snow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hard and the town had gone to bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">early. Only a few men in town knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pete was back from Butte. He had come</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">back to buy up some mining claims. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause he always made cash deals, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought the money with him. Fifty thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand dollars in currency. He had it in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket when he let himself into the Last</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chance just about dawn. He wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put the money in the safe. The night bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tender had locked up. The place was</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty. Pete turned on the light in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office and squatted on his heels to open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe. As he swung the door open a voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him spoke evenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up with 'em, Enright. Plenty high.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Make a move that looks bad and we'll kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">you." Pete raised his hands slowly as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to his feet. His back was still turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the man who had ordered him to stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em up. He had on a long coonskin coat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its frogs fastened. No chance of getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his gun in its shoulder holster. Not an</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy job to put up a fight in a big fur coat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevertheless, Pete took a chance. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't care about the money so much. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Pete Enright, the big mygul in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp, to be stuck up, that was what rubbed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He ducked and whirled. A gun roared in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face. He fell the hot thud of a bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his shoulder. Then he was fighting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three men who piled onto him, clubbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his head with guns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Judge had seen the light in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon as he came in the back way. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed the night bartender had forgot</seg><seg type="columnLine">to put out the lights when he went off</seg><seg type="columnLine">shift. Carrying his bucket and mop he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in the back door, then stood frozen in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tracks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up in front, behind the frosted-glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">partition that marked the office, a terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight was going on. The Judge heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice of Pete Enright, snarling curses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Other voices calling to each other drowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">it out. Then someone said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kill 'im, boys. We got to, now. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows us. Git Enright!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a gun behind the bar. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">single-action .45. The Judge set down his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bucket and mop and slipped along the bar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now he rounded the end of the bar and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand gripped the gun. He didn't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">much about a gun. He had never owned</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much as a .22 rifle. But he knew enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to thumb back the hammer and pull the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trigger, aiming wildly at the three men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had clubbed burly Pete Enright to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">POKER 11|</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHECKS V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Famous Hub Checks, Non-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Duplicate,Square Edge,Heavi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">est Game Check, Cut and Suck</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Accurately.

He could not ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plain it to them. He hadn't the words. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">now he wasn't inclined to talk. He began to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">climb. He pulled himself up the taut rope,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clawing his boots at the slope. He climbed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">steadily without speaking, looking directly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up at the man on the rock. He thought only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that they were going to Oregon, and going</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there now, and no slick-mouthed shyster</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would stand in the way!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Kalder cried, "You can't touch me--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but his voice quavered as he cried out. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">saw Shawn advancing relentlessly, big hands</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hauling steadily at the rope, lifting himself</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as steadily and forcefully up the slope as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">another man might descend. Now Kalder</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cried, "I'll stop you, Shawn, I'll stop you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from leading us to ruin!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">RALDER'S long hand plunged into his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pocket. He pulled out a revolver, a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heavy, short-barreled weapon. He waved it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">around his head and then leveled it on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bill Shawn's face and cocked it. "I'll stop</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you, stop you! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Better call for some rain to stop me,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Shawn growled, and climbed on. It was only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">twenty feet now and he saw the man's boots</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bracing on the rock as wind threatened to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">topple him. He saw Kalder's coat whip, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then like a sudden blossoming, a red flash</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the man's fist. For a second it hid his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fist and the gun. With one screaming swipe,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Shawn's hat was flung off and the bullet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rapped and tore at his head. He shook his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">head and dragged himself on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Bill saw that Kalder had been thrown off</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">balance by the kick of the gun and reckoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">OVER THE HILL TO HELL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he wasn't used to it. Gleefully Shawn re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flected that a lawyer's best weapon was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue, and Kalder was realizing that too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late. Like a great ape swarming up that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope, Shawn flung all his strength into a last</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurt up to the rock, and hurled himself at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the legs of the man standing on it. He heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deafening blast of the gun, but grasping</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of Kalder's boots in his fist, he wrenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it. The lawyer's weight left him and h6</seg><seg type="columnLine">went flopping through the air to tumble and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash down below. Shawn looked down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Kalder's coattails flapping as the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtled down towards the group of men on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rope. Then Kalder stopped falling, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay gulping for air at their feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shawn panting, nodded grimly. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushed his hands on his levis and bellowed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Git onto that rope, we're headed Oregon</seg><seg type="columnLine">way!" And he felt it in his voice again; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sureness, the certainty, that they would make</seg><seg type="columnLine">it up this ledge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He clambered down the rope to the others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they heaved. They glanced once at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloodied lawyer sitting against a rock hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his head in his hands, and heaved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly, the wagon began to inch its way up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slope. They heaved, laughing, cheering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasting breath on yells. The wagon inched</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to that open, almost-flat place by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock. It rammed the rock with a quiver that</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook its whole framework, and the polers</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed *wagon tongues through from wheel</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wheel, until at last, there was a wagon</seg><seg type="columnLine">perched on top of the mountain. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those days when they tooled fast across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plateau fearing snow, Shawn was often</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Hannah, riding beside her on the seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her Conestoga.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said one day, "You ruined a promis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing career in politics, Shawn."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He grinned.

Also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt he wouldn't be so all alone in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">new misery when the Mink crowd returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the torchlight funeral. "I don't pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">off until the other boys come back and tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that Jed is definitely buried in the bone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having learned the lesson about "many</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slip ..." the Welch crowd agreed to wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">until proof positive came in that Mink had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been duly interred. They had not long to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the burial party came whooping</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the warmth of the- saloon they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted by Big Tim's anxious, but foolish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">question, "Did you bury Mink in the bone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had. Tenderly and with grim final-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity. Jed Mink had, beyond all shadow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a doubt, made the boneyard before Pike</seg><seg type="columnLine">Welch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In that case," shouted Big Tim Mal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loy, "all you crooks what I paid off too</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon, by mistake, will kindly give me back</seg><seg type="columnLine">the money. I gotta' give it to the rightful</seg><seg type="columnLine">winners; the ones who bet on Mink."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the gathered railroaders, this was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hilarious remark. They howled the worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Malloy down. Although they had been split</seg><seg type="columnLine">into two separate groups, there were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal bad feelings. Neither Mink nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Welch had been especially popular--both</seg><seg type="columnLine">being foremen--and the two factions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely split when it came to the betting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now they had suddenly joined together in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a common cause. Railroad builders versus</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Tim Malloy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took only a few minutes of rugged per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suasion to convince Big Tim that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to pay off--again. Tears were rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">down his fat hog-like cheeks as he doled</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, for the second time, money to the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ners. The new winners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Big Tim had nothing left, now, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">portable saloon and his. stock of cheap whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">key. Later that night one of the whiskey</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrels exploded. The resultant fire com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely destroyed the saloon and its con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Big Tim suddenly found out that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to demean himself and go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, if he wanted to continue eating with</seg><seg type="columnLine">regularity. Within a week he was reluc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tantly at hard labor--as a Union Pacific</seg><seg type="columnLine">track layer.

He got three</seg><seg type="columnLine">cartridges into place and jerked the cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut. Cole Tolman was on his knees then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun still in his hand. Jesse's shot was</seg><seg type="columnLine">low and he saw Cole's legs slam out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">under him.

When he reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge of the low hills he stopped and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into the valley. Down below he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the few lights of the little town and fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther down the valley, near the dark outline</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the river, he could see the lights of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barn and a few people moving around it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched them for a moment, his mjnd quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lonely. One more town left behind, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought as he turned the horse back onto the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail, but out ahead of him somewhere, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness, was another one.
