            <seg type="columnLine"> My new stable was not as clean as the others I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had known. The moss had not been changed for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">many days and everything was soiled and dusty.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">There were a dozen stalls and in each was a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">male Thut. They were slow, lethargic men crea-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tures, most of them, standing or lying dumbly in</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> In the next stall to mine there was a heavy,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and he spent most of his time lying apathetically</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">upon the flooring. That night I spoke to him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and, after a time, he condescended to answer</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">some of my questions. I asked him what the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">growth very rapidly. They reach their maturity</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in about one year of earth time. I imagine it is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">this fact, together with their lack of thumbs,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that explains the failure of the human race on</seg>
