Did Mary secretly think that too?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And after all, wasn't it true that I had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">"wish-bone" where my back-bone ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be? Wasn't that why I never had a "chance"</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get ahead? It was true, only too true--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it had taken this cruel blow to my self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esteem to make me see it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a new determination I thumbed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pages of a magazine on the table, searching</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor an advertisement that I'd seen many</seg><seg type="columnLine">times but passed up without thinking, an ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertisement telling of big opportunities for</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained men to succeed in the great new</seg><seg type="columnLine">Radio field. With the advertisement was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coupon offering a big free book full of infor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mation. I sent the coupon in, and in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">days received a handsome 64-page book,</seg><seg type="columnLine">printed in two colors, telling all about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunities in the radio field and how a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man can prepare quickly and easily at home</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take advantage of these opportunities. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">• •'d the book carefully, and when I finished</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I made my decision</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHAT'S happened in the twelve months</seg><seg type="columnLine">since that day, as I've already told you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems almost like Iream to me now. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten of those tweiv inths, I've had a Radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">business of my own! At first, of course, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">started it as a little proposition on the side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the guidance of the National Radio In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitute, the outfit that gave me my Radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">training. It wasn't long before I was getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much to do in the Radio line that I quit</seg><seg type="columnLine">my measly little clerical job, and devoted my</seg><seg type="columnLine">full time to my Radio business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since that time I've gone right on up, al</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways under the watchful guidance of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends at the National Radio Institute. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have given me just as much help, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I had wanted to follow some other line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Radio besides building my own retail busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness--such as broadcasting, manufacturing</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimenting, sea operating, or any one ol</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the score of lines they prepare you for. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think that until that day I sent for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye-opening book, I'd been wailinp "I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a chance!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOW I'm making real money.

If it becomes</seg><seg type="columnLine">ftossible tr- iif.-ig.itc a space flyti outside of the terrestrial</seg><seg type="columnLine">alnio.'plKTc. even if only to such a comparatively near body</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the moon, then immediately an important popular con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ception becomes a certain impossibility. I refer to the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent inhabitation of reasoning beings on other planets, at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">■of our own universe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The reason is simple If we can navigate a space flyer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">let us say. to Mars or Venus, then it may be assumed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">none ,1 tin planets is now peopled by icasoning, intelligent</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings.	*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This theoretical reasoning is elementary, simply because,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we do the thing first, we are probably the only reasoning</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings in our own universe, otherwise older civilizations</seg><seg type="columnLine">would undoubtedly have visited us first. There is a reser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vation to this in the case of Mars and of the moon. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite within the bounds of possibility that were Mars or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon inhabited by highly intelligent beings, they might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have tried a landing on earth long before the earth had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become habitable for other intelligent beings. If a landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been tried, the reconnoitering party in their space flyers</seg><seg type="columnLine">would probably have had to turn back, because the shores</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the earth several million years ago were probably unfit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to set foot upon. Thus it is quite possible that if intelligent</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings existed on the moon or Mars, they have had to return</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their own abode, where their race finallv died out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If this were the case, traces of their civilization would</seg><seg type="columnLine">very likely be found by the first space flying pp.rtv that set</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot on either the moon or Mars. This reasoning is anal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ogous to that concerning the cycle through which the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">is passing now. If. for instance, we were to try to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a landing on either Jupiter or Saturn today, we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">find that it was impossible, because these planets are still in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a semi-plastic state, which, of course, would make them im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to live on. These planets and a number of others</seg><seg type="columnLine">are thus in the same condition as the earth was millions of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                  e-Flvtr" was first used by the author in his story</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ralph 124C41+, published iir 1911.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">years ago and they are slowly cooling and solidifying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Next we come to some other important considerations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There is a chance that Mars, and indeed, other planets</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">belonging to other parts of our universe, may be peopled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with beings of intelligence far higher than our own. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">may have space flyers, and yet may be prevented from visit-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing our earth, for the following reasons:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It is one thing to construct a practical space flyer which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fits many conditions theoretically, but it is another thing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">altogether to navigate it successfully in space. An analogy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to this might be found in the present achieved state of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">airplane. It is theoretically possible to fly an airplane across</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">any of our oceans, but for practical reasons, it is a tre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mendous risk and will remain so for some years. In space</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flying, however, we have obstacles that may' never be over-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">come, and which make the attempt so hazardous that it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">becomes folly to attempt it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It is well known today that the space between our heavenly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bodies is not just one great and empty vacuum. Quite the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">contrary, it is pretty much alive with meteors and other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">small bodies that constantly hurtle through space at tre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mendous speeds. Nor are these meteors infrequent. It is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">known that their distribution is rather dense, and it may</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be doubted whether a space flyer could be sent from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">earth to the moon without encountering dozens of such</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">celestial projectiles, traveling at speeds of as high as four</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">miles per second, which would annihilate anything with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which they came in contact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We are fortunate that our earth possesses an atmosphere,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">because the nicteors entering the tipper strata of our gaseous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">envelope are ignited by th_ friction and usually are reduced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to dust before they Travel very far. This meteoric dust</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">settles upon the earth gradually.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Out in free space, where there is no atmosphere, no such</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">protection exists. The space flyer would probably not know</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of his impending fate, until one of these bodies was imme-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">diately upon him; and then it would be too late. There is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a chance that S':ne instruments might be invented with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which to ascertain the approach of a meteor while it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is still thousands cf miles away. Thus its course could he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plotted quickly enough by some electrical means, perhaps</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by using high vacuum tube amplification, and so possibly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">enable the space flyer to steer away quickly enough. I f there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are too many, as is most likely the case, then even with such</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">protection it would certainly be impossible to dodge all the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">meteorites at all times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Furthermore, another danger of which we know little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as yet, is the newly discovered Milliken Cosmic Ray. We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">know that these rays abound in open space, to a much</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">greater extent than on earth. What these rays are capable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of doing to the space flyer, has not yet been ascertained. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">may be that the forces of this cosmic ray are such that it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would prevent a space flyer travelling any distance at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Hugo Gernsback speaks every Tuesday at 9.30 P.

He had seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement of her pale arm amidst the thicket--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very keen-eyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that she forgot the squirrel and set off through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the alders and reeds as fast as she could go.

She splashed nearly knee-deep through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swampv place, and saw in front of her a slope of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferns--growing more slender and green as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed up out of the light into the shade of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young chestnuts. She was soon amidst the trees--</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was very fleet of foot, and she ran on and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the forest was old and the vales great, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vines about their stents where the light cafne were</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick as young trees, and the ropes of ivy stout and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight. On she went and she doubled and doubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and then at last lay down amidst some ferns</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a hollow place near a thicket, and listened with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her heart beating in her ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She heard footsteps presently rustling among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead leaves, far off. and they died away and every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was still again, except the scandalising of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">midges--for the evening was drawing on--and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">incessant whisper of the leaves. She laughed silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think the cunning Uya should go by her. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not frightened. Sometimes, playing with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other girls and lads, she had fled into the wood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though never so far as this.

But the pat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter came nearer, they were not feeding as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandered but going fast--or else they would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtake her--and she caught the limb of a tree,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung on to it, and ran up the stem with something</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the agility of a monkey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down below the sharp bristling backs of the switae</seg><seg type="columnLine">were already passing when she looked.

He passed, and was still within</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing, when something else, something large and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with grizzled fur. swinging along with soft swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">strides, came rushing in pursuit of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EUDENA suddenly became rigid, ceased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathe, her clutch convulsive, and her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had never seen the thing before, she did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even see him clearly now, but she knew at once it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Terror of the Woodshade. His name was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">legend, the children would frighten one another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">frighten even themselves with his name, and run</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming to the squatting-place. No man had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed any of his kind. Even the mighty mammoth</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared his anger. It was the grizzly bear, the lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world as the world went then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he ran he made a continuous growling grum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble. "Men in my very lair! Fighting and blood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the very mouth of my lair. Men, men, men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fighting and blood." For he was the lord of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood and of the caves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long after he had passed she remained, a girl of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone, staring down through the branches. All her</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of action had gone from her. She gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">by instinct with hands and knees and feet. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time before she could think, and then only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing was clear in her mind, that the Terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">was between her and the tribe--that it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible to descend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently when her fear was a little abated she</seg><seg type="columnLine">clambered into a more comfortable position, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great branch forked. The trees rose about her. so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she could see nothing of Brother Fire, who is</seg><seg type="columnLine">black by day. Birds began to stir, and things that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone into hiding for fear of her movements</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept out. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a time the taller branches flamed out at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of the sunset. High overhead the rooks, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were wiser than men, went cawing home to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatting-places among the elms. Looking down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">things were clearer and darker. Eudena thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">going back to the souatti"g-place; she let herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">down some way, and then the fear of the Terror of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Woodshade came again. While she hesitated, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rabbit squealed dismally, and she dared not descend</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shadows gathered, and the deeps of the forest</seg><seg type="columnLine">began stirring. Eudena went up the tree again to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be nearer the light. Down below the shadows came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of their hiding-places and walked abroad. Over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">A STORY OF THE STONE AGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">729</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">head the blue deepened. A dreadful stillness came,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then the leaves began whispering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eudena shivered and thought of Brother Fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shadows now were gathering in the trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they sat on the brandies and watched her. Branches</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaves were turned to ominous, quiet, black</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapes that would spring on her if she stirred. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white owl, flitting silently, came ghostly through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shades. Darker grew the world and darker,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until *.e leaves and twigs against the sky were black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ground was hidden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She remained there all night, an age-long vigil,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straining her ears for the things that went on below</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the darkness, and keeping motionless lest some</seg><seg type="columnLine">stealthy beast should discover her. Man in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">days was never alone in the dark, save for such rare</seg><seg type="columnLine">accidents as this. Age after age he had learnt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesson of its terror--a lesson we poor children of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his have nowadays painfully to unlearn. Eudena.</seg><seg type="columnLine">though in age a woman, was in heart like a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">child. She kept as still, poor little animal, as a hare</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ll/ore it is started.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stars gathered and watched her--her one</seg><seg type="columnLine">grain of comfort. In one bright one she fancied</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was something like Ugh-lomi. Then she fan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cied it was Ugh-lomi. And near him, red and duller,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Uya, and as the night passed Ugh-lomi fled</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him up the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She tried to see Brother Fire, who guarded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatting-place from beasts, but he was not in sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And far away she heard the mammoths trumpeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they went down to the drinking-place, and once</seg><seg type="columnLine">some huge bulk with heavy paces hurried along,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a noise like a calf, but what it was she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not see. But she thought from the voice it was Yaaa</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rhinoceros, who stabs with his nose, goes always</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, and rages without cause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the little stars began to hide, and then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger ones. It was like all the animals vanishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the Terror. The Sun was coming, lord of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky, as the grizzly was lord of the forest. Eudena</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered what would happen if one star stayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind. And then the sky paled to the dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the daylight came'the fear of lurking things</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed, and she could descend. She was stiff, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so stiff as you would have been, dear young</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady (by virtue of your upbringing), and as she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been trained to eat at least once in three hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but instead had often fasted three days, she did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel uncomfortably hungry. She crept down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree very cautiously, and went her way stealthily</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the wood, and*not a squirrel sprang or deer</seg><seg type="columnLine">started but the terror of the grizzly bear froze her</seg><seg type="columnLine">marrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her desire was now to find her people again. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread of Uya the Cunning was consumed by a greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread of loneliness. But she had lost her direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had run heedlessly overnight, and she could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell whether the squatting-place was sunward or</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it lay. Ever and again she stopped and lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened, and at last, very far awav, she heard a meas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ured chinking. Tt was so faint even in the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">stillness that she could tell it must be far away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But she knew the sound was that of a man sharpen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a flint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently the trees began to thin out, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a regiment of nettles barring the way. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned aside, and then she came to a fallen tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she knew, with a noise of bees about it. And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">so presently she was in sight of the knoll, very far</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, and the rivei under it, and the children and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hippopotami just as they had been yesterday,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the thin spire of smoke swaying in the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze. Far away by the river was the cluster of</seg><seg type="columnLine">alders where she had hidden. And at the sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the fear of Uya returned, and she crept into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thicket of bracken, out of which a rabbit scuttled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lay awhile to watch the squatting-place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE men were mostly out of sight, saving Wau,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flint-chopper; and at that she felt safer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were away hunting food, no doubt. Some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the women, too, were down in the stream, stooping</seg><seg type="columnLine">intent, seeking mussels, crayfish, and water-snails,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at the sight of their occupation Eudena felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry. She rose, and ran through the fern, design-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to join them. As she went she heard a voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the bracken calling softly. She stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then suddenly she hutird a rustle behind her. and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning, saw Ugh-lomi rising out of the fern. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were streaks of brown blood and dirt 011 his face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his eyes were fierce, and the white scone of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uya. the white Fire Stone, that none but Uya dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to touch, was in his hand. In a stride he was beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, and gripped her arm. He swung her about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thrust her before him towards the woods.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Uya," he said, and waved his arms about. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a cry, looked back, and saw all the women</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing up, and two wading out of the stream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then came a nearer howling, and the old woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the beard, who watched the fire on the knoll,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was waving her arms, and Wau. the man who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been chipping the flint, was getting to his feet. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">little children too were hurrying and shouting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come 1" said Ugh-lomi, and dragged her by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She still did not understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Uya has called the death word," said Ugh-lomi,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she glanced back at the screaming curve of fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures, and understood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wau and all the women and children were coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards them, a scattered array of buff shock-headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures, howling, leaping, and crying. Over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knoll two youths hurried. Down among the ferns</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the right came a man, heading them off from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood. Ugh-lomi dropped her arm, and the two began</seg><seg type="columnLine">running side by side, leaping the bracken and step-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping clear and wide. Eudena, knowing her fleetness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the fleetness of Ugh-lomi, laughed aloud at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unequal chase. They were an exceptionally straight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbed couple for those days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They soon cleared the open, and drew near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood of chestnut-trees again--neither afraid now</seg><seg type="columnLine">because neither was alone. They slackened their</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace, already not excessive. And suddenly Eudena</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried and swerved aside, pointing, and looking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the tree-stems. Ugh-lomi saw the feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs of men running towards him. Eudena was</seg><seg type="columnLine">already running off at a tangent. And as he too</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to follow her fliev heard the voice of Uya</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming through the trees, and roaring out his rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">at them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then terror came in their hearts, not the terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">that numbs, but the terror that makes one silent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift. They were cut off now on two sides. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in a sort of corner of pursuit. On the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and near them, came the men swift and heavy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with bearded Uya, antler in hand, leading them; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">730</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the left, scattered as one scatters corn, yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashes among the fern and grass, ran Wau and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women; and even the little children from the shallow</seg><seg type="columnLine">had joined the chase. The two parties converged</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them. Off they went, with Eudena ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They knew there was no mercy for them. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no hunting so sweet to these ancient men as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting of men. Once the tierce passion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chase was lit, the feeble beginnings of humanity in</seg><seg type="columnLine">them were thrown to the winds. And Uya in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night had marked Ugh-lomi with the death word.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ugh-lomi was the day's quarry, the appointed feast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They ran straight--it was their only chance--tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing whatever ground came in the way--a spread of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinging nettles, an open glade, a clump of grass out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which a hya-na lied snarling. Then woods again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">long stretches of shady leaf-mould and moss under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green trunks. Then a stiff slope, tree-clad, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">long vistas of trees, a glade, a succulent green area</seg><seg type="columnLine">of black mud, a wide open space again, and then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clump of lacerating brambles, with beast tracks</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it. Behind them the chase trailed out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered, with Uva ever at their heels. Eudena kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first place, running light and with her breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy, for Ugh-lomi carried the Fire Stone in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It told on his pace--not at first, but after a time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His footsteps behind her suddenly grew remote.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Glancing over her shoulder as they crossed another</seg><seg type="columnLine">open space. Eudena saw that Ugh-lomi was many</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards behind her, and Uya close upon him, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">antler already raised in the air to strike him down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wau and the others were but just emerging from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadow of the woods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seeing Ugh-lomi in peril. Eudena ran sideways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking back, threw up her arms and cried aloud,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as the antler flew. And young Ugh-lomi, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecting this and understanding her cry. ducked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, so that the missile merely struck his scalp</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly, making but a trivial wound, and flew over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He turned forthwith, the quartzite Fire Stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in both hands, and burled it straight at Liya's body</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he ran loose from the throw. Uya shouted, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not dodge it. ll took him under the ribs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy and Hat. and he reeled and went down without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cry. Ugh-lomi caught up the antler--one tine of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was tipped with his own blood--and came running</seg><seg type="columnLine">on again with a red trickle just coming out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Uya rolled over twice, and lay a moment before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he got up, and then he did not run fast. The colour</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his face was changed. Wau overtook him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then others, and lie coughed and laboured in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath. But lie kept on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Al' last the two fugitives gained the bank of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, where the stream ran deep and narrow',</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they still had fifty yards in hand of Wau, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foremost pursuer, the man who made the smiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones. lie carried one. a large flint, the shape of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">oyster and double the size, chipped to a chisel edge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in either hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They sprang down the steep bank into the stream,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed through the water, swam the deep current</seg><seg type="columnLine">in two or three strokes, and came out wading again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dripping and refreshed, to clamber up the farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank. It was undermined, and with willows grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing thickly therefrom, so that it needed clambering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And while Eudena was still among the silvery</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">branches and Ugh-lomi still in the water--for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">antler had encumbered him--Wau came up against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky on the opposite bank, and the smiting stone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown cunningly, took the side of Eudena's knep</seg><seg type="columnLine">She struggled to the top and fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They heard the pursuers shout to one another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ugh-lomi climbing to her and moving jerkily</seg><seg type="columnLine">to mar Wau's aim, felt the second smiting stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">graze his ear, and heard the water splash below him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then it was Ugh-lomi, the stripling, provGl him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to have come to man's estate. For runn.£ig on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found Eudena fell behind, limping, and at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned, and crying savagely and with a face ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible with sudden wrath and trickling blood, ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly past her back to the bank, whirling the antler</seg><seg type="columnLine">round his head. And Eudena kept on, running</seg><seg type="columnLine">stoutly still, though she must needs limp at every</seg><seg type="columnLine">step, and the pain was already sharp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So that Wau, rising over the edge and clinching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the straight willow branches, saw Ugh-lomi tower-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over him, gigantic against the blue; saw his</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole body swing round, and the grip of his Ke'.</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the antler. The edge of the antler came sweep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through the air, and he saw no more. The water</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the osiers whirled and eddied and went crim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son six feet down the stream. Uya following stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">knee-high across the stream, and the man who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">swimming turned about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other men who trailed after--they were none</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them very mighty men (for Uya was more cun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning than strong, brooking no sturdy rivals)--slack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened momentarily at the sight of Ugh-lomi standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">there above the willows, bloody and terrible, betweer</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and the halting girl, with the huge antler wav</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in his hand. It seemed as though he had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the water a youth, and come out of it a man full</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I fe knew what there was behind him. A broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch of grass, and then a thicket, and in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eudena could hide. That was clear in hi- mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though his thinking powers were too feeble to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what should happen thereafter. Uva stood knee-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep, undecided and unarmed. His heavy mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung open, showing his canine teeth, and he panted</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily. His side was flushed and bruised under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair. The other man beside him carried a sharpened</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick. The rest of the hunters came up one by one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the top of the bank, hairy, long-armed men clutch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing (lints and sticks. Two ran off along the hank</seg><seg type="columnLine">down stream, and then clambered to the water, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wau had conic to the surface struggling weakly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before they could reach him he went under again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two others threatened Ugh-lomi from the bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He answered back, shouts, vague insults, gestures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Uya, who had been hesitating, roared with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage, and whirling his fists plunged into the water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ilis followers splashed after him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ugh-lomi glanced over his shoulder and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eudena already vanished into the thicket. Tie would</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps have waited for Uva. but Uya preferred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spar in the water below him until the others were</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside him. Human tactics in those days, in all seri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous fighting, were the tactics of the pack. Prey that</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned at bay they gathered around and rushed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ugh-lomi felt the rush coming, and hurling the antler</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Uya, turned about and fled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he halted to look back from the shadow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thicket, he found only three of his pursuers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed him across the river, and they were going</seg><seg type="columnLine">A STORY OF THE STONE AGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">731</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">back again. Uya, with a bleeding mouth, was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the farther side of the stream again, but lower down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and holding his hand to his side. The others were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the river dragging something to shore. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time at least the chase was intermitted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ugh-lomi stood watching for a space, and snarled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the sight of Uya. Then he turned and plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the thicket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a minute, Eudena came hastening to join him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they went on hand in hand. He dimly per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived the pain she suffered from the cut and bruised</seg><seg type="columnLine">knee, and chose the easier ways. But they went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that day, mile after mile, through wood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thicket, until at last they came to the chalk land,</seg><seg type="columnLine">open grass with rare woods of beech, and the birch</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing near water, and they saw the Wealden</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains nearer, and groups of horses grazing to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether. They went circumspectly, keeping always</seg><seg type="columnLine">near thicket and cover, for this was a strange region</seg><seg type="columnLine">--even its ways were strange. Steadily the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">•rose, until the chestnut forests spread wide and blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">below them, and the Thames marshes shone silvery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">high and far. They saw no men, for in those days</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were still only just come into this part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, and were moving but slowly along the river-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways. Towards evening they came on the river again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but now it ran in a gorge, between high cliffs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">white chalk thdt sometimes overhung it. Down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs was a scrub of birches and there were many</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds there. And high up the cliff was a little shelf</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a tree, whereon they clambered to pass the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY had had scarcely any food; it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time of year for berries, and they had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to go aside to snare or waylay. They tramped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a hungry weary silence, gnawing at twigs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves. But over the surface of the cliffs were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitude of snails, and in a bush were the freshly</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid eggs of a little bird, and then Ugh-lomi threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">at and killed a squirrel in a beech-tree, so that at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last they fed well. Ugh-lomi watched during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, his chin on his knees; and he heard young</seg><seg type="columnLine">foxes crying hard by, and the noise of mammoths</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the gorge and the hyaenas yelling and laughing</seg><seg type="columnLine">far awav. It was chilly, but they dared not light a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. Whenever he dozed, his spirit went abroad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and straightway met with the spirit of Uya, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they fought. And always Ugh-lomi was paralysed</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that he could not smite nor run, and then he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">awake suddenly. Eudena, too, dreamt evil things</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Uva. so that they both awoke with the fear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in their hearts, and by the light of the dawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw a woolly rhinoceros go blundering down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the day they caressed one another and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were glad of the sunshine, and Ettdena's leg was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff sbe sat on the ledge all day. Ugh-lomi found</seg><seg type="columnLine">great flints sticking out of the cliff face, greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any he had seen, and he dragged some to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge and began chipping,- so as to be armed against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uya, when he came again. And at one he laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">heartily, and Eudena laughed, and they threw it</seg><seg type="columnLine">about in derision. It had a hole in it. They stuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fingers through it, it was very funny indeed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then they peeped at one another through it. After-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards, Ugh-lomi got himself a stick, and thrusting</seg><seg type="columnLine">by chance at this foolish flint, the stick went in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck there. He had rammed it in too tightly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">withdraw it. That was still stranger--scarcely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">funny, terrible almost, and for a tiwie Ugh-lomi did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not greatly care to touch the thing. It was as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flint bad bit and held with its teeth. But then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he got familiar with the odd combination. He swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">it about, and perceived that the stick with the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone on the end struck a better blow than anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew. He went to and fro swinging it, and strik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with it; but later he tired of it and threw it</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside. In the afternoon he went up over the brow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the white cliff, and lay watching by a rabbit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">warren until the rabbits came out to play. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no men thereabouts, and the rabbits were heed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less. He threw a smiting stone he had made and</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a kill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night they made a fire from flint sparks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bracken fronds, and talked and caressed by it. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their sleep Uya's spirit came again, and suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Ugh-lomi was trying to fight vainly, the fool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish flint 011 the stick came into bis hand, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck Uya with it, and behold! it killed him. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterwards came other dreams of Uya--for spirits</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a lot of killing, and he had to be killed again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then after that the stone would not keep on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick. He awoke tired and rather gloomy, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulky all the forenoon, in spite of Eudena's kind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liness, and instead of hunting he sat chipping a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp edge to the singular flint, and looking strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her. Then he bound the perforated flint on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stick with strips of rabbit skin. And afterwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">he walked up and down the ledge, striking with it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and muttering to himself, and thinking of Uya. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt very fine and heavy in the hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several days, more than there was any counting</seg><seg type="columnLine">in those days, five days, it may be, or six, did Ugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lomi and Eudena stay on that shelf in the gorge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, and they lost all fear of men, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire burnt redly of a night. And they were very</seg><seg type="columnLine">merry together; there was food every day, sweet</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, and no enemies. Eudena's knee was well in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a couple of days, for those ancient savages had</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick-healing flesh. Indeed, they were very happy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On one of those days Ugh-lomi dropped a chunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flint over the cliff. He saw it fall, and go bound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing across the river bank into the river, and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing and thinking it over a little he tried another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This smashed a bush of hazel in the most interest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing way. They spent all the morning dropping stones</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ledge, and in the afternoon they discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">this new and interesting pastime was also possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the cliff brow. The next day they had for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten this delight. Or at least, it seemed they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT Uya came in dreams to spoil the paradise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three nights he came fighting Ugh-lomi. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning after these dreams Ugh-lomi would</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk up and down, threatening him and swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">the axe, and at last came the night after Ugh-lomi</seg><seg type="columnLine">brained the otter, and they had feasted. Uya went</seg><seg type="columnLine">too far. Ugh-lomi awoke, scowling under his heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">brows, and he took his axe, and extending his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards Eudena he bade her wait for him upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge. Then he clambered down the white declivity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced up once from the foot of it and flourished</seg><seg type="columnLine">his axe. and without looking back again went strid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing along the river bank until the overhanging cliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the bend hid him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two days and nights did Eudena sit alone by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire on the ledge waiting, and in the night the beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">732</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">howled over the cliffs and down the valley, and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliff over against her the hunched hyaenas prowled</seg><seg type="columnLine">black against the sky. But no evil thing came near</seg><seg type="columnLine">her save fear. Once, far away, she heard the roar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of a lion, following the horses as they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">northward over the grass lands with the spring. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time she waited--the waiting that is pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the third day Ugh-lomi came hack, up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. The plumes of a raven were in his hair. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first axe was red-stained, and had long dark hairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it, and he carried the necklace that had marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the favourite of Uya in his hand, lie walked in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft places, giving no heed to his trail. Save a raw</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut below his jaw there was not a wound upon him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Uya!" cried Ugh-lomi exultant, and Eudena saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was well. lie put the necklace on Eudena, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they ate and drank together. And after eating he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to rehearse the whole storv from the begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning, when Uya had cast his eyes on Eudena, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uya and Ugh-lomi. fighting in the forest, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">chased by the bear, eking out his scanty words with</seg><seg type="columnLine">abundant pantomime, springing to his feet and whirl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the stone axe round when it came to the fighting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The last fight was a mighty one, stamping and hout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and once a blow at the fire that sent a torrent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sparks up into the night. And Eudena sat red</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the light of the fire, gloating on him, her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">flushed and her eyes shining, and the necklace Uya</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made about her neck. It was a splendid time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the stars that looked down on us looked down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her. our ancestor--who has been dead now these</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty thousand years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Cave Bear</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the days when Eudena and Ugh-lomi fled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the people of Uya towards the fir-clad</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains of the Weald, across the forests of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet chestnut and the grass-clad chalk land, and hid</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves at last in the gorge of the river between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chalk cliffs, men were few and their squatting -</seg><seg type="columnLine">places far between. The nearest men to them were</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of the tribe, a full day's journey down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, and up the mountains there were none. Man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was indeed a newcomer to this part of the world in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ancient time, coming slowly along the rivers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">generation after generation, from one squatting-place</seg><seg type="columnLine">to another, from the south-westward. And the ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals that held the land, the hippopotamus and rhi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noceros of the river valleys, the horses of the grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">plains, the deer and swine of the woods, the grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">apes in the branches, the cattle of the uplands, feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">him but little--let alone the mammoths in the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains and the elephants that came through the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the summer-time out of the south. For why</seg><seg type="columnLine">should they fear him. with but the rough, chipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">flints that he had not learnt to haft and which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw but ill. and the poor spear of sharpened wood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as all the weapons he had against hoof and horn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tooth and claw ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Andoo, the huge cave bear, who lived in the cave</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the gorge, had never even seen a man in all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise and respectable life, until midway through one</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, as he was prowling down the gorge along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff edge, he saw the glare of F.udena's fire upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ledge, and Eudena red and shining, and Ugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lomi, with a gigantic shadow mocking him upon the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">white cliff, going to and fro. shaking his mane of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair, and waving the axe of stone--the first axe of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone--while he chanted of the killing of Uya. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave bear was far up the gorge, and he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing slanting-ways and far off. He was so sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised he stood quite still upon the edge, sniffing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the novel odour of burning bracken, and wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether the dawn was coming up in the wrong place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was the lord of the rocks and caves, was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave bear, as his slighter brother, the grizzly, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lord of the thick woods below, and as the dappled</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion--the lion of those days was dappled--was lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the thorn-thickets, reedbeds, and open plains.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was the greatest of all meat-eaters; he knew no</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear, none preyed on him, and none gave him battle;</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the rhinoceros was beyond his strength. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mammoth shunned his country. This invasion</seg><seg type="columnLine">perplexed him. He noticed these new beasts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped like monkeys, and sparsely hairy like young</seg><seg type="columnLine">pigs. "Monkey and young pig." said the cave bear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It might not be so bad.

A couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hysenas also were so intent upon the thing helow</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Andoo, coming soft and easy, was close upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them before they knew of him or he of them. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">started guiltily and went lurching off. Coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">round in a wheel, a hundred yards off, they began</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelling and calling him names to revenge themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the start they had had. "Ya-ha!" they cricd.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who can't grub his own burrows? Who eats roots</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a pig? . . .

He was very curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous, was the cave bear, more curious than any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bears that live now, and the flickering fire and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the incomprehensible movements of the man, let alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intrusion into his indisputable province, stirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with a sense of strange new happenings. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been after red deer fawn that night, fo- the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave bear was a miscellaneous hunter, but this quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned him from that enterprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ya-ha!" yelled the bvaenas behind.

Far away</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the open space beyond where the heavy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldered, lean-bodied hyaenas blundered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">howled, was a beech-wood, and the mountain slopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose beyond, a dim mystery, until their snow-capped</seg><seg type="columnLine">summits came out white and cold and clear, touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the first rays of the yet unseen moon. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast silence, save when the yell of the hyaenas flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vanishing discordance across its peace, or when</seg><seg type="columnLine">from down the hills the trumpeting of the new-come</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephants came faintly on the faint breeze. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">below now, the red flicker had dwindled and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady, and shone a deeper red, and Ugh-lomi had</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished his story and was preparing to sleep, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eudena sat and listened to the strange voices of</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown beasts, and watched the dark eastern sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing deeply luminous at the advent of the moon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down below, the river talked to itself, and things</seg><seg type="columnLine">unseen went to and fro.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a time the bear went away, but in an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was back again. Then, as if struck by a thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned, and went up the gorge. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE night passed, and Ugh-lomi slept on. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">waning moon rose and lit the gaunt white cliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead with a light that was pale and vague. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorge remained, in a deeper shadow and seemed all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darker. Then by imperceptible degrees, the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">came stealing in the wake of the moonlight. Eude-</seg><seg type="columnLine">na's eyes wandered to the cliff brow overhead once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then again. Each time the line was sharp and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear against the sky. and yet she had a dim percep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of something lurking there. The red of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire grew deeper and deeper, grey scales spread upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, its vertical column of smoke became more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more visible, and up and down the gorge things that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad been unseen grew clear in a colourless illumina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. She may have dozed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly she started up from her squatting posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, erect and alert, scrutinising the cliff up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She made the faintest sound, and Ugh-lomi too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-sleeping like an animal, was instantly awake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He caught up his axe and came noiselessly to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The light was still dim, the world now all in black</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dark grev, and one sickly star still lingered over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. The iedge they were on was a little grassy</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, six feet wide, perhaps, and twenty feet long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sloping outwardly, and with a handful of St. John's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wort growing near the edge. Below it the soft, white</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock fell away in a steep slope of nearly fifty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the thick bush of hazel that fringed the river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down the river this slope increased, until some way</seg><seg type="columnLine">off a thin grass held its own right up to the crest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliff. Overhead, forty or fifty feet of rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulged into the great masses characteristic of chalk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but at the end of the ledge a gully, a precipitous</seg><seg type="columnLine">groove of discoloured rock, slashed the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff, and gave a footing to a scrubby growth, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Eudena and Ugh-lomi went up and down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They stood as noiseless as startled deer, with every</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense expectant.

And forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">with, with a sudden contraction of the heart, he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cave bear half-\vay down from the brow, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a gingerly backward step with his flat hind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot. His hind-quarters were towards Ugh-lomi,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he clawed at the rocks and bushes so that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed flattened against the cliff. He looked none</seg><seg type="columnLine">the less for that. From his shining snout to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumpy tail he was a lion and a half, the length of</seg><seg type="columnLine">two tall men. He looked over his shoulder, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bis huge mouth was open with the exertion of hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up his great carcass, and his tongue lay out. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He got his footing, and came down slowly, a yard</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bear," said Ugh-lomi, looking round with bis</seg><seg type="columnLine">face white.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Eudena, with terror in her eyes, was pointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the cliff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ugh-lomi's mouth fell open. For down below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her big fore-feet against the rock, stood another</seg><seg type="columnLine">big brown-grey bulk--the she-bear. She was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">so big as Andoo, but she was big enough for all that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly Ugh-lomi gave a cry, and catching</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a handful of the litter of ferns that lav scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ledge, he thrust it into the pallid ash of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. "Brother Fire !" he cried, "Brother Fire !" And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eudena, starting into activity, did likewise. "Brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fire ! Help, help !

"Brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fire!" they screamed. But he whispered and passed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was nothing but ashes. Then Ugh-lomi</seg><seg type="columnLine">danced with anger and struck the ashes with his fist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Eudena began to hammer the firestone against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flint. And the eyes of each were turning ever and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again towards the gully by which Andoo was climb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down. Brother Fire!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SUDDENLY the huge furry hind-quarters of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear came into view, beneath the bulge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chalk that had hidden him. He was still clambering</seg><seg type="columnLine">gingerly down the nearly vertical surface. His head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was yet out of sight, but they could hear him talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to himself. "Pig and monkey," said the cave</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear. "It ought to be good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eudena struck a spark and blew at it; it twinkled</seg><seg type="columnLine">brighter and then--went out. At that she cast down</seg><seg type="columnLine">flint and firestone and stared blankly. Then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang to ner feet and scrambled a yard or so up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clift above the ledge. How she hung on even</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment I do not know, for the chalk was</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertical and without grip for a monkey. In a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of seconds she had slid back to the ledge again with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleeding bands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ugh-lomi was making frantic rushes about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge--now he would go to the edge, now to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gullv. He did not know what to do. he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">think. The she-bear looked smaller than her mate--</seg><seg type="columnLine">much. Tf they rushed down on her together, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">might live. "Ugh ?" said the cave bear, and Ugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lomi turned again and saw his little eyes peering</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the bulge of the chalk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eudena, cowering at the end of the ledge, began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to scream like a gripped rabbit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that a sort of madness came upon Ugh-lomi.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a mighty cry, he caught up his axe and ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards Andoo. The monster gave a grunt of sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise. In a moment Ugh-lomi was clinging to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bush rigtV underneath the bear, and in another he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hangup to its back half buried in fur, with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist clutched in the hair under its jaw. The bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too astonished at this fantastic attack to do more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than cling passive. And then the axe, the first of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all axes, rang on its skull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bear's head twisted from side to side, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he began a petulant scolding growl. The axe bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">within an inch of the left eye, and the hot blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinded that side. At that the brute roared with</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise and anger, and his teeth gnashed six inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Ugh-lomi's face. Then the axe, clubbed close,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came down heavily on the corner of the jaw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next blow blinded the right side and called</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth a roar, this time of pain. Eudena saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge, flat feet slipping and sliding, and suddenly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear gave a clumsy leap sideways, as if for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge. Then everything vanished, and the hazels</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed, and a roar of pain and a tumult of shouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and growls came up from far below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eudena screamed and ran to the edge and peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. For a moment, man and bears were a heap</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, Ugh-lomi uppermost; and then he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprung clear and was scaling the gully again, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bears rolling and striking at one another among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hazels. But lie had left his axe below, and three</seg><seg type="columnLine">knob-ended streaks of carmine were shooting down</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thigh. "Up!" he cried, and in a moment Eu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dena was leading the way to the top of the cliff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In half a minute they were at the crest, their hearts</seg><seg type="columnLine">pumping noisily, with Andoo and his wife far and</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe below them. Andoo was sitting on his haunches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">both paws at work, trying with quick exasperated</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements to wipe the blindness out of his eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the she-bear stood on all-fours a little way off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruffled in appearance and growling angrily. Ugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lomi flung himself flat on the grass, and lay panting</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bleeding with his face on his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a second Eudena regarded the bears, then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">came and sat beside him, looking at him. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently she put forth her hand timidly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched him. and made the guttural sound that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">his name. He turned over and raised himself on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm. His face was pale, like the face of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who is afraid. He looked at her steadfastly for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, and then suddenly he laughed. "Waugh!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said exultantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Waugh!" said she--a simple but expressive con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Ugh-lomi came and knelt beside her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on hands and knees peered over the brow and exam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ined the gorge. His breath was steady now, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood on his leg had ceased to flow, though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratches the she-bear had made were open and wide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He squatted up and sat staring at the footmarks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great bear as they came to the gullv--they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">as wide as his head and twice as long. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped up and went along the cliff face until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge was visible. Here he sat down for some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking, while Eudena watched him. Presently she</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the bears had gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last Ugh-lomi rose, as one whose mind is made</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. He returned towards the gully. Eudena keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">close by him, and together they clambered to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge. They took the firestone and a flint, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ugh-lomi went down to the foot of the cliff very</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously, and found his axe. They returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliff as quietly as they could, and set off at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brisk walk. The ledge was a home no longer, with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">such callers in the neighbourhood. Ugh-lomi car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried the axe and Eudena the firestone. So simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a Palaeolithic removal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY went up-stream, although it might lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the very lair of the cave bear, because there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no other way to go. Down the stream was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe, and had not Ugh-lomi killed Uya and Wau ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">By the stream they had to keep--because of drinking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So they marched through beech trees, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorge deepening until the river flowed, a frothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid, five hundred feet below them. Of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">changeful things in this world of change, the courses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rivers in deep valleys change least. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river Wey, the river we know to-day, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">marched over the very spots where nowadays stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">little Guildford and Godalming -- the first human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings to come into the land. Once a grey ape chat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered and vanished, and all along the cliff edge, vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even, ran the spoor of the great cave bear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then the spoor of the bear fell away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff, showing, Ugh-lomi thought, that he came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">some place to the left, and keeping to the cliff's edge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they presently came to an end. They found them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves looking down 011 a great semi-circular space</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused by the collapse of the cliff. It had smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">right across the gorge, banking the up-stream water</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in a pool which overflowed in a rapid. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">slip had happened long ago. It was grassed over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the face of the cliffs that stood about the semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle was still almost fresh-looking and white as</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the day when the rock must have broken and slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. Starkly exposed and black under the foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these cliffs were the mouths of several caves. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they stood there, looking at the space, and disin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clined to skirt it, because they thought the bears'</seg><seg type="columnLine">lair lay somewhere on the left in the direction they</seg><seg type="columnLine">must needs take, they saw suddenly first one bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then two coming up the grass slope to the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and going across the amphitheatre towards the caves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andoo was first; he dropped a little on his fore-foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his mien was despondent, and the she-bear came</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuffling behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eudena and Ugh-lomi stepped back from the cliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they could just see the bears over the verge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Ugh-lomi stopped. Eudena pulled his arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he turned with a forbidding gesture, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand dropped. Ugh-lomi stood watching the bears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his axe in his hand, until they had vanished into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cave. He growled softly, and shook the axe at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the she-bear's receding quarters. Then to Eudena's</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror, instead of creeping off with her, he lav flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and crawled forward into such a position that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could just see the cave. It was bears--and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did it as calmly as if it had been rabbits he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lay still, like a barked log, sun-dappled, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadow of the trees. He was thinking. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eudena had learnt, even when a little girl, that when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ugh-lomi became still like that, jawbone on fist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">novel things presently began to happen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an hour before the thinking was over; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was noon when the two little savages had found</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way to the cliff brow that overhung the bears'</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave. And all the long afternoon they fought des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perately with a great boulder of chalk; trundling it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with nothing but their unaided sturdy muscles, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gully where it had hung like a loose tooth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the cliff top. It was full two yards about</seg><seg type="columnLine">A STORY OF THE STONE AGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">735</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it stood as high as Eudena's waist, it was obtuse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">angled and toothed with flints. And when the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">set it was poised, three inches from the edge, above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cave of the great cave bear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the cave conversation languished during that</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon. The she-bear snoozed sulkily in her cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner--for she was fond of pig and monkey--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andoo was busy licking the side of his paw and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smearing his face to cool the smart and inflamma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of his wounds. Afterwards he went and sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">just within the mouth of the cave, blinking out at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the afternoon sun with his uninjured eye, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I never was so startled in my life," he said at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last. "They are the most extraordinary beasts. At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacking me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't like them," said the she-bear, out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A feebler sort of beast I never saw. I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">think what the world is coming to. Scraggy, weedy</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs. . . . Wonder how they keep warm in winter?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Very likely they don't," said the she-bear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose it's a sort of monkey gone wrong."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a change,'' said the she-bear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A pause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The advantage he had was merely accidental,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Andoo. "These things will happen at times."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't understand why you let go," said the she-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT matter had been discussed before, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled. So Andoo, being a bear of experience,</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained silent for a space. Then he resumed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a different aspect of the matter. "He has a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">claw--a long claw that he seemed to have first on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one paw and then on the other. Just one claw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They're very odd things. The bright thing, too, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have--like that glare that comes in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky in daytime--only it jumps about--it's really</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth seeing. It's a thing with a root, too--like grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it is windy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Does it bite?" asked the she-bear. "Tf it bites</seg><seg type="columnLine">it can't be a plant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--I don't know," said Andoo. "Rut it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious, anyhow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder if they arc good eating?" said the she-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They look it," said Andoo, with appetite--for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cave bear, like the polar bear, was an incurable</seg><seg type="columnLine">carnivore--no roots or honey for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two bears fell into a meditation for a space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Andoo resumed his simple attentions to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye. The sunlight up the green slope before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave mouth grew warmer in tone and warmer, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a ruddy amber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Curious sort of thing--day," said the cave bear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lot too much of it, T think. Quite unsuitable for</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting. Dazzles me always. I can't smell nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">so well by day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The she-bear did not answer, but there came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">measured crunching sound out of the darkness. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had turned up a bone. Andoo yawned. "Well." he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. He strolled to the cave mouth and stood with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head projecting, surveying the amphitheatre. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">found he had to turn his head completely round to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see objects on his right-hand side. No doubt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye would be all right to-morrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He yawned again. There was a tap overhead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a big mass of chalk flew out from the cliff face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped a yard in front of his nose, antt starred</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a dozen unequal fragments. It startled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he had recovered a little from his shock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went and sniffed curiously at the representative</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces of the fallen projectile. They had a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinctive flavour, oddly reminiscent of the two drab</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals of the ledge. He sat up and pawed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger lump, and walked round it several times, try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to find a man about it somewhere. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When night had come he went off down the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorge to see if he could cut off either of the ledge's</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupants. The ledge was empty, there were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs of the red thing, but as he was rather hungry</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not loiter long that night, but pushed on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick up a red deer fawn. He forgot about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drab animals. He found a fawn, but the doe was</seg><seg type="columnLine">close by and made an ugly fight for her young.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andoo had to leave the fawn, but as her blood was</seg><seg type="columnLine">up she stuck to the attack, and at last he got in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow of his paw on her nose, and so got hold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. More meat but less delicacy, and the she-bear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">following, had her share. The next afternoon, curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously enough, the very fellow of the first white rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell, and smashed precisely according to precedent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The aim of the third, that fell the night after,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, was better. It hit Andoo's unspeculative</seg><seg type="columnLine">skull with a crack that echoed up the cliff, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white fragments went dancing to all the points of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the compass. The she-bear coming after him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sniffing. curiously at him. found him lying in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd sort of attitude, with his head wet and all out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shape. She was a young she-bear, and inexperi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enced, and having sniffed about him for some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">and licked him a little, and so forth, she decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave him until the odd mood had passed, and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her hunting alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked up the fawn of the red doe they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed two nights ago, and found it. But it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonely hunting without Andoo, and she returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">caveward before dawn. The sky was grey and over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast, the trees up the gorge were black and unfamil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iar, and into her ursine mind came a dim sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange and dreary happenings. She lifted up her</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice and called Andoo bv name. The sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorge reechoed her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As she approached the caves she saw in the half</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, and heard a couple of jackals scuttle off, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately after a hyaena howled and a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">clumsy bulks went lumbering up the slope, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped and yelled derision. "Lord of the rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and caves--ya-ha!" came down the wind. The dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal feeling in the she-bear's mind became suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">acute. She shuffled across the amphitheatre.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ya-ha!" said the hysenas, retreating. "Ya-ha!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cave bear was not lying quite in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitude, because the hyaenas had been busy, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one place bis ribs showed white. Dotted over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">turf about him lay the smashed fragments of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three great lumps of chalk. And the air was full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the scent of death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The she-bear stopped dead. Even now, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great and wonderful Andoo was killed was beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">her believing. Then she heard far overhead a sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a queer sound, a little like the shout of a hyaena but</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuller and lower in pitch. She looked up, her little</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn-blinded eyes seeing little, her nostrils quiver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. And there, on the cliff edge, far above her</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the bright pink of dawn, were two little</seg><seg type="columnLine">736</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shaggy round dark tilings, the heads of Eudena and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ugh-lomi, as they shouted derision at her. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">though she could not see them very distinctly she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear, and dimly she began to apprehend. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">novel feeling as of imminent strange evils came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">her heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She began to examine the smashed fragments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chalk that lay about Andoo. For a space she stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">still, looking about her and making a low continu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous sound that was almost a mOui. Then she went</seg><seg type="columnLine">back incredulously to Andoo to make one last effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rouse him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The First Horseman</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the days before Ugh-lomi there was little</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble between the horses and men. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived apart--the men in the river swamps and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickets, the horses on the wide grassy uplands be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the chestnuts and the pines. Sometimes a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pony would come straying into the clogging marshes</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make a Hint-hacked meal, and sometimes the tribe</seg><seg type="columnLine">would find one, the kill of a lion, and drive off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jackals, and feast heartily while the sun was high.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These horses of the old time were clumsy at the fet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock and dun-coloured, with a rough tail and big</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. They came every spring-time north-westward</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the country, after the swallows ami before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hippopotami, as the grass on the wide downland</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretclies grew long. They came only in small bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus far, each herd, a stallion and two or three mares</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a foal or so, having its own stretch of country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they went again when the chestnut-trees were</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow and the wolves came down the Wealden</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was their custom to graze right out in the open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">going into cover only in the heat of the day. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoided the long stretches of thorn and beechwood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">preferring an isolated group of trees void of ambus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cade, so that it was bard to come upon them. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were never fighters; their heels and teeth were for</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another, but in the clear country, once they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">started, no living thing came near them, though per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps the elephant might have done so had he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the need. And in those days man seemed a harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less thing enough. No whisper of prophetic intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence told the species of the terrible slavery that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to come, of the whip and spur and bearing-rein,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clumsy load and the slippery street, the insuffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient food, and the knacker's yard, that was to replace</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wide grass-land and the freedom of the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down in the Wev marshes Ugh-lomi and Eudena</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never seen the horses closely, but now they saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them every day as the two of them raided out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lair on the ledge in the gorge, raiding together</seg><seg type="columnLine">in search of food. They had returned to the ledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the killing of Andoo; for of the she-bear they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not afraid. The she-bear had become afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, and when she winded them she went aside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two went together everywhere; for since they</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the tribe Eudena was not so much Ugh-lomi's</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman as his mate; she learnt to hunt even--as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much, that is, as any woman could. She was indeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a marvellous woman. He would lie for hours watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a beast, or planning catches in that shock head</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of his, and she would stay beside him, with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright eyes upon him, offering no irritating sugges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions--as still as any man. A wonderful woman!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the top of the cliff was an open grassy lawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then beechwoods, and going through the beech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods one came to the edge of the rolling grassy</seg><seg type="columnLine">expanse, and in sight of the horses. Here, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the wood and bracken, were the rabbit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burrows, and here among the fronds Eudena and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ugh-lomi would lie with their throwing-stones ready,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the little people came out to nibble and play</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sunset. And while Eudena would sit, a silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure of watchfulness, regarding the burrows, Ugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lomi's eyes were ever away across the greensward</seg><seg type="columnLine">at those wonderful grazing strangers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In a dim way he appreciated their grace and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">supple nimbleness. As the sun declined in the eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning-time, and the heat of the day passed, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would become active, would start chasing one an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, neighing, dodging, shaking their manes, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing round in great curves, sometimes so close that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pounding of the turf sounded like hurried thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der. It looked so fine that Ugh-lomi wanted to join</seg><seg type="columnLine">in badly. And sometimes one would roll over on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the turf, kicking four hoofs heavenward, -which</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed formidable and was certainly much less al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dim imaginings ran through Ugh-lomi's mind as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he watched--by virtue of which two rabbits lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">the longer. And sleeping, his brains were clearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bolder--for that was the way in those days. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">came near the horses, he dreamt, and fought, smit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-s^yne against hoof, but then the horses changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to men. or, at least, to men with horses' heads, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he awoke in a cold sweat of terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet the next day in the morning, as the horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">were grazing, one of the mares whinnied, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Ugh-lomi coming tip the wind. They all stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">their eating and watched him. Ugh-lomi was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming towards them, but strolling obliquely across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open, looking at anything in the world but</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses. He had stuck three fern-fronds into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mat of his hair, giving him a remarkable appearance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he walked very slowly. "What's up now?" said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Master Horse, who was capable, but inexper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ienced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It looks more like the first half of an animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">than anything else in the world," he said, "Fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs and no hind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It's only one of those pink monkey things," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Eldest Mare. "They're a sort of river monkey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They're quite common on the plains." •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ugh-lomi continued his oblique advance. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eldest Mare was struck with the want of motive in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his proceedings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Fool!" said the Eldest Mare, in a quick conclusive</seg><seg type="columnLine">way she had. She resumed her grazing. The Mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter Horse and the Second Mare followed suit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Look! he's nearer," said the Foal with a Stripe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the younger foals made uneasy move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments. Ugh-lomi squatted down, and sat regarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horses fixedly. In a little while he was satisfied</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they meant neither flight nor hostilities. He be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to consider bis next procedure. He did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel anxious to kill, but he had his axe with him. and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spirit of sport was upon him. How would one</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill one of these creatures?--these great beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures!</seg><seg type="columnLine">A STORY OF THE STONE AGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">737</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EUDENA, watching him with a fearful admira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion from the cover of the bracken, saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently go 011 all fours, and so proceed again. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horses preferred him a biped to a quadruped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Master Horse threw up his head and gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the word to move. Ugh-lomi thought they were off</seg><seg type="columnLine">for good, but after a minute's gallop they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">round in a wide curve, and stood winding him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, as a rise in the ground hid him, they tailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, the Master Horse leading, and approached him</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was as ignorant of the possibilities of a horse as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were of his. And at this stage it would seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">he funked, lie knew this kind of stalking would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make red deer or buffalo charge, if it were persisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. At any rate Eudena saw him jump up and come</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking towards her with the fern plumes held in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stood up, and he grinned to show that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole thing was an immense lark, and that what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done was just what he had planned to do from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very beginning. So that incident ended. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was very thoughtful all that day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day this foolish drab creature with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leonine mane, instead of going about the grazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">or hunting he was .made for, was prowling round</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horses again. The Eldest Mare was all for</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent contempt. "I suppose he wants to learn some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing from us," she said, and "Lei him." The next</seg><seg type="columnLine">day lie was at it again. The Master Horse decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">he meant absolutely nothing. But as a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact. Ugh-lomi, the first of men to feel that curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">spell of the horse that binds us even to this day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant a great deal. He admired them unreservedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a rudiment of the snob in him, I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid, and he wanted to be near tlr*se beautifully-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curved animals. Then there were vague concep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of a kill. If only they would let him come</seg><seg type="columnLine">near them! But they drew the line, he found, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty yards. If he came nearer than that they moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">off--with dignity. I suppose it was the way he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinded Andoo that made him think of leaping 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back of one of them. But though Eudena after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time came out in the open too, and they did some</seg><seg type="columnLine">unobtrusive stalking things stopped there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then one memorable day a new idea came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ugh-lomi. The horse looks down and level, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">does not '00k up. No animals look up--they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much common-sense. It was only that fantastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">rreature, man, could waste his wits skyward. Ugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lomi made no philosophical deductions, but he per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived the thing was so. So he spent a weary day</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a beech that stood in the open, while Eudena</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalked. Usually the horses went into the shade in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heat of the afternoon, but that day the skv was</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcast, and they would not. in spite of Eudena's</seg><seg type="columnLine">solicitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was two days later that Ugh-lomi had his de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">s'ire. The day was blazing hot, and the multiplying</seg><seg type="columnLine">flies asserted themselves. The horses stopped graz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing before mid-day, and came into the shadow below</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. and stood in couples nose to tail, flapping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Master Horse, by virtue of his heels, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">closest to the tree. And suddenly there was a rustle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a creak, a thud. . . . Then a sharp chipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">flint bit him 011 the cheek. The Master Horse stum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled, came on one knee, rose to his feet, and was off</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the wind. The air was full of the whirl of limbs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prance of hoofs, and snorts of alarm. Ugh-lomi</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was pitched a foot in the air, came down again, up</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, his stomach was hit violently, and then his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees got a grip of something between them. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself clutching with knees, feet, and hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">careering violently with extraordinary oscillation</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air--his axe gone heaven knows whither.</seg><seg type="columnLine">''Hold tight," said Mother Instinct, and he did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was aware of a lot of coarse hair in his face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of it between his teeth, and of green turf</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaming past in front of his eyes. He saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder of the Master Horse, vast and sleek, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles flowing swiftly under the skin. He perceived</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his arms were round the neck, and that the vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent jerkings he experienced had a sort of rhythm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he was in the midst of a wild rush of tree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stems, and then there were fronds of bracken about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then more open turf. Then a stream of peb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bles rushing past, little pebbles flying sideways</seg><seg type="columnLine">athwart the stream from the blow of the swift hoofs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ugh-lomi began to feel frightfully sick and giddy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he was not the stuff to leave go simply because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was uncomfortable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dared not leave his grip, but he tried to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself more comfortable. He released his bug on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the neck, gripping the mane instead. He slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knees forward, and pushing back, came into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting position where the quarters broaden. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous work, but he managed it, and at last he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly seated astride, breathless indeed, and uncer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain. but with that frightful pounding of his body at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any rate relieved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SLOWLY the fragments of Ugh-lomi's mind got</seg><seg type="columnLine">into order again. The pace seemed to him ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rific, but a kind of exultation was beginning to oust</seg><seg type="columnLine">his first frantic terror. The air rushed by, sweet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wonderful, the rhythm of the hoofs changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and broke up and returned into itself again. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were 011 turf now, a wide glade--the beech-trees a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards away on either side, and a succulent</seg><seg type="columnLine">band of green starred with pink blossom and shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">with silver water here and there, meandered down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle. Far off was a glimpse of blue valley--</seg><seg type="columnLine">far away. The exultation grew. It was man's first</seg><seg type="columnLine">taste of pace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came a wide space dappled with flying fal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low deer scattering this way and that, and then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of jackals, mistaking Ugh-lomi for a lion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came hurrying after him. And when they saw it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a lion they still came 011 out of curiosity. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">galloped the horse, with his one idea of escape, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">after him the jackals, with pricked ears and quickly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barked remarks. "Which kills which?" said the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">jackal. "It's the horse being killed," said the second.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They gave the howl of following, and the horse an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered to it as a horse answers nowadays to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On they rushed, a little tornado through the quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, putting up startled birds, sending a dozen un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected things darting to cover, raising a myriad</seg><seg type="columnLine">of indignant dung-flies, smashing little blossoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">(lowering complacently, back into their parental turf.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trees again, and then splash, splash across a torrent;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a hare shot out of a tuft of grass under the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoofs of the Master Horse, and the jackals left them</seg><seg type="columnLine">incontinently. So presently they broke into the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, a wide expanse of turfy hillside--the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">grassy downs that fall northward nowadays from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Epsom Stand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">738</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first hot bolt of the Master Horse was long</seg><seg type="columnLine">since over. He was falling into a measured trot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ugh-lomi, albeit bruised exceedingly and quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertain of the future, was in a state of glorious</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoyment. And now came a new development. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace broke again, the Master Horse came round on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short curve, and stopped dead. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ugh-lomi became alert. He wished he had a flint,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the throwing flint he had carried in a thong</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his waist was--like the axe--heaven knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">where. The Master Horse turned his head, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ugh-lomi became aware of an eye and teeth. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped his leg into a position of security, and hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the cheek with his fist. Then the head went down</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere out of existence apparently, and the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was sitting on flew up into a dome. Ugh-lomi</seg><seg type="columnLine">became a thing of instinct again--strictly prehen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible; he held by knees and feet, and his head seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliding towards the turf. His fingers were twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the shock of mane, and the rough hair of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse saved him. The gradient he was on lowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and then--"Whup!" said Ugh-lomi aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished, and the slant was the other way up. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ugh-lomi was a thousand generations nearer the</seg><seg type="columnLine">primordial than man: no monkey could have held</seg><seg type="columnLine">on better. And the lion had been training the horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">for countless generations against the tactics of roll-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and rearing back. But he kicked like a master,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and buck-jumped rather neatly. In five minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ugh-lomi lived a lifetime. If he came off, the horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">would kill him, he felt assured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the Master Horse decided to stick to his old</seg><seg type="columnLine">tactics again, and suddenly went off at a gallop. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed down the slope, taking the steep places at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush, swerving neither to the right nor to the left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, as they rode down, the wide expanse of valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank out of sight behind the approaching skirmishers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of oak and hawthorn. They skirted a sudden hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the pool of a spring, rank weeds and silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes. The ground grew softer and the grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">taller, and on the right-hand side and the left came</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered bushes of May--still splashed with belated</seg><seg type="columnLine">blossom. Presently the bushes thickened until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashed the passing rider, and little flashes and gouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blood came out on horse and man. Then the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AND then came a wonderful adventure. A sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ii den squeal of unreasonable anger rose amidst</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bushes, the squeal of some creature bitterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">wronged. And crashing after them appeared a big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grev-blue shape. It was Yaaa the big-horned rhinoc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eros, in one of those fits of fury of his, charging</seg><seg type="columnLine">full tilt, after the manner of his kind. He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled at his feeding, and someone, it did not mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter who, was to be ripped and trampled therefore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was bearing down 011 them from the left, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wicked little eye red, his great horn down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tail like a jury-mast behind him. For a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ugh-lomi was minded to slip off and dodge, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then behold! the staccato of the hoofs grew swifter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the rhinoceros and his stumpy hurrying little</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs seemed to slide out at the back corner of Ugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lomi's eye. In two minutes they were through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes of May. and out in the open, going fast. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a space he could hear the ponderous paces in pursuit</seg><seg type="columnLine">receding behind him, and then it was just as if Yaaa</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not lost his temper, as if Yaaa had never existed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pace never faltered, on they rode and on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ugh-lomi was now all exultation. To exult in</seg><seg type="columnLine">those days was to insult. "Ya-ha! big nose!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, trying to crane back and see some remote speck</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a pursuer. "Why don't you carry your smiting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone in your fist?'' he ended with a frantic whoop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that whoop was unfortunate, for coming close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ear of the horse, and being quite unexpected,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it startled the stallion extremely. He shied violently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ugh-lomi suddenly found himself uncomfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. He was banging on to the horse, he found,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one arm and one knee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rest of the ride was honourable but unpleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant. The view was chiefly of blue sky, and that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">combined with the most unpleasant physical sensa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. Finally, a bush of thorn lashed him and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">let go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hit the ground with his cheek and shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then, after a complicated and extraordinarily rap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">id movement, hit it again with the end of his back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone. He saw splashes and sparks of light and</seg><seg type="columnLine">colour. The ground seemed bouncing about just</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the horse had done. Then he found he was sit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting on turf, six yards beyond the bush. In front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him was a space of grass, growing greener and</seg><seg type="columnLine">greener, and a number of human beings in the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance, and the horse was goiny round at a smart</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallop quite a long way off to the right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The human beings were 011 the opposite side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, some still in the water, but they were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">running away as hard as they could go. The advent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a monster that took to pieces was not the sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">novelty they cared for. For quite a minute Ugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lomi sat regarding them in a purely spectacular</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit. The bend of the river, the knoll among die</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeds and royal ferns, the thin streams of smoke go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up to Heaven, were all perfectly familiar to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the squatting-place of the Sons of Uya, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uya from whom he had fled with Eudena, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he had waylaid in the chestnut woods and</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed with the First Axe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rose to his feet, still dazed from his fall, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he did so the scattering fugitives turned and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garded him. Some pointed to the receding horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chattered. He walked slowly towards them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring. He forgot the horse, he forgot his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">bruises, in the growing interest of this encounter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were fewer of them than there had been--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he supposed the others must have hid--the heap of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fern for the night fire was not so high. By the flint</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaps should have sat Wau--but then he remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered he had killed Wau. Suddenly brought back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this familiar scene, the gorge and the bears and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eudena seemed things remote, things dreamt of.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped at the bank and stood regarding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe. Plis mathematical abilities were of the slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est, but it was certain there were fewer. The men</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be away, but there were fewer women and chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren. He gave the shout of home-coming. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarrel had been with Uya and Wau--not with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. "Children of Uya!" he cried. They an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered with his name, a little fearfully because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange way he had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a space they spoke together. Then an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman lifted a shrill voice and answered him. "Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord is a Lion."	. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ugh-lomi did not understand that saying. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered him again several together, "Uya comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. He comes as a Lion.

He speaks no more to men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ugh-lomi stood regarding them. He had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams--he knew that though he had killed Uya,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uya still existed. And now they told him Uya was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Lion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shrivelled old woman, the mistress of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire-minders, suddenly turned and spoke softly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">those next to her. She was a very old woman in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, she had been the first of Uya's wives, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had let her live beyond the age to which it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemly a woman should be permitted to live. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been cunning from the first, cunning to please</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uya and to get food. And now she was great in</seg><seg type="columnLine">counsel. She spoke softly, and Ugh-lomi watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">her shrivelled form across the river with a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">distaste. Then she called aloud, "Come over to us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ugh-lomi."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A GIRL suddenly lifted up her voice. "Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to us, Ugh-lomi," she said. And they all</seg><seg type="columnLine">began crying, "Come over to us, Ugh-lomi."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was strange how their manner changed after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old woman called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood quite still watching them all. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant to be called, and the girl who had called</seg><seg type="columnLine">first was a pretty one. But she made him think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eudena.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come over to us, Ugh-lomi," they cried, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice of the shrivelled old woman rose above them</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. At the sound of her voice his hesitation re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood on the river bank, Ugh-lomi--Ugh the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thinker--with his thoughts slowly taking shape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently one and then another paused to see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would do. He was minded to go back, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded not to. Suddenly his fear or his caution got</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper hand. Without answering them he turned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walked back towards the distant thorn-trees, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wav he had come. Forthwith the whole tribe started</seg><seg type="columnLine">crying to him again very eagerly. He hesitated and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned, then he went on, then he turned again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then once again, regarding them with troubled eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they called. The last time he took two paces</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, before his fear stopped him. They saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop once more, and suddenly shake his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanish among the hawthorn-trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then all the women and children lifted up their</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices together, and called to him in one last vain</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far down the river the reeds were stirring in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze, where, convenient for his new sort of feed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, the old lion, who had taken to man-eating, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his lair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old woman turned her face that way, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to the hawthorn thickets. "Uya," she'</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed, "there goes thine enemy! There goes</seg><seg type="columnLine">thine enemy, Uya! Why do you devour us nightly?</seg><seg type="columnLine">We have tried to snare him! There goes thine</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy. Uya!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the lion who preyed upon the tribe was taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his siesta. The cry went unheard. That day he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dined on one of the plumper girls, and his mood was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a comfortable placidity. He really did not under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand that he was Uya or that Ugh-lomi was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it was that Ugh-lomi rode the horse, and heard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">first.of Uya the lion, who had taken the place of Uya</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Master, and was eating up the tribe. And as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried back to the gorge his mind was no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of the horse, but of the thought that Uya was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still alive, to slay or be slain. Over and over again</seg><seg type="columnLine">be saw the shrunken band of women and children</seg><seg type="columnLine">crying that Uya was a lion. Uya was a lion!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And presently, fearing the twilight might come</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him, Ugh-lomi began running.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Uya the Lion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE old lion was in luck. The tribe had a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain pride in their ruler, but that was all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction they got out of it. He came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very night that Ugh-lomi killed Uya the Cunning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so it was they named him Uya. It was the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, the fire-minder, who first named him Uya.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A shower had lowered the fires to a glow, and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night dark. And as they conversed together, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered at one another in the darkness, and wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearfully what Uya would do to them in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams now that he was dead, they heard the mount-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing reverberations of the lion's roar close at hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then everything was still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They held their breath, so that almost the. only</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds were the patter of the rain and the hiss of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the raindrops in the ashes. And then, after an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terminable time, a crash, and a shriek of fear, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a growling. They sprang to their feet, shouting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming, running this way and that, but brands</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not burn, and in a minute the victim was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing dragged awav through the ferns. It was Irk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brother of Wau.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the lion came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ferns were still wet from the rain the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, and he came and took Click with the red hair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That sufficed for two nights. And then in the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the moons he came three nights, night after</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, and that though they had good fires. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old lion with stumpy teeth, but very silent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">very cool; he knew of fires before; these were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first of mankind that had ministered to his old</seg><seg type="columnLine">age. The third night he came between the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire and the inner, and he leapt the flint heap, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled down Irrn the son of Irk. who had seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to be the leader. That was a dreadful night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because they lit great flares of fern and ran scream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and the lion missed his hold of Irm. By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare of the fire they saw Irm struggle up, and run</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little way towards them, and then the lion in two</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounds had him down again. That was the last of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So	fear came, and all the delight of spring passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of their lives. Already there were five gone out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tribe, and four nights added three more to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the" number. Food-seeking became spiritless, none</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew who might go next, and all day the women</seg><seg type="columnLine">toiled, even the favourite women, gathering litter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sticks for the night fires. And the hunters</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunted ill: in the warm spring-time hunger came</seg><seg type="columnLine">again as though it was still winter. The tribe might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have moved, had they had a leader, but they had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader, and none knew where to go that the lion</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not follow them. So the old lion waxed fat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thanked heaven for the kindly race of men. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the children and a youth died while the moon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">740</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">still new. and then it was the shrivelled old fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minder first bethought herself in a dream of Eudena</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ugh-lomi, and of the way Uya had been slain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had lived in fear of Uya all her days, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">she lived in fear of the lion. That Ugh-lomi could</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill Uya for good--Ugh-lomi whom she had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">born--was impossible. It was Uya still seeking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then came the strange return of Ugh-lomi,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wonderful animal seen galloping far across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, that suddenly changed into two animals, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse and a man. Following this portent, the vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ugh-lomi on the farther bank of the river. . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yes. it was all plain to her. Uya was punishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, because they had not hunted down Ugh-lomi</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Eudena.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men came straggling back to the chances of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night while the sun was still golden in the sky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were received with the story of Ugh-lomi. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">went across the river with them and showed them</seg><seg type="columnLine">his spoor hesitating on the farther bank. Siss the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tracker knew the feet for Ugh-lomi's. "Uya needs</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ugh-lomi," cried the old woman, standing on file</seg><seg type="columnLine">left of the bend, a gesticulating figure of flaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">bronze in the sunset. Her cries were strange sounds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flitting to and fro on the borderland of speech, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was the sense they carried: "The lion needs</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eudena. He comes night after night seeking Eu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dena and Ugh-lomi. When he cannot find Eudena</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ugh-lomi, he grows angry and he kills. Hunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eudena and Ugh-lomi, Eudena whom he pursued,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ugh-lomi for whom he gave the death-word!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hunt Eudena and Ugh-lomi!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned to the distant reed-bed, as sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had turned to Uya in his life. "Is it not so. my</seg><seg type="columnLine">lord?" she cried. And, as if in answer, the tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeds bowed before a breath of wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far into the twilight the sound of hacking was</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard from the squatting-places. It was the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharpening their ashen spears against the hunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the morrow. And in the night, early before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon rose, the lion came and took the girl of Siss the</seg><seg type="columnLine">T racket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the morning before the sun had risen, Siss the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tracker, and the lad W'au-hau, who now chipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">flints, and One Eye, and Bo. and the snail-eater, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two red-haired men. and Cat's-skin and Snake, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men that were left alive of the Sons of Uya,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking their ash spears and their smiting-stones, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with throwing stones in the beast-paw bags, started</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth upon the trail of Ugh-lomi through the haw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorn thickets where Yaaa the Rhinoceros and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brothers were feeding, and tip the bare downland</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the beechwoods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night the fires burnt high and fierce, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waxing moon set. and the lion left the crouching</seg><seg type="columnLine">women and children in peace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the next day, while the sun was still high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hunters returned--all save One Eye, who lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead with a smashed skull at the foot of the ledge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Ugh-lomi came back that evening from</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalking the horses, he found the vultures already</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy owr him. And with them the hunters brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eudena bruised and wounded, but alive. That had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the strange order of the shrivelled old woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was to be brought alive--"She is no kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us. She is for Uya the I,ion." Her hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied with thongs, as though she had been a man, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she came weary and drooping--her hair over her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and matted with blood. They walked about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her, and ever and again the Snail-Eater, whose name</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had given, would laugh and strike her with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashen spear. And after he had struck her with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear, he would look over his shoulder like one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done an over-bold deed. The others, too, looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">over their shoulders ever and again, and all were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hurry save Eudena. When the old woman saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them coming, she cried aloud with joy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They made Eudena cross the river with her hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied, although the current was strong, and when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped the old woman screamed, first with joy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then for fear she might be drowned. And when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had dragged Eudena to shore, she could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand for a time, albeit they beat her sore. So they</seg><seg type="columnLine">let her sit with her feet touching the water, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes staring before her, and her face set, whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might do or say. All the tribe came down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the squatting-place, even curly little Haha, who as</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet could scarcely toddle, and stood staring at Eu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dena and the old woman, as now we should stare at</seg><seg type="columnLine">some strange wounded beast and its captor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE old woman tore off the necklace of Uya</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was about Eudena's neck, and put it on</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself--she had been the first to wear it. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she tore at Eudena's hair, and took a spear from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Siss and beat her with all her might. And when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had vented the warmth of her heart on the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">she looked closely into her face. Eudena's eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed and her features were set, and she lay so still</seg><seg type="columnLine">that for a moment the old woman feared she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead. And then her nostrils quivered. At that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old woman slapped her face and laughed and gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spear to Siss again, and went a little way off</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her and began to talk and jeer at her after her</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old woman had more words than any in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe. And her talk was a terrible thing to hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sometimes she screamed and moaned incoherently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sometimes the shape of her guttural cries was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mere phantom of thoughts. But she conveyed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eudena, nevertheless, much of the things that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet to come, of the Lion and of the torment he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">do her "And Ugh-lomi! Ha, ha! Ugh lomi is</seg><seg type="columnLine">slain ?''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And suddenly Eudena's eye'- opened and she sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">up again, and her look met the &gt;1(1 woman's lair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">level. "No," she said slowly, like -me trying :o re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member, "I did not see my Ugh-lomi slain, i did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not see my Ugh-lomi slain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell her, ' cried the old woman "Tell her--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">that killed him. fell her how Ugh-lomi was slain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked, and all the women and children there</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked, tiom man to man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> None answered her. They stood shamefaced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell her." said the old woman. The men looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at one another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eudena's face suddenly lit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell her," she said. "Tell her, mighty men! Tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">her the killing of Ugh-lomi."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old woman rose and struck her sharply across</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We could not find Ugh-lomi." said Siss the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tracker, slowly. "Who hunts two. kills none."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Eudena's heart leapt, but she kept her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard. It was as well, for the old woman looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her sharply, with murder in her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the old woman turned her tongue upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">A STORY OF THE STONE AGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">741</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">men because they had feared to go on alter Ugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lomi. She dreaded no one now Uya was slain. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">scolded them as one scolds children. And they</seg><seg type="columnLine">scowled at her, and began to accuse one another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Until suddenly Siss the Tracker raised his voice and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bade her hold her peace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so when the sun was setting they took Eu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dena and went--though their hearts sank within</seg><seg type="columnLine">them--along the trail the old lion had made in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeds. All the men went together. At one place</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a group of alders, and here they hastily bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eudena where the lion might find her when he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">abroad in the twilight, and having done so they hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried back until they were near She squatting-place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then they stopped. Siss stopped first and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back again at the alders. They cotild see her head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even from the squatting-place, a little black shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the limb of the larger tree. Tl&amp;t was as well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the women and children stood watching upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crest of the mound. And the old xvoman stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">and screamed for the lion to take her whom he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought, and counselled him on the torments he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">do her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eudena was very weary now. stunned by beatings</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fatigue and sorrow, and only the fear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that was still to come upheld her. The sun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad and blood-red between the stems of the distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">chestnuts, and the west was all on fire; the evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze had died to a warm tranquillity. The air was</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of midge swarms, the fish in the river hard by</seg><seg type="columnLine">would leap at times, and now and again a cockchafer</seg><seg type="columnLine">would drone through the air. Out of the corner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eye Eudena could see a part of the squatting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">knoll. and little figures standing and staring at her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And--a very little sound but very clear--she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear the beating of the firestone. Dark and near to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and still was the reed-fringed thicket of the lair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently the firestone ceased. She looked for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun and found he had gone, and overhead and grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing brighter was the waxing moon. She looked to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards the thicket of the lair, seeking shapes in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeds, and then suddenly she began to wriggle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wriggle, weeping and calling upon Ugh-lomi.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Ugh-lomi was far away. When they saw her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head moving with her struggles, they shouted to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether on the knoll, and she desisted and was still.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then came the bats, and the star that was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ugh-lomi crept out of its blue hiding-place in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west. She called to it, but softly, because she feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lion. And all through the coming of the twilight</seg><seg type="columnLine">the, thicket was still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SO the dark crept upon Eudena, and the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew bright, and the shadows of things that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fled up the hillside and vanished with the evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back to them short and black. And the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapes in the thicket of reeds and alders where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion lay, gathered, and a faint stir began there. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing came out therefrom all through the gather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked at the squatting-place and saw the fires</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing smokv-recl. and the men and women going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to and fro. The other wav. over the river, a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist was rising. Then far away came the whimper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of young foxes and the yell of a hyaena.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were long gaps of aching waiting. After a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time some animal splashed in the water, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to cross the river at the ford beyond the lair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but what animal it was she could not see. From the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">distant drinking-pools she could hear the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashing, and the noise of elephants--so still was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The earth was now a colourless arrangement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">white reflections and impenetrable shadows, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue sky. The silvery moon was already spotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the filigree crests of the chestnut woods, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the shadowy eastward hills the stars were mul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiplying. The knoll fires were bright red now, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">black figures stood waiting against them. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for a scream. . . . Surely it would be soon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The niglrt suddenly seemed full of movement. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">held her breath. Things were passing--one, two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">three--subtly sneaking shadows. . . . Jackals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a long waiting again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, asserting itself as real at once over all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds her mind had imagined, came a stir in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thicket, then a vigorous movement. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snap. The reds crashed heavily, once, twice, thrice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then everything was still save a measured swish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. She heard a low tremulous growl, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything was still again. The stillness lengthened</seg><seg type="columnLine">--would it never end ? She held her breath ; she bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">her lips to stop screaming. Then something scuttled</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the undergrowth. Pier scream was involun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary. She did not hear the answering yell from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately the thicket woke up to vigorous</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement again. She saw the grass stems waving in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light of the setting moon, the alders swaying.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She struggled violently--her last struggle. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing came towards her. A dozen monsters seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing about in that little place for a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, and then again came silence. The moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank behind the distant chestnuts and the night was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then an odd sound, a sobbing panting, that grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster and fainter. Yet another silence, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim sounds and the grunting of some animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything was still again. Par away eastwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">an elephant trumpeted, and from the woods came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarling and yelping that died away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the long interval the moon shone out again, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the stems of the trees on the ridge, sending</seg><seg type="columnLine">two great bars of light and a bar of darkness across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reedy waste. Then came a steady rustling, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">splash, and the reeds swayed wider and wider apart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And at last they broke open, cleft from root to</seg><seg type="columnLine">crest. . . . The end had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked to see the thing that had come out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reeds. For a moment it seemed certainly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great head and jaw she expected, and then it dwin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dled and changed. It was a dark low thing, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained silent, but it was not the lion. It became</seg><seg type="columnLine">still--everything became still. She peered. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like some gigantic frog, two limbs and a slanting</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. Its head moved about searching the shadows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A RUSTLE, and it moved clumsily, with a sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hopping. And as it moved it gave a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">groan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blood rushing through her veins was sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly joy. "Ugh-lomi!" she whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thing stopped. "Eudena" he answered softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">with pain in his voice, and peering into the alders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved again, and came out of the shadow be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the reeds into the moonlight. All his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">was covered with dark smears. She saw he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragging his legs, and that he gripped his axe, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">742</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">first axe, in one hand. In another moment he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled into the position of all fours, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered over to her. "The lion," he said in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange mingling of exultation and anguish. "Wau!</seg><seg type="columnLine">--I have slain a lion. With my own hand. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I slew the great bear." He moved to emphasize</seg><seg type="columnLine">his words, and suddenly broke off with a faint cry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a space he did not move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me free," whispered Eudena. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He answered her no words but pulled himself up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from bis crawling attitude by means of the alder</seg><seg type="columnLine">stem, and hacked at her thongs with the sharp edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bis axe. She beard him sob at each blow. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut away the thongs about her chest and arms, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then bis band dropped. His chest struck against</seg><seg type="columnLine">her shoulder and he slipped down beside her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the rest of her release was easy. Very hast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily she freed herself. She made one step from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree, and her bead was spinning. 1 ler last conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement was towards him. She reeled, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped. Her band fell upon bis thigh. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft and wet, and gave way under her pressure; be</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried out at her touch, and writhed and lay still</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently a dark dog-like shape came very softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the reeds. Then stopped dead and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">sniffing, hesitated, and at last turned and slunk back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the shadows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long was the time they remained there motion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, with the light of the setting moon shining on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their limbs. Very slowly, as slowly as the setting</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the moon, did the shadow ol the reeds towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mound flow over them. Presently their legs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden, and Ugh-lomi was but a bust of silver. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow crept to bis neck, crept over his face, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so a! !a--t the darkness of the night swallowed them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'JP-	.....</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shadow became full of instinctive stirrings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a patter of feet, and a faint snarling--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of a blow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE was little sleep that night for the wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and children at the squatting-place until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they beard Eudena scream. But the men were weary</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sat dozing. When Eudena screamed they felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured of their safety, and hurried to get the near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est places to the fires. The old woman laughed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scream, and laughed again because Si, the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend of Eudena, whimpered. Directly the dawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">came they were all alert and looking towards the al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders. They could see that Eudena had been taken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They could not help feeling glad to think that Uya</seg><seg type="columnLine">was appeased. But across the minds of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought of Ugh-lomi fell like a shadow. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">could understand revenge, for the world was old</seg><seg type="columnLine">in revenge, but they did not think of rescue. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly a hyaena fled out of the thicket, and came gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loping across the reed space. His muzzle and paws</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dark-stained. At that sight all the men shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clutched at throwing-stones and ran towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, for no animal is so pitiful a coward as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hyaena by day. All men hated the hyaena because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">preyed on children, and would come and bite when</seg><seg type="columnLine">one was sleeping on the edge of the squatting-place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Cat's-skin, throwing fair and straight, hit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute shrewdly on the flank, whereat the whole tribe</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelled with delight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the noise they made there came a flapping of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wings from the lair of the lion, and three white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed vultures rose slowly and circled and came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest amidst the branches of an alder, overlooking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lair. "Our lord is abroad," said the old woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing. "The vultures have their share of Eu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dena.'' For a space they remained there, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">first one and then another dropped back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thicket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then over the eastern woods, and touching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole world to life and colour, poured, with the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">altation of a trumpet blast, the light of the rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun. At the sight of him the children shouted to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, and clapped their hands and began to race</seg><seg type="columnLine">off towards the water. Only little Si lagged behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked wonderingly at the alders where she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen the head of Eudena overnight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Uya, the old lion, was not abroad, but at</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, and he lay very still, and a little on one side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was not in his lair, but a little way from it in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">place of trampled grass. Under one eye was a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound, the feeble little bite of the first axe. But all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground beneath his chest was ruddy brown with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vivid streak, and in bis chest was a little bole that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad been made by Ugh-lomi's stabbing-spear. Along</seg><seg type="columnLine">his side and at his neck the vultures bad marked&lt;</seg><seg type="columnLine">their claims. For so Ugh-lomi bad slain him, lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken under his paw and thrusting haphazard at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chest. He had driven the spear in with all bis</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength and stabbed the giant to the heart. So it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the reign of the lion, of the second incarnation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Uya the Master, came to an end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the knoll the bustle of preparation grew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the backing of spears and throwing-stones. None</seg><seg type="columnLine">spake the name of Ugh-lomi for fe.-ir th;»i it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring him. The men were going to keep together,</seg><seg type="columnLine">close together, in the bunting for a day or so. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hunting was to be Ugh-lomi, lest instead he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should come a-hunting them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Ugh-lomi was lying very still and silent, out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the lion's lair, and Eudena squatted beside him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the ash spear, all smeared with lion's blood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped in her hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Fight in the Lion's Thicket</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UGII-LOMI lay still, bis back against an alder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his thigh was a red mass terrible to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">No civilized man could have lived who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been so sorely wounded, but Eudena got him thorns</seg><seg type="columnLine">to close his wounds, and squatted beside him day</seg><seg type="columnLine">and night, smiting the flies from him with a fan of</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeds by day, and in the night threatening the hyaenas</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the first axe in her hand; and in a little while</seg><seg type="columnLine">be began to heal. It was high summer, and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no rain. Little food they had during the first two</seg><seg type="columnLine">days his wounds were open. In the low place where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they hid were no roots nor little beasts, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream, with its water-snails and fish, was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open a hundred yards awav. She could not go abroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">by day for fear of the tribe, her brothers and sisters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor by night for fear of the beasts, both on bis ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count and hers. So they shared the lion with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vultures. But there was a trickle of water near by,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Eudena brought him plenty in her hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Where Ugh-lomi lay was well bidden from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe by a thicket of alders, and all fenced about with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulrushes and tall reeds. The dead 'ion he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">A STORY OF THE STONE AGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">743</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">killed lay near his old lair on a place of trampled</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeds fifty yards away, in sight through the reed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stems, and the vultures fought each other for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">choicest pieces and kept the jackals off him. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon a cloud of flies that looked like, bees hung over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and Ugh-lomi could hear their humming. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Ugh-lomi's flesh was already healing--and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not many days before that began--only a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones of the lion remained scattered and shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">white.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the most part Ugh-lomi sat still during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, looking before him at nothing, sometimes he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would mutter of the horses and bears and lions, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes he would beat the ground with the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">axe and say the names of the tribe--he seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no fear of bringing the tribe--for hours to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether. But chiefly he slept, dreaming little because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his loss of blood and the slightness of his food.</seg><seg type="columnLine">During the short summer night both kept awake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All the while darkness lasted things moved about</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, things they never saw by day. For some</seg><seg type="columnLine">nights the hysenas did not come, and then one moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less night near a dozen came and fought for what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was left of the lion. The night was a tumult of</seg><seg type="columnLine">growling, and Ugh-lomi and Eudena could hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones snap in their teeth. But they knew the hyaena</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare not attack any creature alive and awake, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so they were not greatly afraid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of a daytime Eudena would go along the narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">path the old lion had made in the reeds until she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beyond the bend, and then she would creep into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thicket and watch the tribe. She would lie close</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the alders where they had bound her to offer her</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the lion, and thence she could see them on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knoll by the fire, small and clear, as she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen them that night. But she told Ugh-lomi little</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what she saw, because she feared to bring them</seg><seg type="columnLine">by their names. For so they believed in those days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that naming called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She saw the men prepare stabbing-spears and</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing-stones on the morning after Ugh-lomi had</seg><seg type="columnLine">slain the lion, and go out to hunt him, by leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women and children on the kitoll. Little they knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">how near he was as they tracked off in single file</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the hills, with Siss the Tracker leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. And she watched the women and children,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the men had gone, gathering fern-fronds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twigs for the night fire, and the boys and girls run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning and playing together. But the very old woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">made her feel afraid. Towards noon, when most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others were down at the stream by the bend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she came and stood on the hitiier side of the knoll,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gnarled brown figure, and gesticulated so that Eu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dena could scarce believe she was not seen. Eudena</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay like a hare in its form, with shining eyes fixed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bent witch away there, and presently she dimly</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood it was the lion the old woman was wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipping--the lion Ugh-lomi had slain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AND the next day the hunters came back weary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">1\. carrying a fawn, and Eudena watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feast enviously. And then came a strange thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She saw--distinctly she heard--the old woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieking and gesticulating and pointing towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. She was afraid, and crept like a snake out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight again. But presently curiosity overcame her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she was back at her spving-place, and as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered her heart stopped, for there were all the men,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with their weapons in their hands, walking together</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards her from the knoll.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She dared not move lest her movement should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen, but she pressed herself close to the ground. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun was low and the golden light was in the faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the men. She saw they carried a piece of rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">red meat thrust through by an ashen stake. Pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently they stopped. "Go 011!'' screamed the old wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Cat's-skin grumbled, and they came on, search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the thicket with sun-dazzled eyes. "Here!" said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Siss. And they took the ashen stake with the meat</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it and thrust it into the ground. "Uya!" cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Siss, "behold thy portion. And Ugh-lomi we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">slain. Of a truth we have slain Ugh-lomi. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">day we slew Ugh-lomi, and to-morrow we will bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">his body to you." And the others repeated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They looked at each other and behind them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly turned and began going back. At first they</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked half turned to the thicket, then facing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mound they walked faster looking over their shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders, then faster; soon they ran, it was a race at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last, until they were near the knoll. Then Siss who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hindmost was first to slackcn his pace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sunset passed and the twilight came, the fires</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed red against the hazy blue of the distant chest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nut-trees, and the voices over the. mound were</seg><seg type="columnLine">merry. Eudena lay scarcely stirring, looking from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mound to the meat and then to the mound. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hungry, but she was afraid. At last she crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to Ugh-lomi.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked round at the little rustle of her approach.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His face was in shadow. "Have you got me some</seg><seg type="columnLine">food ?" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said she could find nothing, but that she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">seek further, and went back along the lion's path</seg><seg type="columnLine">until she could see the mound again, but she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not bring herself to take the meat; she had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute's instinct of a snare. She felt very miserable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She crept back at last towards Ugh-lomi and heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">him stirring and moaning. She turned back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mound again; then she saw something in the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness near the stake, and peering distinguished a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jackal. In a flash -she was brave and angry; she</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang up, cried out, and ran towards the offering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She stumbled and fell, and heard the growling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jackal going off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she arose only the ashen stake lay on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, the meat was gone. So she went back, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast through the night with Ugh-lomi; and Ugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lomi was angry with her, because she had no food</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him; but she told him nothing of the things she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two days passed and they were near starving,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the tribe slew a horse. Then came the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceremony, and a haunch was left on the ashen stake;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but this time Eudena did not hesitate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By acting and words she made Ugh-lomi under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand, but he ate most of the food before he under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood ; and then as her meaning passed to him he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew merry with his food. "I am Uya." he said;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am the Lion. I am the Great Cave Bear, I who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only Ugh-lomi. I am Wau the Cunning. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">well that they should feed me, for presently I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill them all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Eudena's heart was light, and she laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him; and afterwards she ate what he had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the horseflesh with gladness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that it was he had a dream, and the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">744</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">day he made Eudena bring him the lion's teeth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">claws--so much of them as she could find--and hack</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a club of alder. And he put the teeth and claws</seg><seg type="columnLine">very cunningly into the wood so that the points were</seg><seg type="columnLine">outward. Very long it took him, and he blunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of the teeth hammering them in, and was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry and threw the thing away; but afterwards he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged himself to where he had thrown it and fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished it--a club of a new sort set with teeth. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">day there was more meat for them both, an offering</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the lion from the tribe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was one day--more than hand's fingers of days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than anyone had skill to count--after Ugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lomi had made the club, that Eudena while he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep was lying in the thicket watching the squat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting-place. There had been no meat for three days.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the old woman came and worshipped after her</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner. Now while she worshipped, Eudena's little</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend Si and another, the child of the first girl Siss</seg><seg type="columnLine">had loved, came over the knoll and stood regarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">her skinny figure, and presently they began to mock</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Eudena found this entertaining, but suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old woman turned on them quickly and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. For a moment she stood and they stood mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionless, and then with a shriek of rage, she rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards them, and all three disappeared over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crest of the knoll.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PRESENTLY the children reappeared among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferns beyond the shoulder of the hill. Little Si</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran first, for she was an active girl, and the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">child ran squealing with the old woman close upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. And over the knoll came Siss with a bone in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand, and Bo and Cat's-skin obsequiously behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, each holding a piece of food, and they laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud and shouted to see the old woman so angry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And with a shriek the child was caught and the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman set to work slapping and the child screaming,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was very good after-dinner fun for them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Little Si ran on a little way and stopped at last be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween fear and curiosity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And suddenly came the mother of the child, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair streaming, panting, and with a stone in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and the old woman turned about like a wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat. She was the equal of any woman, was the chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fire-minders, in spite of her years; but before</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could do anything Siss shouted to her and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamour rose loud. Other shock heads came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight. It seemed the whole tribe was at home and</seg><seg type="columnLine">feasting. But the old woman dared not go on</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreaking herself on the child Siss befriended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everyone made noises and called names--even</seg><seg type="columnLine">little Si. Abruptly the old woman let go of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">child and made a swift run at Si. for Si had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends; and Si. realizing her danger when it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost upon her, made off headlong, with a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry of terror, not heeding whither she ran, straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the lair of the lion. She swerved aside into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeds presently, realizing now whither she went.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the old woman was a wonderful old woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as active as she was spiteful, and she caught Si bv</seg><seg type="columnLine">the streaming hair within thirty yards of Eudena.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All the tribe now was running down the knoll and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting and laughing ready to see the fun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then something stirred in Eudena; something</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had never stirred in her before; and. thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of little Si and nothing of her fear, she sprang up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her ambush and ran swiftlv forward. The old</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman did not see her. for she was busy beating</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">little Si's face with her hand, beating with all her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">heart, and suddenly something hard and heavy struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">her cheek. She went reeling, and saw Eudena with</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming eyes and cheeks between her and little Si.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She shrieked with astonishment and terror, and little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Si, not understanding, set off towards the gaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe. They were quite close now, for the sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eudena had driven their fading fear of the lion out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their heads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment Eudena had turned from the cower-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing old woman and overtaken Si. "Si!" she cried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Si 1" She caught the child up in her arms as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, pressed the nail-lined face to hers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned about to run towards her lair, the lair of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old lion. The old woman stood waist-high in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeds, and screamed foul things and inarticulate</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage, but did not dare to intercept her; and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bend of the path Eudena looked back and saw all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men of the tribe crying to one another and Siss</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming at a trot along the lion's trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She ran straight along the narrow way through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reeds to the shady place where Ugh-lomi sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his healing thigh, just awakened by the shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and rubbing his eyes. She came to him, a wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, with little Si in her arms. Her heart throbbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her throat. "Ugh-lomi!" she cried, "Ugh-lomi,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tribe comes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ugh-lomi sat staring in stupid astonishment at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and Si.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She pointed with Si in one arm. She sought among</seg><seg type="columnLine">her feeble store of words to explain. She could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men calling. Apparently they had stopped out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. She put down Si and caught up the new club</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the lion's teeth, and put it into Ugh-lomi's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and ran three yards and picked up the first axe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah!" said Ugh-lomi, waving the new club, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly he perceived the occasion and, rolling over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to struggle to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood but clumsily. He supported himself by</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand against the tree, and just touched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground gingerly with the toe of his wounded leg.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the other hand he gripped the new club. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at his healing thigh; and suddenly the reeds</seg><seg type="columnLine">began whispering, and ceased and whispered again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and coming cautiously along the track, bending down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and holding his fire-hardened stabbing-stick of ash</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand, appeared Siss. He stopped dead, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes met Ugh-lomi's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UGH-LOMI forgot he had a wounded leg. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood firmly on both feet. Something trickled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He glanced down and saw a little gout of blood had</seg><seg type="columnLine">oozed out along the edge of the healing wound. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubbed his hand there to give him the grip of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">club, and fixed his eyes again on Siss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wau!" he cried, and sprang forward, and Siss,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still stooping and watchful, drove his stabbing-stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">up very quickly in an ugly thrust. It ripped Ugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lomi's guarding- arm and the club came down in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter that Siss was never to understand. He fell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">•as an ox falls to the pole-axe, at Ugh-lomi's feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To Bo it seemed the strangest thing.

He was prepared to shove behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and send Siss to death or victorv. That was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">place as second man. He saw the butt of the spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">Siss carried leap away from him. and suddenly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">A STORY OF THE STONE AGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">745</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dull whack and the broad back fell away forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he looked Ugh-lomi in the face over his prostrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader. It felt to Bo as if his heart had fallen down</seg><seg type="columnLine">a well. He had a throwing-stone in one hand and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashen stabbing-stick in the other. He did not live to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of his momentary hesitation which to use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snail-eater was a readier man, and besides Bo</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not fall forward as Siss had done, but gave at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knees and hips, crumpling up with the toothed</seg><seg type="columnLine">club upon his head. The Snail-eater drove his spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward swift and straight, and took Ugh-lomi in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the muscle of the shoulder, and then be drove him</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard with the smiting-stone in his other hand, shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out as he did so. The new club swished inef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectually through the reeds. Eudena saw Ugh-lomi</seg><seg type="columnLine">come staggering back from the narrow path into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open space, tripping over Siss and with a foot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashen stake sticking out of him over his arm. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the Snail-eater, whose name she had given, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">his final injury from her, as his exultant face came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the reeds after his spear. For she swung the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first axe swift and high, and hit him fair and square</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the temple; and down he went on Siss at pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trate Ugh-lomi's feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before Ugh-lomi could get up, the two red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired men were tumbling out of the reeds, spears</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smiting-stones ready, and Snake hard behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. One she struck 011 the neck, but not to fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and he blundered aside and spoilt his brother's</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow at Ugh-lBmi's head. In a moment Ugh-lomi</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped his club and had his assailant by the waist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had pitched him sideways sprawling. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched at his club again and recovered it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man Eudena had hit stabbed at her with his spear as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stumbled from her blow, and involuntarily she</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave ground to avoid him. He hesitated between</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and Ugh-lomi, half turned, gave a vague cry at</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding Ugh-lomi so near, and in a moment Ugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lomi had him by the throat, and the club had its</seg><seg type="columnLine">third victim. As he went down Ugh-lomi shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">--no words, but an exultant cry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other red-haired man was six feet from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his back to her, and a darker red streaking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bead. He was struggling to his feet. She had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">irrational impulse to stop his rising. She flung the</seg><seg type="columnLine">axe at him, missed, saw his face in profile, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had swerved beyond little Si, and was running</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the reeds. She had a transitory vision of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snake standing in the throat of the path, half turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from her, and then she saw his back. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the club whirling through the air, and the shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of Ugh-lomi, with blood in the hair and blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the shoulder, vanishing below the reeds in pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit. Then she heard Snake scream like a woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She ran past Si to where the handle of the axe</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck out of a clump of fern, and turning, found</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself panting and alone with three motionless bod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ies. The air was full of shouts and screams. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a space she was sick and giddy, and then it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into her head that Ugh-lomi was being killed along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reed-path, and with an inarticulate cry she leapt</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the body of Bo and hurried after him. Snake's</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet lay across the path, and his head was among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeds. She followed the path until it bent round</seg><seg type="columnLine">and opened out by the alders, and thence she saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that was left of the tribe in the open, scattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">like dead leaves before a gale, and going back over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knoll. Ugh-lomi was hard upon Cat's-skin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Cat's-skin was fleet of foot and got away, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">so did young Wau-Hau when Ugh-lomi turned upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and Ugh-lomi pursued Wau-Hau far beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knoll before be desisted. He had the rage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle on him now, and the wood thrust through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder stung him like a spur. When she saw he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in no danger she stopped running and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting, watching the distant active figures run up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vanish one by one over the knoll. In a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">time she was alone again. Everything had hap</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened very swiftly. The smoke of Brother Fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose straight and steady from the squatting-place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as it had done ten minutes ago, when the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman had stood yonder worshipping the lion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AND after a long time, as it seemed, Ugh-lomi</seg><seg type="columnLine">reappeared over the knoll, and came back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eudena, triumphant and breathing heavily. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, her hair about her eyes and hot-faced, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blood-stained axe in her hand, at the place where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tribe had offered her as a sacrifice to the lion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wau!" cried Ugh-lomi at the sight of her, his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">alight with the fellowship of battle, and he waved</seg><seg type="columnLine">his new club, red now and hairy; and at the sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his glowing face her tense pose relaxed some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what, and she stood sobbing and rejoicing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ugh-lomi had a queer unaccountable pang at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of her tears; but he only shouted "Wau!" the</seg><seg type="columnLine">louder and shook the axe cast and west. He called</seg><seg type="columnLine">manfully to her to follow him and turned back, strid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, with the club swinging in his hand, towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatting-place, as if he had never left the tribe; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she ceased her weeping and followed quickly as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman should.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Ugh-lomi and Eudena came back to the squat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting-place from which they had fled many days be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore from the face of Uya; and by the squatting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">place lay a deer half eaten, just as there had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Ugh-lomi was man or Eudena woman. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ugh-lomi sat down to eat, and Eudena beside him</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a man, and the rest of the tribe watched them</seg><seg type="columnLine">from safe hiding-places. And after a time one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elder girls came back timorously, carrying little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Si	in her arms, and Eudena called to them by name,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and offered them food. But the elder girl was afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">and would not come, though Si struggled to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Eudena. Afterwards, when Ugh-lomi had eaten,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sat dozing, and at last he slept, and slowly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others came out of the hiding-places and drew near.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And when Ugh-lomi woke, save that there were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">men to be seen, it seemed as though he had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the tribe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, there is a thing strange but true: that'all</seg><seg type="columnLine">through this fight Ugh-lomi forgot that he was lame,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was not lame, and after he had rested behold!</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was a lame man; and he remained a lame man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of his days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cat's-skin and the second red-haired man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wau-Hau, who chipped flints cunningly, as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">father had done befor.e him, fled from the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ugh-lomi, and none knew where they hid. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">two days after they came and squatted a good way</seg><seg type="columnLine">off from the knoll among the bracken under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chestnuts and watched. Ugh-lomi's rage had gone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he moved to go against them and did not, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">sundown they went away. That day, too, they found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old woman among the ferns, where Ugh-lomi</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad blundered upon her when she had pursued Wau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hau.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">basic facts in Seiior Wells' story, and in the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">also, are science.

"It would be mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness not to admit such obvious truths. You dream,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend, and as you dream all that occurs is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">your brain real and existent, and yet, when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wake, you feel convinced that your dreams were</seg><seg type="columnLine">unreal, that nothing existed in them and that only</seg><seg type="columnLine">during your waking* hours do your senses record</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters which truly exist. But suppose, if you can,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that matters are in reality reversed, that your dreams</seg><seg type="columnLine">are actualities and your impressions during waking</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours phantasies. Or imagine again, that both your</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams and your waking-hour experiences are both</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally real, but that, during your slumbers, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter into another sphere, into the unknown, unex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plored realm of a fourth dimension. What proof</seg><seg type="columnLine">nave you that your dreams are not as existent as</seg><seg type="columnLine">your other impressions? None! my friend, not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shred of proof; merely the fact that for generations</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have been taught" that dreams were imaginary</seg><seg type="columnLine">figments of the brain. It is just as true of count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less other matters. Does space exist? Do length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath and thickness exist?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," I interrupted. "Otherwise no object,</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither you nor I, could exist, and geometry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other mathematics could not exist. I--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ARDON me," he broke in. smiling deprecat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inglv. "But are you quite sure of that? A</seg><seg type="columnLine">mathematical line, a mathematical plane, does not</seg><seg type="columnLine">exist, and hence a mathematical cube or parallelo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gram cannot exist, and. if we accept Seiior Einstein's</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory, two parallel lines will eventually meet. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact is, my friend, that we--or most of us at least--</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot grasp the infinite. We are bound down, tied</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and foot to our own petty sphere, to this earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ours which is an infinitesimal atom in the uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse, and we measure everything by earthly stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ards and by our own five senses. We can conceive</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nothing that we cannot smell, taste, touch, see or</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear. No living man can conceive or describe any</seg><seg type="columnLine">form totally unlike anything on earth. No man can</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceive or describe a color or a sound unlike any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing he has ever seen or heard. Did you ever think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that, amigo miof And only a comparatively few</seg><seg type="columnLine">men can realize that there is--scientifically speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">--no such thing as solid matter. A few years ago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand things in common use today would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been scoffed at as impossible. Even today it is hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the average man to understand radio, to under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand why an airplane flies, and it is still harder to</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize that objects which we speak of as solids are</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely the result of combinations of electrons and</seg><seg type="columnLine">protons. And it is a thousand times more difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the average man to conceive of everything being,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as is unquestionably the case, merely the result of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibratory waves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on!" I exclaimed. "You are getting be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond me, and I cannot see where your highly enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining lecture is leading. What has all this to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the elimination of space ? And how can matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">be composed of waves?" Doctor Mentiroso sighed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shrugged his shoulders expressively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I forget, dear friend, that you are an example</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the average man," he laughed. "All that I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">said has a direct bearing on the elimination of space</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the fourth dimension. But to answer your last</seg><seg type="columnLine">question. We know that light, heat, sound, elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricity, radio, color, smell are all the result of vibra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory waves. And beyond question there are count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less thousands of vibratory waves too short or too</seg><seg type="columnLine">long to be received or intercepted by the human</seg><seg type="columnLine">organs. Heat vibrations are invisible until they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduced to a length perceptible to the eye. Light</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations are not detectable by the sense of touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">or feeling until they are lengthened to the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they are known as heat. Only a small per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centage of sound vibrations are within the range of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the human ear, and electro-magnetic vibrations can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be detected by any human organ until so altered</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to become sound waves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shook my head. "Before you proceed," I begged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"can you make this a bit clearer? You say that heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations can be made visible, that light waves can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be made detectable by touch. How ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If," replied Don Fenomeno, speaking slowly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">choosing his words, "if you heat a bar of iron up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain point it will burn wood or your skin, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet you cannot detect its heat by your eyesight. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">if heated slightly more, it becomes red, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know it is 'red hot,' as you say, because you see it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In other words, you have gradually decreased the</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of the heat vibrations until they become</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible. If the iron is heated still more, the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">becomes white, or in other words the vibrations have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been shortened until -they appear as white light to</seg><seg type="columnLine">your eyes. Conversely, the white or red vibrations</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be lengthened to invisible heat rays by allowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metal to cool. In other words, light waves are</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengthened until they become invisible but recogniz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able by touch and are considered heat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then," said I, quite pleased with myself, "accord-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to your theory, light and heat are identical."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tn a way, yes." replied Don Mentirosn. "But. in</seg><seg type="columnLine">DISCOVERIES OF DOCTOR MENTIROSO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">749</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the same way, all vibrations are identical, for all are</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused merely by the movement of electrons--forc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing more electrons into a given space or depriving</seg><seg type="columnLine">some space of its normal number of electrons. Pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibly your mind cannot conceive the fact, but never-</seg><seg type="columnLine">theless, every force, every power, every motion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">every body, and in fact everything we know--per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps our thoughts, our senses and our so-called life--</seg><seg type="columnLine">are merely the results of electronic motion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, even if I grant all this, what has it to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the original subject of our discussion?" 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Everything," declared my friend. "Granted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything is the result of electronic movement, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know, of course, that the electrons are in effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">miniature satellites revolving about a central nucleus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as the earth and moon revolve about the sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then we must admit that nothing actual, as we know</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, exists; that everything is merely relative and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time itself must be the mere expression, in arbitrary</seg><seg type="columnLine">terms, of some electronic force or vibratory waves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nonsense," I exclaimed. "I suppose you will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">claiming that time does not "exist."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">«'T KNOW it does not," was his astounding reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> X "It is merely a relative term coined for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">convenience of the human race. But permit me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceed. I will demonstrate this to you presently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You asked about the fourth dimension a moment ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now let me ask you a question. Has a circle length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">breadth or thickness?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, of--" I hesitated. "Certainly," I declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a moment's thought. "A wheel or a disk has</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickness, and its diameter is its breadth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doctor Mentiroso laughed. "Right," he agreed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But neither a wheel nor a disk is a circle; it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely an object or form bounded by a circle. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the definition of a circle. A mathematical plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its boundary equidistant from its centre every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where. Did not your geometry attempt to solve all</seg><seg type="columnLine">problems by dividing the circle into triangles? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet a triangle has three straight boundaries, whereas</seg><seg type="columnLine">a circle has no portion of its boundary or circumfer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence straight. In other words, amigo mio, as a circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">possesses neither length, breadth nor thickness, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">must of necessity possess a fourth dimension, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mathematicians, knowing nothing of a fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimension, must of necessity fit their geometry to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the occasion and attempt crudely to transform it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">triangles which have length and breadth. And yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">circles may be transformed to length or breadth just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as triangles or parallelograms may be transformed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into cubes or pyramids." "Then," I laughed, "you</seg><seg type="columnLine">consider the circle the fourth dimension?" "Not at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all," he exclaimed a bit impatiently. "I am merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to demonstrate to you that a fourth dimension</seg><seg type="columnLine">must exist or otherwise there could be no circles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">consequently no spheres and consequently no revo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutions or rotations of electrons, atoms, stellar bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">or anything else. The earth could not rotate on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">axis, it could not follow its orbit about the sun, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of these things would be possible with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence of length, breadth and thickness alone, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">parallel lines which never meet and with mathemati-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal planes. No, my friend, the fourth dimension</seg><seg type="columnLine">exists, it is ever present, it is^essential to our lives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our existence and to our universe, but being as</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet inconceivable to us, we cannot describe it, meas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure it or understand it. Tt is. in fact, beyond our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">present senses, just as the higher and lower sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations, the shorter and longer light waves, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the radio waves are undetectable by our organs."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That is a safe way of putting it," I said. "Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, if we assume that no one can detect it, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one can be positive that it does not exist. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't you think all that is negative evidence? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">how does it affect the question of time elimination,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of going into the past or future while still in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">present, which was, Don Fenomeno,'the original mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter under discussion ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I presume," he replied after a moment's thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that you do not consider it possible to enter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future, while still in the present."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I certainly do not," I assured him.

Suppose, for the sake of argu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. that you or I possessed means of traveling to</seg><seg type="columnLine">750</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">or from India instantaneously, or even at undreamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of speed--at a speed which, let us say, enabled us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to visit India and return in an hour or two. In that</seg><seg type="columnLine">case, amigo mio, had you been in India when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfortunate accident occurred, you could have flown</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and could have declared--with absolute cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainty--that a railway accidcnt would occur and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixteen persons would lose theit lives at 7 P. M. even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though you reached Lima at 6 A. M. And, suppos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing again, that no wireless communication existed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that, in due course of time, mail from India con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmed your statement, would not the public have</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared you a prophet who could foretell the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was actually stumped. But presently I gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wits together. This was, 1 knew, utter nonsense.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was all the result of the variation in time due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth's rotation on its axis, and 1 felt that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend was merely arguing for the sake of trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">convince me the impossible was possible by scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory. Doctor Mentiroso listened patiently, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a half-pitying, half-indulgent smile, as 1 ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed these sentiments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are, in a way, dealing with the pith of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole matter," he announced when I ceased .speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. "That is, you refer to the variation of time, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rotation of the earth, and by so doing you tacitly</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit that time is actually non-existent, that, scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tifically speaking, there is no past, no present and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">future; for, if time, as you understand it, exists; if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the past vanishes and the future is never present,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then time would be the same everywhere. Your so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called time, therefore, is merely a relative term used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to describe the motion of the earth in its relation</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the sun. In other words, human beings have</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered that our sphere rotates upon its axis and</seg><seg type="columnLine">follows its orbit about the sun, and for convenience,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mankind has seen fit to divide the rotation and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbit into periods which we are pleased to call hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, months and years. But time literally is a far</seg><seg type="columnLine">different matter. It is in fact infinite, it goes on into</seg><seg type="columnLine">infinity and springs from infinity. Nothing in na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. amigo mio. is ever wasted or destroyed, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it may alter in form or substance. The light</seg><seg type="columnLine">we see here, the image which such light throws upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">our brains by the medium of our eyes, does not end</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, any more than it began here. It is merely a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibratory wave which has travelled millions of miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and will continue to travel millions, trillions of miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">--into infinity in fact--and as it requires an appre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciable period for even light to travel, every visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">event of the past must be somewhere in that infinity</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as every event of the future must be recorded</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere and Is travelling toward us to be revealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it reaches us. In the same way, time is but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibratory wave, a movement of electrons, and could</seg><seg type="columnLine">one but follow the path of time at a greater speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the vibratory wave travels, then most assuredly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could one witness events which transpired a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a hundred thousand years ago. Or, going in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other direction, he could see events which would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">transpire on earth for thousands of vears to come.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on," T cried. "You are merely theorizing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying scientific hypotheses to the ultimate degree.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And besides, even if I admit your preposterous state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments to be theoretically sound, you are carrying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole matter beyond the range of possibilities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">human beings and into space; they do not apply to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">happenings on earth and hence, as I said before, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is impossible for us to enter either the past or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought I had stumped my friend, but I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistaken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fERY well," he agreed. "It is hard, I admit,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> V for the average man to visualize or comprehend</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything beyond the confines of our own planet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So, my friend, we will confine ourselves to this petty</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth of ours. And to prove to you that my state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments and 'theories' are sound, let me call your atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to a few facts which, with a little reflection, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">must recognize as irrefutable. The earth, you know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolves from west to east at an approximate speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 1,000 miles per hour, and hence each so-called</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour of time represents approximately one thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles of the earth's greatest circumference. Bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mind, please, that in speaking of these matters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am referring always to approximate figures--</seg><seg type="columnLine">though if you wish, I can give you the exact figures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But to resume. Grantejl then that it is. according</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the accepted ideas of time, noon. Monday, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lima; it will be approximately six P. M. in f.ondon</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Barcelona; 12 P. M. in Calcutta and 6 A. M. in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawaii. "Yes," 1 assented. "Roughly speaking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well," continued Doctor Mentiroso. ''Sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose, for the sake of argument, that you are pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided with a machine which can travel through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air at a speed of 1,000 miles per hour, and suppos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that in this machine you start eastward from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lima at noon today. It is also assumed that you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">set your watch in accord with Lima time and will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">alter it until you again arrive at Lima. At what</seg><seg type="columnLine">time would you reach Barcelona?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did a bit of mental calculation and replied con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidently: "At 6 P. M." Don Fenomeno laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">heartily. "Oh, my dear friend." he exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wrong at the very start. You forget that at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment you left Lima it was noon and hence 6 P. M.</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Spain. And as you have supposedly consumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">six hours in reaching your destination, it will be 12</seg><seg type="columnLine">P. M. when you arrive there, although your watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">will tell you that it is but 6 P. M. So you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">already traveled six hours into the future. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">well. Suppose you leave at once for Calcutta; at</seg><seg type="columnLine">what hour will you arrive at that Indian city ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time I was a bit more careful, and after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment's hesitation replied"At noon on Tuesday."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly--according to Calcutta's clocks," as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented my friend. "But suppose you glance at your</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch. You will find that it is only 12 P. M. on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monday, so that you have now entered twelve hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the future. But continue eastward and head for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawaii. Reaching that delightful spot, what time</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you find it is?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rapidly figuring with a pencil on a,scrap of paper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gave my answer: "Approximately 12 P.

Tuesday."</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled the doctor. "Tn other words, you find</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawaii's time precisely the same as was Calcutta's</seg><seg type="columnLine">six hours before, while you have traveled back from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the future six hours towards the present: and. con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuing your mad flight to Lima, you will discover</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you complete your journey around the earth at</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon on Tuesday--twenty-four hours after leaving;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and remarkable as it may seem, your watch and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">DISCOVERIES OF DOCTOR MENTIROSO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">751</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">clocks in Lima agree on the hour.

But before challenging your state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. let me, for the sake of clarity, give you a brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">summary of the examples I have been drawing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">your edification. Your watch, as you have seen, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept at Lima time, would be constantly in the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent (speaking approximately and regarding for our</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose the space of one hour as present) and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">you woidd have been at spots where yesterday's</seg><seg type="columnLine">events were occurring and at others where tomorrow's</seg><seg type="columnLine">happenings were taking place. And, this, my friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is important: Provided the speed of the machine in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which you travel could be accelerated so as to travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster than light, you could go backward or forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the past or present or into the fourth dimension.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover, as the human eye is incapable of register-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the alternating effects of darkness and light at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed greater than about 20 per second (as exempli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied in the cinema), if you were passing rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough about the earth, you could see no difference</seg><seg type="columnLine">between light and darkness, could not realize time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and would appear to remain stationary and with time</seg><seg type="columnLine">non-existent; and at the same time, you would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite invisible to the eyes of any human beings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But even if your speed were not greater than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moderate speed of 24,000 miles per hour, you would</seg><seg type="columnLine">of necessity go farther and farther into the past and</seg><seg type="columnLine">future at every lap about the earth until--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">&lt;{jVyTODERATE speed," I interrupted.

"Nothing is farther from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts. 1 started out to convince you that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elimination of time was not impossible, and that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth dimension exists and has been discovered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, Doctor Fenomeno Mentiroso, your most humble</seg><seg type="columnLine">servant and very good friend. I admit that, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary conditions, a machine traveling at such high</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeds as I mentioned, would become heated to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">incandescent point, but such a result would be due</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely to the friction of the air. Suppose then that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine should travel beyond the atmospheric</seg><seg type="columnLine">envelope of the earth, or that means could be found</seg><seg type="columnLine">for eliminating air friction. In that case, you must</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit there would be no fear of heating."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can suppose anything." I replied. "But sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">positions are not actualities, and no one will ever be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to travel through space or overcome air friction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That, at least, you must admit is impossible. "On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contrary," declared Don Fenomeno, "I insist that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is not only possible but that it actually has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplished."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gazed at my friend in incredulous amazement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had Doctoi' Mentiroso taken leave of his senses?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or was he merely trying to lead me on for the sake</seg><seg type="columnLine">of argument? Unquestionably, I decided, it must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter, for my friend was obviously as sane as</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, and was smiling at me in such a supercilious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or rather I might say, triumphant manner, that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite sure he had something up his sleeve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps," I suggested with a laugh, "you mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">it has been accomplished theoretically.

Moreover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two discoveries are closely correlated, or, shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">I say, dependent one upon the other.

I cried, now convinced that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend had taken leave of his senses, but anxious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see how far he had gone, "You spoke of your ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus traveling ten thousand miles an hour and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now you tell me you have traveled around the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">eleven times faster than the globe rotates on its axis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't get that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I forgot to mention," he explained, "that the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery of the principle of the fourth dimension also</seg><seg type="columnLine">included the elimination of gravitational, attraction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it is commonly called, and as I have already told</seg><seg type="columnLine">you that my discoveries do away with atmospheric</seg><seg type="columnLine">friction you will at once understand that a machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling at an initial velocity of ten thousand miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour, and free from atmospheric friction and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitational pull, will, when headed eastward, travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that speed plus the speed of the earth's rotation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or approximately 11,000 miles per hour. I think--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Very good," I agreed, still determined to humor</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, "but if there is no attraction of gravitation, why</seg><seg type="columnLine">did you not fly ofFinto space?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The fourth dimension again," he answered. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">will, of course, be difficult for you to understand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I'll try to explain it in terms which are familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you. And I see that you think I am crazy. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">not surprised, my friend, but, as a matter of fact, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was never saner. I think, before I am through, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will realize this. But to reply to your most</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural query. If, for example, you jump into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, you temporarily overcome gravitation through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the use of muscular power which is greater than tbe</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of gravity on your body, but you can only</seg><seg type="columnLine">jump so far. In other words, your limit is one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three recognized dimensions. If you jump longi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tudinally, the same thing occurs, for your leap is</seg><seg type="columnLine">limited by length; and here let me call your attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a very ordinary, but hitherto entirely overlooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter, which is of the utmost importance. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">you leap upward, you return to your original posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion or to the earth in an approximately straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">line. But when you leap longitudinally, you travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">from start to finish in a curved line. Although, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as I am aware, this phenomenon has never at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted much attention, it is an indication of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence of the fourth dimension. But I am di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gressing. Just as your recognized three dimensions</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure your jump perpendicularly or horizontally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so the fourth dimension regulates or controls the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance my apparatus can move against gravitational</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull; perhaps it might be better to say that the gravi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tational pull controls the fourth dimension."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">(( ANOTHER point." I insisted. "If you over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">1~\ come air friction, how do you propel your</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine? I may be a layman, but I fail to see how</seg><seg type="columnLine">any apparatus can be propelled without friction. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have always understood that it was frictional resist -</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence which propelled an airplane."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Usually it is," he replied. "But in the present</seg><seg type="columnLine">case, no. My apparatus embodies an entirely new</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">principle. I am very sorry, but I scarcely like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">divulge it at present, and," he added with a laugh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you probably wouldn't be any the wiser for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I might if I could see it," I suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Possibly," he repeated with an odd smile. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will leave that until later. As I remarked, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult for me to convey an adequate idea of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus, but I will do my best. Relieved of what is</seg><seg type="columnLine">known as the attraction of gravitation, the machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, rises or is thrown violently upward from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth, its upward flight controlled by the use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fourth dimension, which, for reasons I will ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain, I have called 'Esnesnon.' Being free from air</seg><seg type="columnLine">friction, as I have already said, it remams stationary</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the earth and its envelope of atmosphere whirls</seg><seg type="columnLine">from east to west at 1,000 miles per hour, the result</seg><seg type="columnLine">being the same as if the apparatus were traveling</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastward at 1,000 miles per hour."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you stated that your machine traveled at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of 10,000 miles per hour," I objected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So it does," he declared, as calmly as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking of fifty or one hundred miles an hour.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And that speed, added to the speed of the earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotation, equals the 11,000 miles I referred to. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my good friend, I have already told you that; how</seg><seg type="columnLine">many times must I repeat such simple matters?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They may appear simple to you," I said, "and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be sane as you say, but to me the mere thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such speed is too staggering to believe. And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">still fail to see how you propel your machine when,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you claim, you eliminate air friction or pressure or</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever you may call it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was coming to that very point when you inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted me," he replied a bit impatiently. "As I said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth's atmospheric envelope is sweeping past the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus at a speed of 1,000 miles per hour. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">other words, the apparatus stands isolated in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">centre of a one thousand miles per hour hurricane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Is that clear?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perfectly clear," 1 assured him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well," be continued. "Now let me ask you</seg><seg type="columnLine">a question. Did you ever hear of the so-called rotor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, a vessel invented and constructed a few years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago by a German?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly," I replied. "Tjie vessel, as I recall it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was provided with large cylindrical masts or towers</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were revolved at high speed, the idea being</seg><seg type="columnLine">that wind impinging on a rotating surface produces</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vacuum and forces the rotating surface forward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the rotor ship, I believe, proved a complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">failure. Anyhow, what has that to do with your</seg><seg type="columnLine">discoveries ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing, directly," he said, "I was merely seek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing some familiar thing which I could use as a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parison to enable you to grasp the basic principles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my apparatus. And I might add that the rotor-ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a failure from a mechanical or scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of view, but was merely commercially imprac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tical, owing to various factors which in no way affect</seg><seg type="columnLine">its principle. But to continue. If, when within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of air moving at 1,000 miles an hour, a portion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that force of air were permitted to strike upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolving surface, my apparatus would rush forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly as the rotor-vessel was propelled, only im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">measurably faster."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can understand that," I admitted. "But it cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly would not move forward at 10.000 miles an</seg><seg type="columnLine">754</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hour when the speed of the air was only 1,000 miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour. Moreover, what means could you employ</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prevent the air friction if you used that friction</seg><seg type="columnLine">for your propelling force? It seems to me, my friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you are contradicting yourself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again, Don Fenomeno smiled that superior ami</seg><seg type="columnLine">condescending smile. "Suppose the entire frictional</seg><seg type="columnLine">force were exhausted in propelling the machine," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed. ''And by rotating the rotors, as we may</seg><seg type="columnLine">call them, rapidly enough to absorb all the friction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and by allowing the friction of the air to act upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain properly designed surfaces elsewhere, the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus would and actually did travel at the speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 have mentioned, although I admit I employ the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitational pull as an auxiliary force. Just as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">airplane rises and moves forward because of the angle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of incidence upon its planes, so, by utilizing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitational force which would tend to draw my</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine to earth, and then by special apparatus pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venting it from descending, I would achieve a similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">result and force the machine forward."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But tell me," I broke in, now thoroughly inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested and quite oblivious of the seeming impossibil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ities he was describing. "Tell me what power you</seg><seg type="columnLine">use to accomplish these marvels. And what is this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth dimension or 'Esnesnon' as you call it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll answer your last question first," he replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Although, as a matter of fact, I cannot exactly ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain what 'Esnesnon' is myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 laughed. "You say you've discovered something</seg><seg type="columnLine">you cannot describe," I exclaimed. "Come now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don Fenomeno, aren't you trying to see how far</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can spoof me, as the British say?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DOCTOR MENTIROSO flushed. "If it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not for the fact that you are a very old and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear friend of mine, and inexpressibly stupid, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should take offense at that remark and should refuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say another word," he declared. "But under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances, amigo mio, and knowing that you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">really most simpatico, and that it is most difficult to</seg><seg type="columnLine">convince one of anything quite new and revolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionary, I shall with patience control myself and will</seg><seg type="columnLine">do my little best to convince you that I am serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at the same time make clear to your uncom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehending mind exactly what I have done and how</seg><seg type="columnLine">it has been accomplished. You say I contradict my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. My friend, you no doubt admit the existence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of oxygen, of hydrogen, of nitrogen, of electricity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of radio waves and of numerous other things which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world accepts and uses in every walk of life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You admit, unquestionably, that the entire life of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our planet, if not other planets as well, the existence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the universe in fact, depends upon the gases I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have mentioned. But can you or any other man de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribe them ? Can you give a clear definition of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen, for example, is like? Have you or has</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone else ever seen it? And yet it has been dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered ; it is in daily, hourly use; it is combined,</seg><seg type="columnLine">isolated, confined, and, in combination with other</seg><seg type="columnLine">materials, it assumes tangible forms. The same is</seg><seg type="columnLine">true of electricity, of radio waves, of countless other</seg><seg type="columnLine">things I might mention. 'Esnesnon' is much the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same. It is invisible, intangible, indescribable, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet without it the universe could not exist, and like</seg><seg type="columnLine">many other things, it can be isolated, utilized and</seg><seg type="columnLine">combined with other things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hinm. There may be something in that." I ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted. "You say the 'Esnesnon' is not a force but a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dimension. What then is the power or force you em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploy to achieve your amazing results?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The greatest force or power in the entire uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse," declared Don Fenomeno. "The force which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for want of a better term, is known as the attraction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gravitation; the force which holds the planets to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their orbits, the earth to its rotation, the spheres in</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, and prevents you and me and the world about</seg><seg type="columnLine">us from being transformed into attenuated gaseous</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shook my head in despair. "You're getting be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond me again," I expostulated. "I've always un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstood that the attraction of gravitation is down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward or towards the centre of the earth. In that</seg><seg type="columnLine">case, I can't see how you can utilize the power ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept for coming down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course the pull is downward, or rather to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards the centre of the earth--or towards the actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of any object," he exclaimed. "Every body has</seg><seg type="columnLine">its gravitational force, which is exerted upon other</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies. But please understand, my friend, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">so-called attraction of gravitation is an electronic</seg><seg type="columnLine">force and not a magnetic force. As far as your</seg><seg type="columnLine">other question is concerned, may I call your atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to the fact that the force of water is also down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. you never saw a waterfall flow upward; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet, as you know, water power may be utilized for</seg><seg type="columnLine">innumerable purposes and to produce force for driv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing mechanisms in every direction. The same is</seg><seg type="columnLine">true of the force of gravitation. Once its mysteries</seg><seg type="columnLine">are mastered, it may be used as freely as water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam, electricity or any other force, and being the</seg><seg type="columnLine">supreme force of all forces, and the source of all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its power properly directed, is millions of times</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater than any other known power."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how on earth did you happen to discover all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this?"

I have rediscovered them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They have been known for centuries--perhaps thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands of years. No, do not look so skeptical, amigo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am speaking the unvarnished truth and will ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain. As you know, far more Inca than Spanish</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood flows in my veins, and for long I have devoted</seg><seg type="columnLine">much time to studying the history and remains of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ancestors. The stupendous works of the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Incas in particular have always been a source of</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvel and wonder to me, as to yourself and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless thousands of other men. Feats which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">performed seem almost supernatural, as you know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The massive walls about Cuzco and Lake Titicaca,</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls composed of stupendous blocks weighing scores</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tons; blocks of twenty to thirty or more faces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and each so perfectly cut and so accurately fitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that even today a pen-point cannot be inserted be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the stones; the cyclopean monuments and</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings; the tunnels cut through many feet of liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ro,ck; the enormous fortresses; the marvellous</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal work, all these facts •performed by the long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead race have puzzled every archeologist and no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">has hitherto been able to explain by what unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">means they were accomplished. But to me, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I am about to divulge it, to you, the secret is</seg><seg type="columnLine">known at last. All these great feats, my friend, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple matters to my ancestors, for they, of all men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had discovered the fourth dimension and the key to</seg><seg type="columnLine">utilizing the forces of gravitation. Two years ago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">DISCOVERIES OF DOCTOR MENTIROSO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">755</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in the unknown and unexplored territory east of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lake Titicaca, I learned of a ruined city from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians.

But I could make little</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, familiar as I was with the language of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Incas. At last luck or fortune, or perhaps the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirits of my ancestors, favored me. A11 earthquake</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent the ground and threw down a massive piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall to disclose a hidden chamber wherein were</seg><seg type="columnLine">stored priceless records of the race who once had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwelt there and who, as I soon learned, were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highest caste of the mysterious pre-Incan people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, too, and most wonderful of all, was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">key to the glypths, besides countless strange instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments and utensils; wonderful works in copper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bronze and gold; plans of the monuments, the for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tresses and the walls which exist throughout Peru</seg><seg type="columnLine">today, and here, as franctically, fascinated I studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glyphs and records, I learned that my ancestors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully twenty centuries before the coming of Pizarro,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had mastered the secrets of the fourth dimension and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gravitational force and had harnessed them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">by their aid had accomplished the seeming miracles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cyclopean work which we wonder at today. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be of little interest and would be a long story</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell you all the details of my discovery, amigo mio.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But to me, a descendant of that strange highly civil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized but forgotten race, was given the fortune to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn the secrets and laws of nature which, centuries</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago, had been discovered, and centuries later had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been lost through wanton destruction of a nation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And herein, my friend, my ancestors failed. All they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had learned they had applied to peaceful arts; never</seg><seg type="columnLine">did it occur to them that the tremendous, the ir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistible forces they alone knew, could be used</seg><seg type="columnLine">against their enemies, that no beings could resist</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. But T, T, Don Fenomeno Mentiroso, scfior, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am not so blind. With the powers and forces I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">rediscovered from the records of my ancestors, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have within my grasp that which will place my coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try forever beyond fear of conquest or of war. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">united powers of the world might attempt to subdue</seg><seg type="columnLine">or to humble Peru, but they would be as powerless</seg><seg type="columnLine">as so many buzzing flies. Their navies could be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed. their armies wiped out. their artillery ren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered useless, their aircraft annihilated as fast as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could be assembled ; this could be done by means</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which they could not cope. Tt is for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason that T will never divulge my secrets. But do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not think that 1 fail to realize the importance of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery to the arts of peace. But. greater to me is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the importance of my accomplishments as a safe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard to my country. T . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, yes." I interrupted, seeing that my tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peramental and patriotic friend was rapidly working</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself into a fervor, and, Latin-like, would continue</seg><seg type="columnLine">his oratorical talk indefinitely. "Yes, Don Fenom-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eno, my good friend, I can clearly see your point.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is indescribably noble of you and worthy of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">son of the Incas. But let us leave this side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter for the present and confine ourselves to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">further consideration of the scientific and practical</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of your most marvellous discoveries."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Most certainly," he exclaimed. "Pardon me for</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far digressing from the theme. Let me see, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling you of the power I employ and you asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">how I happened to discover it. Now-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have explained that," I reminded him. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I do not fully grasp all the technicalities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your twin discoveries or of your apparatus, I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">I understand the principles, although I admit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole affair is so absolutely astounding as to seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible. And I freely admit that were anyone but</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself to make such statements I should unhesitat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly put him down as worthy rival of Baron</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miinchhausen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My friend rose and bowed. "Thank you, a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand thanks to you, amigo, for the implied compli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment," he laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But there is another question," I continued. "Did</seg><seg type="columnLine">I understand you to say that you actually had</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled around the earth on your, or in your secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You did, and I have," he assured me, "not once</seg><seg type="columnLine">but several times, and each time my observations and</seg><seg type="columnLine">records proved conclusively that my deductions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculations were sound and correct, and that with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proper means at my command, I can go into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future or the past and can eliminate 'time' as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">call it. Strictly speaking, of course, time is but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">relative term, a mere arbitrary word, whereas actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">time is a wave governed and controlled by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Esnesnon,' and is no more like your arbitrary con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ception of time and bears 110 more relation to it than</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen does to water or nitrogen bears to nitrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of potassium. In other words, my friend, your so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called time is governed by the 'Esnesnon' whiie the</seg><seg type="columnLine">true time, and by that I mean the phase of the vibra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory time wave, is not in any way affected by your</seg><seg type="columnLine">conception of time. Is that clear?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About as clear as mud," I grinned. "But if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have traveled about the earth at 11.000 miles an hour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how in the world could you see or observe anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">while moving at that rate of speed?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ff/'AH, my poor friend!" he exclaimed pityingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> V_y"Can you not grasp the fundamental truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all things are relative? To you, a speed is great</seg><seg type="columnLine">or small merely by comparison with your much</seg><seg type="columnLine">slower motions and surroundings. W^ere you dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a thousand foot precipice, you would see noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing but a blurr as you hurtled earthward, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">condor or the eagle, dropping for thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, and at terrific speed, sees the smallest bird or</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal and strikes it unerringly. And so. in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus wherein your cloving, arbitrary time is</seg><seg type="columnLine">non-existent, and surrounded and controlled by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth dimension, a speed which to you would seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">incomprehensibly swift, seems merely a slow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady jog to me. Indeed, though perhaps you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not believe it, my circumnavigation of the earth ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pears to me, at the time, to be no shorter than when,</seg><seg type="columnLine">several years ago. I went around the world in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Dollar Line steamships. Not until I return</seg><seg type="columnLine">and step from the fourth dimensional machine into</seg><seg type="columnLine">756</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the humdrum present, do I realize that the journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">has consumed only an hour or two. Now if only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you, too-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing doing," I announced positively, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could complete his sentence. "I'll leave it to you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But tell me, when did you make your last trip?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don Fenomeno glanced at his watch. "By your</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, I returned to Lima at 8 p.m. yesterday," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied, as casually as though referring to a motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride of a few miles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And at what hour did you start on this wondrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laughed. "At midnight, last night," was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?" I gasped. "What nonsense is this? You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He raised his hand and checked me. "Have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten so soon all the examples I gave you?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. "Do you not remember that I pointed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, if you should travel eastward at a speed greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the rotation of the earth, you would be back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Lima before you started? For example, I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">planning another trip today and as I travel at a rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of approximately 11,000 miles per hour, and start</seg><seg type="columnLine">at eleven thirty--precisely one hour from now--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I will of necessity be back this morning at 7.30, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight difference in figures between my example and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the actuality being due to the fact that my route does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not precisely follow the equatorial circumference of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sank back in my chair and ran my hands through</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hair. "It's all the dreamiest, weirdest hodge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">podge, the most involved and incomprehensible thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ever heard," I cried. "Why, man alive, if I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing aright, and you're serious, then in an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll start off and this morning at seven-thirty you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be back, and I'll be here at nine and you'll tell -</seg><seg type="columnLine">me all this damned nonsense over again, and start</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and . . . why confound it all, if that's true,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-day'll go on forever or . . . good Heavens, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes my head reel to think about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doctor Mentiroso laughed heartily. "My dear</seg><seg type="columnLine">good friend," he exclaimed. "Do not be so perturbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. You forget that you are talking and think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of arbitrary time, whereas I am referring to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth dimensional, or real time. No. my friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though by your time I may set forth at half after</seg><seg type="columnLine">eleven today and return this morning at seven thirty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet by actual time I set out and returned at precisely</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same moment of your time. No--be patient a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, for there are many puzzling features of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter, some of which I confess I have not fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">mastered myself as yet. But it is obvious, amigo</seg><seg type="columnLine">mio, that did I actually arrive at seven thirty this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning from a trip on which I am to start out</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hours after I arrive, then I certainly could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be present in the interim. But I propose, my friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you witness a most interesting experiment which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I am not mistaken, will convince you of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soundness of my statements. You can be of great</seg><seg type="columnLine">help to me then."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">&lt;&lt;T '11 gladly do anything within reason to help you,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 I assured him, still a bit dazed at the night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marish problems his words had started in my mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I'll do nothing rash, and I will not try any</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunts in that mad machine of yours. For that mat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, I'm beginning to think its all bosh and you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no such machine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll soon convince you of that," he declared. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I am about to ask of you is neither rash nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">risky. I would merely like to have you witness my</seg><seg type="columnLine">departure and return and check up on the phenomena.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If, as you and others claim, your so-called time really</seg><seg type="columnLine">exists, then beyond question, I cannot encircle the</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe--no matter how fast I travel, and yet be back</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours before I set forth or even instantaneously. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other hand, if I am right and your time is a ridi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culous, nonsensical and childish thing, with no basis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and true time is entirely distinct, then 1 will of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainty be back before I start or at least at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same moment. Are you willing, amigo mio, to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">the test?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gladly," I declared. "Come, show me your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">11,000-mile-an-hour machine and hop off for a trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the earth, and I'll wait and time you. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't keep up this joke much longer, old man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once again, Don Fenomeno smiled in his oddly</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior way and rose from his chair. "Very well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my good friend," he remarked. "I think within a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few moments you are due to have a rather astound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing surprise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He led the way through a heavily barred and pad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked door to a large windowless room, or rather,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I might say, an open court enclosed by high massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls. In the centre, and resting on a sort of pedestal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of black stone, was an elliptical or egg-shaped contri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vance of a peculiar bluish color, reminding me of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blued steel, and about thirty f$et in length by eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">or ten feet in diameter. I regret that I cannot give</seg><seg type="columnLine">a detailed description of the thing, for one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions on which Doctor Mentiroso insisted be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore granting me permission to make public his dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coveries, was that I should omit all detailed descrip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of his apparatus or its mechanism. I may state,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, that the exterior of the machine was cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered with spiral flanges or bands, so that it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat the appearance of a gigantic screw; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">several pyramidal or mushroom-shaped projections</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke its surface, and that it had no wings or planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an airship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This," announced my friend, "is the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I referred to." -</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It appears to be a machine all right," I admitted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but it certainly does not appear capable of rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">or of progressing, and even more certainly not at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any such speed as you claim for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Don Fenomeno laughed. "Appearances," he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded me, "are often very deceptive. But as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say in English, 'the proof of the pudding is in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating.' In a few moments, my friend, you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">change your mind. And let me forewarn you; you</seg><seg type="columnLine">may witness some rather disconcerting events but</seg><seg type="columnLine">you need not be either surprised or alarmed at any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing which may transpire. It now lacks but three</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes of the time for my departure. Will you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">amigo mio, stand here and time me in my flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the earth ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gladly," I replied, "provided your flight does not</seg><seg type="columnLine">consume too much time.

"Even if you are right, it will be a short time</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I return."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is, if you go or return at all," 1 said. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">let us get this clear. You claim you'll return before</seg><seg type="columnLine">you start or at the same time, which I claim is mani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">festly impossible; I claim that, granting there's no</seg><seg type="columnLine">fake to cill this and that by some incredible means</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can fly around the earth in that contraption at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speed you state, you'll be back here in approxi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mately two hours. Am I right?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Absolutely," he agreed while he approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism and stopped to examine some knobs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dials on the black rock pedestal. "Would you mind,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked, "standing about here. You'll be better able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to witness some of the phenomena which may take</seg><seg type="columnLine">place." He indicated a step leading to the pedestal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was, as he said, a fine point of vantage, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to make sure that there was no trickery</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the matter, despite my faith in Don Fenomeno,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I took my place as he suggested. Smiling, my friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">then stepped to his machine, climbed upon, it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening a sliding panel, stepped within. "Don't leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">until I'm back," he cautioned me, as with only his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head visible he prepared to close the door. "It's im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant for you to remain exactly where you are.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You see," he added as if in explanation, "I cannot be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a witness of the phenomena and I want you to tell me</seg><seg type="columnLine">about everything that takes place. Now take out</seg><seg type="columnLine">your watch and time me, for I'll be off in a jiffy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS he spoke, he ducked into his machine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew the panel shut. Wondering what, if any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, would happen next, I glanced at my watch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it precisely eleven thirty. As I did so there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a strange roar from the machine before me; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden wind seemed to sweep with terrific force</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the courtyard; I swayed on my feet; my head</seg><seg type="columnLine">swam dizzily; I had the impression of being hurl'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and over, and then, as suddenly as it had begun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the noise ceased, the air was calm and still and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head cleared. I glanced at the pedestal and stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">with unbelieving eyes. The egg-shaped apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">had vanished! It was true then! My friend had ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tually taken flight in his strange machine. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtedly that explained the rush of air and my sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sations, for assuredly a mass of that size could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have hurtled upward at over ten thousand miles an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour without creating a terrific vortex in its wake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardly had these thoughts rushed through my brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">when once more the blast of a hurricane roared about</seg><seg type="columnLine">me; I clung for dear life to the stone pedestal; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brief second I seemed to lose consciousness, ami,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as before, the wind ceased, my brain cleared, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I raised myself from my recumbent position I al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most cried out in amazement. Before me. and resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">within six feet of where I stood, was the bluish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ovoid thing into which Doctor Mentiroso had van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished. It was incredible that he could have gone far</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the few brief seconds which had elapsed. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt, I thought, he had had trouble, or had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned for some other reason, and I momentarily ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected to see him emerge from the thing. So great</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been my excitement and confusion that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely forgotten to look at my watch. A glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed me, however, that less than one minute had</seg><seg type="columnLine">elapsed!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next second the slide in the machine opened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don Fenomeno's head appeared, and as I stared at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he sprang from the machine. As he did so, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden wave of darkness seemed to envelop me; I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the terrifying sensation of having gone blind;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with a sharp cry I put my hands to my eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly, it was full sunlight once more, my friend's</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh sounded in my ears, and I looked up to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">him standing beside me with a triumphant smile on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, what think you now, amigo mio?" he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think I'm mad," I replied. "Do you mean to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me---"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That I have again circumnavigated the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth?" he chuckled. "I certainly do, my friend.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But what time did I return?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At eleven thirty-one, if you actually did re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn," I replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And will you kindly glance at my watch?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great Scott!" I ejaculated. "Yours says 7.38!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Assuredly," was his calm response. "I returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my little jaunt approximately six minutes ago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or at 7.32 a.m. In other words, four hours before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I started, and we are now conversing easily although</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am in the past four hours while you are in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">present, or else 1 am in the present and you are four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours in the future."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sank limply upon a settee. "If you keep this up</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll be hopelessly mad, if I'm not already," I gasped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's all too involved for me and I believe it's some</seg><seg type="columnLine">devilish hallucination anyhow." *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you not see me start and return?" he asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Lord knows," I cried. "One instant your</seg><seg type="columnLine">contraption was gone, the next instant it was back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was nearly blown away by a cyclone. I seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be whirled topsy-turvey; I've been temporarily blind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I know it's absolutely preposterous for you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim that you flew around the earth in one minute."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Less than that," he corrected me.

Fleckner shook him roughly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when he was awake told him what had happened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he did not repeat the imputation he had hurled'</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me in the first excitement of his discovery.

My suspicions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the girl I kept to myself without knowing exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">why. Perhaps it was my consciousness of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">vagueness. Possibly it was natural chivalry. It may</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been the lingering appeal of a pair of violet</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. I suspect it was all three. At any rate I</seg><seg type="columnLine">contributed no suggestions of value, and neither of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the other two thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Stimson in connec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with the vanished van.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fleckner was inclined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancy some belated mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torist bad discovered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">van and salvaged it.

Her green shade was in place</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, so I caught no more glimpses of her disturbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. Fleckner greeted her rather curtly, and Priest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley with a politely impersonal inquiry as to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">health.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But we were immediately afterward engrossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Chandler's movements. He went back to town</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the 8.30 train, and at 9.30 was closeted alone in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his office in his town house. Immediately he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the telephone booth and turned one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret rings. Fleckner swung on the direction-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finder. and a moment later switched one telephono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope ray on the little private dining-room where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephone bell was ringing merrily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chandler, meantime, having started the call to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Riccadona, came out of the booth and began pacing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few minutes later a waiter at the cafe, passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the corridor, heard the bell in the private</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. He went in and pressed a button at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the instrument and the ringing ceased. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same instant the phone in Chandler's office gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">one sharp ring, evidently a signal that his call had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been noted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The waiter at the cafe hurried downstairs and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The other bell is ringing in No. 9," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and departed on his duties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cashier went into the phone booth back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and called up Judge Tanner at his chambers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is Tom," he said. "Your reservation for</seg><seg type="columnLine">No. 9 is O.

As a result</seg><seg type="columnLine">a swift airplane left an up-town hangar an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, its passenger an innocent-looking traveling</seg><seg type="columnLine">salesman for the New York Sun Motor Company.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He flew over Putnam County back and forth for</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours at a three-mile level, his plane blurred by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin screen of vapor, scouring the earth with a power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful field-glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the same time the New York State Agency for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Heatless Light Company decided suddenly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put its field force on for an intensive house to house</seg><seg type="columnLine">campaign in Putnam County. Every canvasser, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">records showed, was a member of the.criine trust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, during the day, word was sent in cipher to</seg><seg type="columnLine">every district representative in the country, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragnet was thoroughly set for the missing van.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile we, as well as the agents for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust, were scouring every edition of the papers for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a story of the finding of a mysterious van loaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with treasure. But the day passed without news,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the day lengthened into a fruitless week. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge took all his meals at the Riccadona, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">long conferences with Chandler, which brought them</seg><seg type="columnLine">nowhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During all this time the trust company continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing business without the slightest suspicion of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">loss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At length, on the eighth night after the disappear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of the van, Tanner got a call from a man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secret clubroom who was a new one to us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apparently, from the conversation that followed, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in charge of a section appointed to ferret out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and punish traitors. In the confusion of trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch all the complicated communications sent out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day after the robbery, we had evidently over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked this particular thread in the tangled skein.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We think we've located a traitor." this man de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared. "We haven't positive evidence, but it's pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong. We believe he knows nothing of what l)e-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came of the van later, but probably he had a griev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance and tipped off the State police, who nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the man sent to meet the van. We believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">the police are keeping the facts from the public,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoping to trap us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll call you back in a few minutes," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he switched to Chandler and reported.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you recommend?"

The execu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioner had taken from his pocket a small atomizer</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with a colorless fluid. Holding this in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand under his robe he casually walked up behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">his victim, and pretending to become absorbed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the game, placed the nozzle of the atomizer against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other's back and pressed the bulb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Carrying odors is the one thing the telephono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope won't do," Fleckner remarked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scent must have been a delicate one, for no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one about the billiard-table gave any signs of noting</seg><seg type="columnLine">an offensive odor.

The strange man turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and caught him before he fell. Just then a cab</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled up. A man stepped out and helped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other man put Mr. Priestley in the cab. Then they</seg><seg type="columnLine">both got in and drove away. I started to scream, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a policeman coming and knew I mustn't attract</seg><seg type="columnLine">the police. They'd kill Mr. Priestley right away</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they thought the police were after them.

But though we searched for the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night we accomplished nothing more than to verify</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Stimson's belief that the trust agents had</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed the telephone antenna connecting with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument in Gersten's apartment by the use of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high power wave sender which burned out the deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate connections. They had then evidently tuned</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own outlaw instrument into the same wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">length and, as she had surmised, answered his calls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We tried the expedient of calling up his number,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but apparently the listeners-in now suspected a trap</seg><seg type="columnLine">and refused to answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At half-past eight in the morning our screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed Judge Tanner appearing for breakfast in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the private dining-room at the Riccadona.

She motioned the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">girl to follow and they went cautiously out and up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a rear elevator that led directly into Chandler's study</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the top floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The girl sank in a chair and gazed raptlv about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her for some minutes. Finally she roused herself</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with an effort and glanced at her watch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh. 1 promised to phone a friend at ten!" she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed.

What her former connection with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">_ Chandler household had been I could not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">imagine, for the sinister suggestion made by Fleckner</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">somehow did not ring true. My instincts rebelled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">against it. Then there was the evident respect of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that manifestly conventional Mrs. Simmons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But another possibility Hashed into my mind. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">this girl all along been an agent of the crime trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">spying upon us? Would that account for the episode</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the treasure van? If so why had she not be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trayed us long before? On the other hand she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now evidently working against the organization. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">her devotion to Priestley, which I had been quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">noting, converted her to our side? I wondered if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Fleckner had thought of these startling</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibilities and what action he might take.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But be all that as it might, her quick feminine</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind had grasped a simple and direct plan of action</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she had the courage to carry it out promptly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We gasped in admiration at her boldness and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuity as we listened to the orders she was giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Judge Tanner over the secret telephone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've just got some important information about</seg><seg type="columnLine">our latest prisoner, young Priestley," she whispered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from Judge Tanner's expression it was evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was entirely deceived by the disguised voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He is refusing to give information about the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his crowd because he expects to lie rescued soon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had advance information somehow as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he was to lie hidden and they have a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our men spotted. We've got to make a quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">shift and get him in the hands of an entirely new</seg><seg type="columnLine">group that they're not yet wise to. My plan is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">let him escape and pull the old crowd off his trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether. Then while lie's free lie'll go straight to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his men. My new bunch of trailers will follow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll grab the whole gang. W'hat do you think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that scheme?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An excellent one!" Tanner agreed, enthusiastic-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">aI|y-,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "1 hat girl has a great head!" Fleckner exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"1 never half appreciated her before. But I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">&lt;|iiite understand it. I don't think I can ever trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">her again. She's too clever and women are flighty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">variable creatures at best. And there's been some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of tie between her and Chandler. That's evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fleckner was too absorbed in present happenings</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow out his reasoning but for me a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">light was shed on her hysterical performance which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had frightened Chandler away from the treasure van</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night just as lie was about to lead us to the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure. The girl. I was convinced, had acted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a purpose on that occasion. She had not wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chandler to guide us to the Treasures of Tantalus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was it sentiment for Chandler that prompted her</seg><seg type="columnLine">or had she an interest in the treasure itself? That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was what bothered me. At any rate, she seemed now</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be acting in our behalf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But was she? That was another question that</seg><seg type="columnLine">popped into my head a second later. Priestley, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leased from the trust, would be in her power. Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">he safe there? Or was the girl a deserter from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust and was now a member of a rival gang which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through her aid, had stolen the treasure van and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now cleverly using Professor Fleckner's great inven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion for its own ends?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That last fleeting suspicion seemed at that moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">so faitfastic that I instantly dismissed it and gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">my undivided attention to the screen again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is my plan," the girl was saying. "Follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely and act quicklv. There's no time to lose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">TREASURES OF TANTALUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">707</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Get your present attendants on Priestley out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way as far and fast and secretly as you can.

Have a new man bring him in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cab down to the Esplanade in Van Cortlandt Park,</seg><seg type="columnLine">arriving there exactly at noon. My new men will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">on hand to trail him to his gang.

Then have him untie Priestley</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turn him loose. Have the man drive away as</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly as possible. My other men will do the rest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tanner agreed without comment as was his custom</seg><seg type="columnLine">on getting commands from Chandler. His careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">repetition of the orders to his agent in the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground club made it evident that he suspected noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wrong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But again from there on we lost the trail in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion of multiple messages all in code. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, however, it was not important that we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace the orders further.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For promptly at noon, we enjoyed the immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief of seeing Miss Stimson's directions carried out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the letter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Van Cortlandt Park Esplanade, even in those days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thronged with noon-hour strollers from the fac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tories along its southern margin, and a steady stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of motors filled its roadways. Miss Stimson could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have chosen a better place in which to carry out</seg><seg type="columnLine">her scheme than this spot where any slightly unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurrence would pass unnoticed in the throng.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a half hour before the appointed time we swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">the locality with our ray, studying every loiterer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see if we recognized a known trust agent, but we</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to see any familiar face or suspicious character.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was exactly twelve o'clock when a cab, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been circling slowly around the Esplanade, drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and stopped for a moment in front of the Wright</seg><seg type="columnLine">statue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door opened and Priestley stepped out, a pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">and haggard Priestley, but with bearing undaunted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stood for a moment in front of the statue and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked about him suspiciously. The cab drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then he noticed Miss Stimson strolling to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the statue. She was dressed differently than</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the morning, but was still veiled. Catching sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Priestley, she stepped up to him briskly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good morning," she greeted him cheerily. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are a little late." Then she added quickly in an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dertone. "It's Miss Stimson. Don't look surprised.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're safe now but we can't be too careful."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Priestley rose to the occasion and checked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentary confusion with a laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't see you coming and you startled me," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I'm sorry I'm late. What can I do to atone?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can buy me a nice luncheon at Briarcliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inn. My car is right over here. I'm going to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">you how fast a real lady can drive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This debonair, easy-speaking young woman was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still another Miss Stimson to us. I realized more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever that the girl was a consummate actress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She led the way across to the parking station and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they entered a swift-looking little coupe. The girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">backed the car skilfully out of the line and it-glided</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly away northward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, just as we swung the rav forward to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speeding coupe a cab flashed on the other side</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the screen breaking all speed limits in defiance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the traffic officer at the southern entrance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esplanade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better throw on another ray and investigate that</seg><seg type="columnLine">cab," Professor Fleckner directed anxiously as he ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">justed the ray he was controlling, so that we might</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep a close-up of Miss Stimson's coupe on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I swung in a second ray and as I picked up the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terior of the cab, my instinctive fear was realized.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the cab which had brought Priestley to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wright statue just now, still driven by the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had released him. This man's face was a pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of desperate fear. Beside him sat another man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">registering both anger and alarm in his pugnacious</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenance. They were both straining their eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Miss Stimson's fleeing car into which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had evidently seen Priestley enter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The situation was as evident as though it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">told in words. Miss Stimson's haste had been justi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied. Somewhere along the line the crime trust's</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentarily deluded gang had discovered the trick</seg><seg type="columnLine">played on them. The second man in the pursuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">cab had evidently been sent in haste to undo the</seg><seg type="columnLine">error and arrived near the scene in time to meet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who had just released Priestley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And for the moment it seemed that Miss Stim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's clever artifice had been wasted. All uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious of pursuit, she was driving northward as fast"</seg><seg type="columnLine">as speed regulations permitted, but far too slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep ahead of the pursuing cab for more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crime trust's agent, in his desperation, hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed regulations to the winds. Pedestrians lied in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every direction. Vehicles shot toward the curbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the right and left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Warn the girl! I'll get a traffic officer after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cab!" I shouted to Fleckner above the tumult of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd and the snorting of motor-horns that filled our</seg><seg type="columnLine">little room from our sounding screen as though we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were actually on the edge of the throng.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fleckner projected his voice into the coupe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned the girl with a word, and in terror she threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">her car into full speed and shot out of the Esplanade</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a park road, with the swiftness of an airplane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At that she was barely holding her own against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly pursuing cab.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In less than a minute, some quarter of a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, I located a motor-cycle traffic-officer, trundling</seg><seg type="columnLine">his machine leisurely along, the speeders hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his sight by a clump of shrubbery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To avoid creating public consternation by a seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing miracle I projected my image among the bushes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seemed to step out of them into the path of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's a speeder playing havoc with the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">over there!" I shouted excitedly, pointing across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esplanade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without a question he jumped on his cycle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gone like a flash. Hopefully I drew my image</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into the bushes and cut off the projector. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">the officer should overhaul and arrest the driver of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cab, it would give our friends a chance after all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Breathlessly Fleckner and I followed the triple</seg><seg type="columnLine">race on our screen; the coupe slowly losing its lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the recklessly driven cab. but--thank Heaven!</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the motor-cycle gaining 011 it much more rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They left Van Cortlandt Park behind and flew up</seg><seg type="columnLine">768</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Yonkers Boulevard. A few minutes later they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were swinging perilously around the sharp curves</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Westchester Park'drives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meantime Miss Stimson, behind the screen of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">car top, had been ordering a lightning change act</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seemed rather futile under the circumstances.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Under her directions Priestley had hauled a feminine</seg><seg type="columnLine">outfit--cape, skirt, hat, veil and gloves--from under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seat and put them on over his own clothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without too close inspection he looked like a large-</seg><seg type="columnLine">framed middle-aged woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Stimson turned the wheel over to him while</seg><seg type="columnLine">she changed her own hat, veil and jacket for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">assortment of entirely different style. She looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen years older and a dowdy contrast to the trim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stylish figure of a few minutes before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She evidently hoped to get out of sight of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuers long enough to turn about and, in these</seg><seg type="columnLine">disguises, give them the slip. Fleckner heartened</seg><seg type="columnLine">her by telling her that the motor officer might give</seg><seg type="columnLine">her that chance, though a dubious one at best.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within five minutes that hope seemed about to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized. The motor-cycle drew along side the cab</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its rider signaled the driver to stop. Then our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes were dashed again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second man in the cab turned back his coat</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapel and, to our consternation, displayed the badge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a Central Office detective. He shouted something</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the motor-cycle officer and the latter, instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisting on stopping the cab, let his cycle's speed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">another notch and shot by in pursuit of the coupe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I3y invoking the aid of the law we had merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the capture of our friends doubly sure. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust had played the same game. It was only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of minutes now when the motor-cycle would</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtake them and Miss Stimson's pitiful little sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terfuge would avail them nothing. The pursuers</seg><seg type="columnLine">had long since noted the number and style of the car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But just as I was in despair, the genius of Fleck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner again came to the rescue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me handle your lever a minute, Blair," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed suddenly. "Get one of those spare lengths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of power cable out of the storeroom."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," he directed, when I had brought the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll containing about a rod of half-inch wire cable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"bend one end so it will hook over that window-</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch, then carry the other end across the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretching it in front of the screen. Til turn on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnifier and then project this cable so it appears</seg><seg type="columnLine">in image like a two-inch hawser stretched across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road in front of that motor-cycle and cab. That'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop 'em for a minute, I'll guarantee."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scheme worked. The motor-cycle and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cab flew around the bend and their drivers saw across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road a few rods ahead, what appeared to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy cable stretched taut at a height that meant a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure wrecking for both vehicles. Brakes screeched</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they came to a dead stop within two yards of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent obstruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All three men swore roundly and stared stupidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the cable. The speeding coupe in the meantime</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengthened its lead by a quarter of a mile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They've stopped," Fleckner told Miss Stimson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">again projecting his voice into the coupe. "Better</seg><seg type="columnLine">slip off on a by-path and trust to throwing them off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scent. They'll be on again in a moment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll do better than that," replied the girl calmly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She brought the car to a grinding halt, reversed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned squarely around. She threw over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lever beside the seat and the coupe top folded down</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of sight leaving the car looking like an ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">open roadster. Thereupon she pulled out false num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber plates from under the seat, hooked them over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old ones and was back in the car in barely a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the same instant the motor-cycle officer, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">by good chance had not yet attempted to touch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsubstantial cable image, started to shove his ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine under the obstruction to go on with the pursuit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Snatch it loose and pretend to run," Fleckner</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I jerked the end of the cable off the window-catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went through a pantomime of running.

Finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came to the point where they had dropped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed Central Office man.

We were chums in</seg><seg type="columnLine">college and for a time I was engaged to his sister,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but we broke the engagement by mutual agreement</seg><seg type="columnLine">and later she married Paul Tilford, another close</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend of mine.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">that instant I had a sudden dizzy feeling and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything went black. That's all I know about my</seg><seg type="columnLine">kidnaping.

There must be some way of rescuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">her!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll give myself up in exchange," Priestley de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared. "Let me at the instrument."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went to the switchboard of the telephonoscope</seg><seg type="columnLine">and threw over the control lever. Professor Fleck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner watched him with a sardonic smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But to our bewilderment nothing happened in re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponse to Priestley's manipulation of the levers. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen remained blank</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fleckner chuckled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It won't work, will it?" he taunted. "You see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have noted that you boys didn't quite approve of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my methods and might get rebellious. So while you</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept, I changed the combination of the instrument so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no one but me can work it hereafter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Furthermore, I had this apartment built over</seg><seg type="columnLine">some years ago when I began making secret inven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. I didn't propose to have my ideas stolen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Boors and windows have secret electric locks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel bars that thrust across them out of the interior</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the adjacent walls, so that it's as impossible to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">out as in. I've just pressed a secret button that puts</seg><seg type="columnLine">those locks in operation. I've also pressed another</seg><seg type="columnLine">button *hat put our phone out of commission and</seg><seg type="columnLine">another summoning James and his able assistant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here they are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Into the laboratory came James, the gigantic ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">athlete whom Fleckner employed as butler and valet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With him was another man equally competent-look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. from a physical standpoint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "James," said his employer, "some gentlemen on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outside are trying to get at our secrets or kidnap</seg><seg type="columnLine">us or both. I've told you a little about it already.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I've thrown all the outside locks and cut off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone. You may break the news to the cook. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">will get his regular food supplies up the delivery tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">as usual and send back a written order for each day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so we won't starve. These two young gentlemen arc</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends of mine, but don't quite agree with me just</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. Keep them under guard, especially while they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are in the laboratory. They'll have access to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their two bedrooms only. You take the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch and John the night watch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he turned to us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think I understand some things a little better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than you boys," he said. "I think I can guarantee</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Miss Stimson will suffer no serious harm be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore I rescue her.

We each picked up one and sat down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to read, not expecting much of interest in the news</seg><seg type="columnLine">that found its way into print. It served rather as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a welcome distraction from the tension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But on this particular morning, we found that, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of furnishing distraction, the news bore vitally</seg><seg type="columnLine">on our troubles.

Ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cording to the second article, a cousin of Priest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley's--evidently the one whose life we had saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Bolshevik outlaws on that Pacific island last</seg><seg type="columnLine">New Year's Eve--had just returned to civilization</seg><seg type="columnLine">after long isolation in the South Seas. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned for the first time that Thomas Priestley held</seg><seg type="columnLine">the family fortune by virtue of the signatures of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other descendants. Thereupon he had gone to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">district attorney's office and declared he had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed the release.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was significant that he fell into the hands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Assistant District Attorney Winter, accredited mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of the crime trust's inner councils. Winter in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigated the alleged signature of the returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">cousin on the release document, and his expert had</seg><seg type="columnLine">pronounced it a forgery. Moreover, it was shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">that on the date the signature was signed, December</seg><seg type="columnLine">31, 1999, the cousin was in the South Seas and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper had been filed long before it could possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">have reached New York from there. The reader</seg><seg type="columnLine">will remember that this cousin, like the other two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed the projected shadow of the release and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the signature was actually recorded by a photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graphic process on real paper in New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The grand jury being in session, an indictment</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been jammed through immediately and an order</seg><seg type="columnLine">for arrest obtained. Priestley, not being found in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his usual haunts and not having been seen there for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several days, a general alarm had been sent out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. A detective had seen him that noon getting into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a car with a heavily veiled young woman whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">identity was unknown. He had summoned help and</seg><seg type="columnLine">given chase.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a strange thing had happened, proof of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully worked out conspiracy. The story went on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell how the detectives had been foiled by a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">cable stretched across the road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a plausible tale and sensational in the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treme. It not only ruined Priestley's reputation, both</seg><seg type="columnLine">by direct statements and countless cleverly put and</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently inspired innuendoes, but from a legal stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">point seemed to present a pretty clear case against</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, that could be contested only by exposing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret of the telephonoscope, which in the present</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances would do more harm than good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Further than that, the only persons who could</seg><seg type="columnLine">testify as to the genuineness of the signature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Priestley's cousin, barring Fleckner, Priestley, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, had been kidnaped, so that nothing of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort would interfere with the trust's plans. I pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">this out to Fleckner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And in addition to that," I went on, "if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew enough about us to capture all the men who are</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the secret, they certainly know your connection</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it and will he after us at once. I only wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">they haven't been here already."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quite so," Fleckner agreed. "Their delay is prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably caused by the necessity for keeping such moves</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret. Well, we'll prove an alibi as far as this place</seg><seg type="columnLine">is concerned."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "James," he directed, "tell the cook to order</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough food staples sent up this morning to last</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a month, together with the canned and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated supplies we have on hand. Then you bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">a couple of trunks and a bag out here, and you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">John and the cook put on your own things and get</seg><seg type="columnLine">your valises. Then call up and have a big motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">hack down at the door in half an hour. Tell them</seg><seg type="columnLine">we want to catch the ten thirty at the Pennsylvania</seg><seg type="columnLine">Station."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Priestley looked up in amazed alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're not going to attempt to leave," he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed, "and keep me locked up here alone?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Keep your seat, Thomas," Fleckner reassured</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "I'm going to do nothing of the sort. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">management of the building and the crime trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleuths are simply going to think they see us depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Oh, by the way, James--also call up the super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">intendent and tell him we're going away for a month</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so, taking a trip down through the Andes or any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other remote place that sounds good to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A half-hour later Fleckner turned on the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phonoscope and got the front entrance of the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on the screen. The motor hack he had ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood waiting. Fleckner's two men brought one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trunks in front of the screen and went through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the motions of walking while the professor turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the projector and sent their images out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall down the elevator and out to the hack. He held</seg><seg type="columnLine">the image of the trunk in the hack, while, with an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other ray, he brought the images of the men back up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the laboratory to go through the motions with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other trunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then all four of us carrying bags were projected</seg><seg type="columnLine">in image down aboard the hack. Fleckner told the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chauffeur to draw down the curtains and drive to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pennsylvania Station. The professor kept our</seg><seg type="columnLine">images and those of the trunks and bags aboard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hack all the way to the station.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is on my account at the livery," he said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the driver on the hack's arrival at the station. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not, of course, satisfy the man with shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">money. "By the way, while I'm having the baggage</seg><seg type="columnLine">TREASURES OF TANTALUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">773</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">taken in, would you mind telephoning for me? I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">just time to catch the train. Call up the superin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendent of my building and tell him that my attorney,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Forsyth, will attend to my rent while I'm gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I forgot to tell him. Add a dollar for yourself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my bill."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This, of course, was mere by-play to get the driver</seg><seg type="columnLine">away long enough to dissolve our images without</seg><seg type="columnLine">causing him undue astonishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this time Fleckner had kept another ray play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about, watching for trailers of the hack, but if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trust had any emissaries watching our supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements we failed to catch them at it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," Fleckner said at last, "it looks as if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all snug and could defy the trust indefinitely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If they try breaking in here illegally, they'll get an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpleasant surprise. If they try invoking the law</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a permit to secure evidence, I have another</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As for your case, Priestley, don't worry about it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will arrange to have no further action taken on it</seg><seg type="columnLine">until you are caught, which will be never unless I</seg><seg type="columnLine">see fit. When we're good and ready, provided you</seg><seg type="columnLine">make me no more trouble, we'll clear your name in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such spectacular fashion that there'll be no doubt left</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the public mind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you mind telling us how you expect to ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complish all these marvels?" Priestley asked rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">sarcastically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll see, little by little," the professor replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">imperturbably. "From now on I am the real head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crime trust, I'm going to rule with a lightning</seg><seg type="columnLine">rod. I'm going to stand it on its head. And all not</seg><seg type="columnLine">without profit to myself. For the Treasure of Tan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">talus is mine to have and to hold."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Priestley and I remained silent. We had learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">by now the unwisdom of arguing with him. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a wild, almost mad, gleam in the old man's eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wondered if the vision of too much power had</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbalanced his reason. Or had we, in our desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">root the hidden criminals from society, put ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hands of a master criminal ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Priestley and I often discussed these questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously between ourselves during the coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks when we were alone together in one of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms and were sure the old man was preoccupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as the days went, evidence piled up that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">old genius who had so enthusiastically started on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunt for high-grade defectives, had himself devel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oped a defective streak. I began to wonder more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever who of us was immune from this obscure</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental malady. There were times when I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself applying tests to myself to see if I was mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally normal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All that day, after Fleckner had put his house in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order for a possible siege, he sat by his desk in deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, now and then making notes on a pad. Dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that 'time he made no use at all of the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phonoscope. PTe was evidently, as we came to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, planning out the details of one of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambitious bids for power that the world has ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">known, a campaign that had for its aim the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jection of society, holding its privacy for ransom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At six o'clock that evening he sprang suddenly into</seg><seg type="columnLine">action. He retired to his bedroom for a moment, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he returned, we were amazed to see him attired</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a black robe and mask like those worn in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crime trust's secret clubroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to pay some of my new subjects a</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit," he remarked casually as he sat down at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephonoscope switchboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He then switched on the ray by a new and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicated combination device of which we could make</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing, though we watched closely. At once the</seg><seg type="columnLine">private dining-room at the Riccadona was on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen. Then we sat and waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A half-hour later Judge Tanner, Dorgan and Win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter entered. They removed their overcoats and sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. They had just turned to their menu cards</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Professor Fleckner arose, turned on his pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jector, and clapped his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The trio of rascals at the little table miles away</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped to their feet in startled amazement just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy draperies of one of the windows seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">melt silently into the frames and a black-robed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">masked figure stepped off the sill and stood before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pray, sit down, gentlemen. Don't be alarmed,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he commanded in a good imitation of the hoarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper Tanner had heard so many times over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret telephone circuit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three obeyed, pale and shaken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am the Man Higher Up, before you in person</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last," announced the apparition solemnly. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never expected to give you a personal interview here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You remember I said to you, Judge Tanner, on elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion night, that I would like very much to thank yon</seg><seg type="columnLine">in person, but that it was not possible. You and Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorgan made it clear when you initiated Mr. Winter</seg><seg type="columnLine">here that it wasn't done."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three winced at hearing their names pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced in this offhand manner.

"Somewhere in this carefully worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out organization, a leak has sprung.

Priestley and I, as well as the three uneasy</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures around the table in the little dining-room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited breathlessly for his reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was not quick to make it. For some moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stood in silence, evidently debating how he should</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet this unexpected situation. At length he spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemnly, deliberately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It has been our policy neither to affirm nor to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deny guesses as to the identity of any of our mem-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bers, but to punish swiftly those who venture to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">guess. This case is different. I feel that I should set</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I am troubled to know that young Priestley has</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">learned so much as to guess rightly at the existence</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of our secret organization, and that we are interested</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in Mortimer Chandler, whom for our purposes, we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have put up for President of the United States. For</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the rest of his delirious statement, while he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">buried alive and under nerve racking torture, it's at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">most a very bad guess. Chandler and I are not one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the same person at all, nor does he even dream</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">who I am. I am head of the crime trust, as our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">prisoner was pleased to call it. Therefore Chandler</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is not. That's all for now. Follow my instructions,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and I'll appoint another meeting soon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  His image backed to the window. Again the drap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eries seemed to melt and he vanished, lie threw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">off the projector, snatched off his black mask, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turned to us, wiping beads of sweat from his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well," he remarked with great satisfaction, "I've</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spiked Chandler's guns and found out what I wanted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to know.. The gentlemen of the crime trust haven't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">learned a thing about the telephonoscope, and never</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will, for every one who knows anything about it is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">safely out of their reach."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But," Priestley protested in bewilderment, "what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about Miss Stimson and the twelve men who were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">present at the demonstration on New Year's Eve? I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thought we were satisfied they were in the power of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the trust ? Have they escaped ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You mean you were satisfied," Fleckner chuckled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">. "I might as well tell you about that now. They have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not escaped. They were never kidnaped by the trust,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for the simple reason that I took good care that they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shouldn't be by kidnaping them first myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What!" I exclaimed. "Do you mean to say that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all this time you have known where Miss Stimson</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Exactly," he agreed. "Miss Stimson never left</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this building that night I said I sent her home while</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you and Priestley slept, nor has she since. She is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">perfectly safe and comfortable, though rather closely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">confined. You see, I rent four adjoining apartments</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in this house. The twelve missing gentlemen are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">here also. Ten of them came unsuspectingly in re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sponse to my telephone invitation, of which the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">papers spoke; the other two dallied, so they had to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be carried here by my two men, James and John,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">incidents which the papers also told about luridly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The safety of all of us depended on such precautions,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to say nothing of the success of my future plans.'"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The feelings of Priestley and mvself were too</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mixed to allow us to speak. We stared at the pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fessor in amazed silence. Then another suggestion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">intruded itself in my mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "And the disappearance of the two-million-dollar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">treasure van after Chandler was scared off? Was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that also engineered by you?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Exactly," he agreed. "When we were watching</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Chandler on his way to meet the treasure van, I had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">John and James--who, by the way. are expert aero-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nauts--in a swift plane of mine in my hangar on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the roof of this building, ready to fly to the spot the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">moment Chandler revealed to us the hiding-place of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the main treasure. When I saw there was no hope</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that Chandler or any agent of his would dare try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">TREASURES OF TANTALUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">775</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">go back to the van after he was frightened by Miss</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Stimson, I decided I wouldn't let an unclaimed treas-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ure, even a paltry two million dollars, lie around idle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">So after you and Priestley were asleep, I directed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the boys to fly out and retrieve the van and take it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to a good hiding-place of my own, where it now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lies safe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This boasting confession, too, Priestley and I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived in silence. I remember wondering at this in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Priestley's case, such a sharp contrast to his usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehement protests against Fleckner's doubtful meth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ods, which now had passed quite beyond the doubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful stage. I was disturbed, too, by my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquiescence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I no longer had any doubts that Fleckner had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed into the ranks of pronounced criminal defec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives. What disturbed me almost as much was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear that Priestley and myself were to some degree</seg><seg type="columnLine">infected with the germs of the same defectiveness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Fleckner was now busy with further</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans. After consulting his notes and spending a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes in thought, he turned again to the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phonoscope control board and brought the home of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mortimer Chandler on the screen. Chandler was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown alone in his study hard at work over some</seg><seg type="columnLine">reports. A hasty search about the house with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays made it apparent that the family and his secre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary were out for the evening. The servants were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their own quarters in a distant part of the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A very opportune moment for visiting my prede-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessor on the crime trust throne and letting him</seg><seg type="columnLine">know he is out of office." chuckled the professor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Also, I may add, this is the evening in which I take</seg><seg type="columnLine">over officially, the custody of the Treasures of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tantalus."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He slipped on his black mask again, got a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic pistol from the storeroom, which he held</seg><seg type="columnLine">conspicuously before him, stepped in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen, and threw on the projector.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHANDLER, bent over the papers at his desk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a soft step and looked up to find himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">face to face with the black-robed, masked image that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had so startled the council of three a little while</seg><seg type="columnLine">before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The President-elect leaped to his feet, his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing amazement and anger, rather than fright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who the devil are you, and how did you get in?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quiet! Stand where you are! Don't press any</seg><seg type="columnLine">call-buttons! If any one finds us together you'll die</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, he next!" Fleckner rapped out. "Sit down</seg><seg type="columnLine">over in that chair, out of reach of push-buttons."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chandler obeyed, as any reasonable man would.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he still showed no sign of fear. He already</seg><seg type="columnLine">had himself in hand and was eyeing the apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">intruder coolv.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's better," the apparition went on. "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be alarmed. You won't suffer the slightest harm if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are reasonable, as you will be, I'm sure, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've shown you that your life and reputation are</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely in my hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, as to your questions. To answer the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond one first; I got in by a method I shall use often</seg><seg type="columnLine">from now on, for it will be necessary for us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">confer frequently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And who am I? Well, we don't name names</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a rule, in our organization, do we? I'll just keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine to myself, as you have kept yours till now. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am, however, a member of the secret organization of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which you have been the head, a member who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not afraid to use his brains and inquire into things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of blindly taking orders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have located you, for instance, and can expose</seg><seg type="columnLine">you at will if I choose. I know the machinery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the organization from A to Z. I have in my pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">session a complete list of the members and records</seg><seg type="columnLine">of every order you have issued for a year back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where you have allowed a leak to break out in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">system which nearjy wrecked it, I have found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leak, stopped it, and altered the system so that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can no longer handle it and I can.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In short, I am the new head of the organization</seg><seg type="columnLine">and have come here tonight to announce my as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumption of leadership and offer to retain you as</seg><seg type="columnLine">my first lieutenant, provided you are amenable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My admiration for the poise of Chandler increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I watched him while Fleckner pronounced this</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable mixture of truth and fiction. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the slightest flicker of expression in his face as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is very interesting!" he said, with sneering</seg><seg type="columnLine">emphasis. "Some secret fraternity, I suppose, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this is the rather original and startling method of</seg><seg type="columnLine">installing a new officer. I fancy you had a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much to drink and got in the wrong house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Otherwise, I haven't the remotest notion of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are talking about. Now, just go out quietly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way you came, and we'll overlook it this time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fleckner's answer was to draw a packet of photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graphic prints from a pocket of his robe. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">counterfeit image seemed to lay them on Chandler's</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, at the same time keeping the automatic ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the other hand. He picked up the prints one</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one and held them before Chandler's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a photograph of Chandler in his tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone booth followed by a close-up of the mechanism</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the secret circuit and a picture of the council of</seg><seg type="columnLine">three in the private room at the Riccadona, Judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tanner at the phone taking Chandler's orders. Sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral views of the underground clubroom followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were photos of the robbing of the trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">company, showing Chandler's part in it from start to</seg><seg type="columnLine">finish. There were views of the counterfeiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant under the cotton mill at Fall River, and others</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing how the bogus money reached Chandler.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a pretty complete and unanswerable argu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Chandler's eyes widened a little as he watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pictured story unfold. But otherwise he showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no signs of emotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now.'' Fleckner announced as he slipped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prints back in his pocket, "in addition to this I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">phonograph records of the conversation that went</seg><seg type="columnLine">with these photographs, so there isn't much evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacking. I have other photos, too, if you aren't sat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isfied yet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must be brief and get away before I am inter- .</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted," he went on, when Chandler made no sign.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"In a nutshell, the situation is this: I have learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the system by which you held your power*. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone ends your usefulness as head of the organiza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Further, certain outsiders began to get a clue</seg><seg type="columnLine">to your system of communication with subordinates.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You know that already. That renders that system</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless. I've therefore been around and established</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new system, which I know and you don't. I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained to the leaders that the old is unsafe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">776</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that they must acknowledge no more orders over</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. So you are entirely cut off and heipiess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Still further, I have built up my own secret inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle of assistants within the organization and</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken up yours, as you will learn if you try to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more orders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, not a man but you and me know that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">headship of the organization has changed.

You will be surprised to learn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, that one of your recent prisoners knew you</seg><seg type="columnLine">by name for the head of the organization, and under</seg><seg type="columnLine">torture told it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time Chandler showed signs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought that would startle you," Fleckner</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed. "Well, don't worry as lpng as you obey</seg><seg type="columnLine">ine. I have assured them the prisoner was crazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and altogether in error. Meantime I have put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow where he will do no harm unless I choose. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark me. If you are rebellious, I have only to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose you and the old machinery you controlled, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">go right on with the new one I have created. Will</seg><seg type="columnLine">you act as assistant and obedient adviser to me, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">face disgrace and residence at Ossining Farm?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chandler stood in thought for some moments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was now controlling his emotions with evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have me," he admitted at last.

But I defy any mortal man to have read</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the mask of stone that was Chandler's face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether he was risking his last vestige of power and</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-respect on a roval flush or a pure bluff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fleckner, uncertain, wavered and lost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well," he said at length.

He made no attempt to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">it or to investigate how this supposedly material</seg><seg type="columnLine">being had gained entrance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead he sank into his chair, and for an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat, bowed head in his hands, his iron self-control</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned once he believed himself without an audi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence.

And all these infernal ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tivities, Priestley and I knew, emanated from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind of Professor Fleckner through the control-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board of his miraculous telephonoscope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the mean time this evil wonder-worker was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reported as being seen and interviewed in various</seg><seg type="columnLine">sections of South America, through which continent</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was believed to be making an airplane tour. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">crafty professor thus maintained an alibi by pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jecting his image to one of those points every few</seg><seg type="columnLine">days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He no longer took us into his confidence. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no objection to our watching his screen when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we wished, but some of his most spectacular coups</seg><seg type="columnLine">were performed while we slept. We followed them</seg><seg type="columnLine">mainly through the sensational newspaper stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">that appeared each morning. For the papers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">TREASURES OF TANTALUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">777</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">delivered through the tul&gt;e regularly.

Hardly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning passed in which the papers did not feature</seg><seg type="columnLine">a series of widely scattered bank hauls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A rival inventor of Fleckner's, Dr. Hayward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bernstorm, was manufacturing a superior quality of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dye by a secret process which he had not entrusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the patent office. Only the inventor knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vital part of the ingredients, administering the final</seg><seg type="columnLine">touches with his own hand to each batch of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">product. The only written formula lay in a safe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deposit vault in one of New York's most substantial</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks. Yet, suddenly, another chemical concern, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I happened to know Fleckner was a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">stockholder, began to manufacture the dye by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same process. The owner of the secret sued the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank for allowing access to the safety-deposit box</seg><seg type="columnLine">by an unauthorized person.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the secret formula was found intact and</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently undisturbed, and there was no valid evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence that any one but its owner had seen it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit was lost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man, prominent in New York social and finan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cial circles, made a scurrilous and, as it turned out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistaken statement about a business rival. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made only to the maker's wife in strictest confidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the privacy of their apartments. The next day</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was sued for slander. The complainant stated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in court that an unknown stranger had stepped up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him on the street and quoted the slanderous re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark. Even the wife of the defendant, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">voluntarily, though weeping and reluctant, appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the stand and corroborated the evidence against</seg><seg type="columnLine">her husband.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She explained that she did so because she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">received an anonymous letter threatening that if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">refused, an unfortunate, but supposedly secret, inci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent in her own recent career would be exposed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No evidence, as to who this mysterious blackmailer</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, appeared, of course, but Fleckner reminded us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he chuckled over the newspaper account, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">defendant in the slander suit had once disputed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the papers a public statement of the professor's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In similar fashion Fleckner vented his personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">spleen in many directions. In other instances he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have no personal interest other than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratification of his whimsical humor or a display of</seg><seg type="columnLine">power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THUS when a serious dispute arose between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shop Council of Employees and the manage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the United States Airplane Company, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">side held a series of secret conferences in its efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get the best of the other. That is why they tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold secret conferences. Unfortunately the pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers each morning published detailed reports of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meetings of each side. As a result, each organiza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was ruptured by a wrangle in which every one</seg><seg type="columnLine">accused every one else of breaking faith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was panic in the political world when, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">each secret caucus of party leaders preparatory to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">organizing the coming Congress, the papers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other parties published full reports of the proceed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And these mysterious revelations of secrets spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">to international circles. The plottings of a circle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berlin royalists, w'ho aimed to restore the German</seg><seg type="columnLine">monarchy, was revealed to the republican govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment just before the coup was to be sprung. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other hand, the minutes of the executive sessions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Council of the League of Nations suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to be printed in full in the papers without any</seg><seg type="columnLine">official sanction, and as a result, an effort to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain delicate readjustments in the Far East in</seg><seg type="columnLine">favor of Japan, had to be abandoned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such are only a few of thousands of incidents</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked at random from the reign of terror that</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompanied these mad attacks on the privacy of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. Of course some good did spring out of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil. Certain revelations of business and political</seg><seg type="columnLine">chicanery resulted in making business men and poli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticians alike more straightforward in their dealings</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a long time to come, when it finally dawned on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the public that some mysterious spy system w'as ren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering thick walls, distance, and darkness of no avail</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the keeping of secrets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A newspaper humorist revived the fable of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">■'Little Black Man" who went about prying and tell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing secrets. Presently it ceased to be a joke. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sophisticated were convinced that some clever black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mailing agency was at work. Those inclined to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">superstitious became positively so. All shared in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic. No man knew when his most secret act or</seg><seg type="columnLine">word might not be publicly quoted to his detriment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men lost confidence in banks and in business en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terprises as the secret drain into Professor Fleckner's</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffers continued unchecked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As this proceeded I continued to wonder vaguely</seg><seg type="columnLine">why Priestley and I were no more actively indignant</seg><seg type="columnLine">at what we witnessed; or why we were not earnestly</seg><seg type="columnLine">plotting measures to thwart this new archvillain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Priestley shared my wonder in the same vague way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we discussed it occasionally in half-hearted fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion. We seemed to sleep or doze heavily most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time and to be in a semistupor even when awake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE day, while we two were at luncheon to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether. Priestley accidentally upset his cup of</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee before he had tasted it. He wiped up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mess, and did not ask James, who waited on us, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">another cup. That afternoon, instead of dozing</seg><seg type="columnLine">about in his chair as usual, and as I did, he was wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">awake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked restlessly about and chaffed me for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowsiness. Late in the afternoon he paused in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of my chair as I roused myself from one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my frequent naps, and declared that he'd give a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the Treasure of Tantalus for the cup of</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee he had spilled at noon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I never realized what a slave I had become to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that drink!" he complained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I showed no interest in his habits. Suddenly his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face lighted. He shook me by the shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wake up and listen!" he exclaimed. "I've got it</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. They've put drugs in our coffee right along</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep us doped and tractable!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that proved to be the truth. After that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">emptied our coffee cups in our wash-bowls when our</seg><seg type="columnLine">attendant was out of the room. And straightway</seg><seg type="columnLine">778</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">our chronic drowsiness and lack of moral sensitive-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness vanished. We took good care to conceal this</seg><seg type="columnLine">change from Fleckner and to watch his manipula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of the revised crime trust machinery with re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">newed interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor had now wearied of bank robberies</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was using the crime trust agents as collectors</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a continuous series of blackmailing enterprises.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With his malicious rays he followed the sun around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the globe, keeping all the civilized world in constant</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In addition, he was steadily widening the influence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his agents in the big business corporations of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world by crafty use of his knowledge of inside his-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory. He alternated this with busy schemes for pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moting liberal legislation in the parliaments of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world and in the Council of the League of Nations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was wielding a power such as Chandler in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildest moments never dreamed of.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for the President-elect of our country, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">destined for some time to hold no more conferences</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the black-robed phantom that had usurped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. That first visitation had been too much for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Chandler took to his bed next day with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">severe attack of nervous prostration and eventually</seg><seg type="columnLine">was declared physically impotent to assume the office</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which he had been elected. Hence, on March 4,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vice-President Horace Kildare was inaugurated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This turn of events irritated Fleckner the more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He intended wresting from Chandler the details of</seg><seg type="columnLine">how he turned the loot of the trust over to the real</seg><seg type="columnLine">custodian of the treasure, and from that starting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">point he would trace down its hiding-place and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper. For in the midst of all his multifarious</seg><seg type="columnLine">activities Fleckner never lost sight of his chief object,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get his clutches upon that enormous accumulation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of years of successful plunder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One evening, shortly after inauguration, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Priestley and I were alone in my room and had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain that the professor was busy manipulating</seg><seg type="columnLine">society, Priestley confided to me that he had at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">deciphered the new combination of the telephono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope at work, by cautiously watching Fleckner at</seg><seg type="columnLine">work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll get a chance some day before long to use it,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "I'm going to end all this. I'll connect</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the district attorney and tell our storv. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I do sacrifice myself and my fortune? This can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">go on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far into the night we discussed plans for carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">out this scheme. The main difficulty was to get at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the telephonoscope without being blocked by Fleck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner or one of his two men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chance came by mere accident a week later.</seg><seg type="columnLine">James, who had the watch at the time, had brought in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dinner trays for all four of us. Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved to be missing, and he returned to the kitchen</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it. Fleckner at the moment was bent over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes with his back to us. Priestley, acting on sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den inspiration, reached over and quietly changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">our coffee cups around. That evening Fleckner and</seg><seg type="columnLine">James drank the drugged coffee. Half an hour later</seg><seg type="columnLine">the worthy pair were asleep in their chairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At length Priestley, after testing the soundness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their slumbers, went triumphantly to the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">board of the telephonoscope, successfully worked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">combination, and a moment later the screen glowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the ray in full action. Then he seized the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">directing lever and turned the ray in the direction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the home of the .district attorney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now for the end of the crime trust!" he whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered excitedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Voice From Nowhere</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE district attorney of New York County</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived in a handsome apartment in upper River</seg><seg type="columnLine">side Drive. The brilliant lights of that thor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oughfare flashed across the screen as Priestley ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ray along the higher house numbers until he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the one he sought. Then, just inside, he pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected his own image and advanced it across the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapestried hall to the desk, and announced that Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thomas Priestley wished to see the district1 attorney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hall attendant got the sensation of his life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a reader of the newspapers.

The young man stared at Priestley incredu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lously for a moment, then gathered his wits, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a frightened voice announced the visitor through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the phone. After an awe-struck moment, he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported to Priestley that the district attorney wa5 in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and would see him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eightieth floor, apartment twenty-" he began;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but his voice was drowned as far as we were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerned by a sudden whirring roar. The screen went</seg><seg type="columnLine">blank, save for a pale yellow glow that showed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray was still on but that it was registering no images.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The roar penetrated even Fleckner's drugged con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness, and he awoke with a start.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's this? What's this?" he demanded, jump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up. "What are you boys doing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The machine seems to have run wild.

Who</seg><seg type="columnLine">did that?" Fleckner demanded, leaping for the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol-board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must have left it on when you went to sleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found it that way when I heard the roar and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of my room," Priestley ventured, ably seconding</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mendacious efforts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now Fleckner was struggling with the levers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for the time paid no attention to us.

He seemed to find no</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. Then he threw on the power again, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring was renewed. Again the screen glowed pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow. lie tried manipulating the ray, but got no</seg><seg type="columnLine">results.

For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment it became an intense white light, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly dimmed till it resembled the last faint flush</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a sunset afterglow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fleckner had for the moment given up his investi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gation, at a loss what to do next. We sat, all four</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us, staring curiously at the screen which, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing our bidding sc) long, had suddenly turned rebel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then into the hushed stillness of the room there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from the screen the sound of a human voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a soft, girlish voice of ineffable sweetness singing</seg><seg type="columnLine">an eery, haunting melody.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For long moments we sat breathless, enchanted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The song rose and fell, now near, now distant, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">music borne over wide waters 011 a fitful breeze. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunts me yet, after all these years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I make no attempt to reproduce it here. None of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us were musically trained. We kept a phonographic</seg><seg type="columnLine">record of it, but musical composers who have since</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened to that record found that the melody did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">conform to conventional scales, and it defied their</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts to record it on paper and reproduce it from</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes with anything approximating the original ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect. The words, too, though pronounced slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with beautifully clear enunciation, meant noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to us, and their syllables defied all attempts to</seg><seg type="columnLine">record them by any alphabetical symbols with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were familiar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT meantime our efforts were bent on trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">locate the strange singer. In this Priestley and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I took a lively interest. On our part it was in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure idle curiosity, and relief at this welcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">change from the sordid drama we had been witness-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, an anodyne to our disappointment at not being</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to communicate with the outside world. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">more particularly, we were enthralled by that voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">and consumed with desire to see the singer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet, mingled with that desire, I was conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a certain dread of the revelation. I do not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it be possible for a man to fall genuinely in love</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a woman from having merely heard her voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have never made a study of the amorous psychol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ogy of the blind. But I do know that the voice of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this strange woman moved me deeply and I dreaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing her face lest it destroy the illusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Priestley and I exchanged no confessions on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">score, but I noted, with a foolish feeling almost akin</seg><seg type="columnLine">to jealousy, that his manner indicated a feeling even</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger than mine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought suddenly of Miss Stimson and became</seg><seg type="columnLine">perversely indignant at him. I have admitted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my momentary glimpse of the violet eyes of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">young woman had intrigued my susceptible and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather fickle heart. My admiration for her sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequent conduct had deepened the sentiment dan-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gerously. I had tried to stifle it, however, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced that her heart was pledged to unrequited</seg><seg type="columnLine">affection for Priestley. I had believed that he held</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her no feeling but a kind of impersonal gratitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">for saving his life. Plis ready interest in the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this unknown young woman made me sure of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, as I say, I was unreasonably indignant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But while we youngsters were thus mooning about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room, Fleckner, forgetting for a moment all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sordid and utilitarian considerations, was lost in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem of pure science.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This pet invention of his, of whose every whim</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had supposed himself master, had suddenly dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">played a new trait. Fie must learn its secret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dominion of the world and the Treasure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tantalus could wait. Once more, for the moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the master criminal was the calm, cold devotee of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intellect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The song ceased a few minutes after we first</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard it, but the light stayed on the screen, showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the ray was still active. And it seemed to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main focused on one region, for at intervals through-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the day we heard the song again, now far and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now near, but always the same words. Once when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the song came from a point so close to the fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground of the ray focus that it seemed the singer</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be in the room itself just behind the screen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the singer stopped abruptly in the midst of the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">frain. Then, in a melodious speaking voice, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">pronounced a few rapid words. She was answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a heavy, though not unpleasant masculine tone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A lively dialogue followed for a few minutes, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's most baffling," Fleckner admitted. "I pride</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself on my knowledge of languages, but I catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">no syllable that seems to bear any relation to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">European family of tongues."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Means nothing to me, either," Priestley declared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've picked up, in my travels, a smattering of vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous dialects among the American Indians, the Afri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can and Mongolian tribes, but I catch no familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound. Of course, my knowledge covers only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute fraction of the known dialects."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can prove nothing by me," I declared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"English, French, and Spanish sum me up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> James, the muscular, contributed nothing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolid silence. The drugged coffee was still troub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling him a little. Anyhow, acts and not words were</seg><seg type="columnLine">his specialty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As for trying to locate this thing by any known</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical test," Fleckner went on, "I'm completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumped. I don't want to take the machine to pieces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fear of losing the connection for good, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to locate that language as a matter of curiosity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My range and distance indicators register nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all. I can't understand it. I'm simply going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch developments for a while. Perhaps something</seg><seg type="columnLine">will appear on the screen that will give us a clue."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And late that evening, just as we were about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give up and retire for the night, his patience was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rewarded. Priestley and I had already gone to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms when Fleckner, who had taken one last look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the screen before settling back in his chair for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nap, suddenly shouted out excitedly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something's happening! Come out here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We ran out and looked at the screen, which a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment before had been showing only a faint green-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish yellow. It now glowed with a clear white light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">780</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">excepting for faint shadings here and there which</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently began to take definite form. In a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments more the slowly developing screen showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interior of a big open room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We seemed to be looking down the broad aisle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a warehouse. On the right of the aisle was a row</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bins full of something that looked like coarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravel. On the left was piled high a long tier of</seg><seg type="columnLine">slabs, apparently some sort of building material,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped something like old-fashioned bricks, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger. We saw it all dimly as through a thin haze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We studied this picture curiously, trying in vain</seg><seg type="columnLine">to determine in what obscure corner of the world it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be. Suddenly the misty obscuration of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision cleared and we saw it all plainly. The con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tents of the nearest bin and the end of the long tiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bricks stood out in bold relief. A moment we</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed at it wonderingly. Then Fleckner jumped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet and shouted :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Treasure of Tantalus at last!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The supposed gravel pebbles were precious stones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions on millions of them glittering and shimmer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with fairy light! The bricks were of solid gold !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Singer Revealed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE could be no doubt of it. By this</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange, fortuitous accident we had been per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted to peer in to a treasure-house stored</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fabulous wealth. Fleckner verified our first</seg><seg type="columnLine">judgment of the material in the bins and bricks by</seg><seg type="columnLine">applying the new reflective spectrum test which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had invented. Not only were the supplies of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">most precious materials in the big storehouse," but we</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered that the building itself was made of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bricks and slabs and girders of gold. The floor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a priceless concrete of jewels bedded in golden ce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here indeed, it seemed, was moral defectiveness</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed into madness! Chandler, or the alleged man</seg><seg type="columnLine">above him who received the crime trust's treasure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had apparently converted the vast stores of the or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ganization's stolen wealth into this fantastic, mate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rialized dream of grandeur rivaling the ancient con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ception of a golden hereafter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But where was this trove ? Of its location we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">as ignorant as ever. It was more than before, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">Treasure of Tantalus, lying in plain sight, but as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as ever out of our reach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had ceased to be an academic problem with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Fleckner. Gone was the calm concentra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the scientist and man of pure intellect. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">his place was again the feverish, avaricious searcher</seg><seg type="columnLine">for hidden riches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back and forth across the laboratory he paced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">never taking his eyes from the maddening picture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gleaming treasure and cudgeling his brain in vain</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some method he had not yet tried for determin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing where the end of our magic ray rested. So the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night wore away. Priestley and I dozed at intervals</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our chairs. Morning came and we ate breakfast in</seg><seg type="columnLine">moody silence. The mystery was beginning to bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly there broke again that eery song.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we could only determine the language or</seg><seg type="columnLine">dialect she's singing, we might locate the general</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter of the globe in which your treasure lies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Priestley ventured. "Pity we don't dare invite in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some language experts to identify it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fleckner stopped short and clapped his hands to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether in glee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An idea!" he exclaimed. "Good for you, Priest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley! We can't bring the experts to us, but we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">take our mysterious song to them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Priestley and I looked at each other in alarm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">During all the reign of terror he had inspired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fleckner had never been so presumptuous as to ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear 'outside his apartment or to abandon for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment the pretense that he was traveling in South</seg><seg type="columnLine">America. Secure as was his secret hold on the crime</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust and through it upon the machinery of the law,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was still entirely possible that some person or per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons unknown to us might connect him with Priest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley, and the general public was still clamoring for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the capture of Priestley and the twenty-million-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollar fortune he was believed to have fraudulently</seg><seg type="columnLine">diverted from the public treasury. Fleckner once</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught and held as a witness in the Priestley case</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have a hard job concealing any longer the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret of his telephonoscope and the universal havoc</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had wrought with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he was mad enough to propose calmly going</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth and exposing to various outsiders, one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">results of the use of that instrument.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT the old man was not mad enough to fail to</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice our alarm. I think in his preoccupation</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the pranks of his invention he had not realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">until now that his prisoner-guests were no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the drugged stupor in which he had been keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked sharply from one to the other of us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but naturally made no comment on our renewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental acuteness. I wondered uneasily if he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspect the tampering with the coffee, and shift the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drug to some other article of our diet, perhaps in</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger and more effective doses. I resolved at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first opportunity to warn Priestley that we must eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparingly of everything set before us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At any rate, he set our minds at rest as to his next</seg><seg type="columnLine">move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not going to expose us to any danger," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained. "Remember I'm still supposed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling in the Andes, and it will be perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">plausible that I should use a long-distance telephone</seg><seg type="columnLine">from there. Just watch me work and see how simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">and safe it is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While he was talking he must have pressed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret switch connecting up the apartment telephone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he now punched up a number on the call-board</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his desk phone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "May I speak with Dr. Bonstelle?" he asked after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I recognized the name of the head of the Lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guage Department of Columbia University, a world-</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous philologist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dr. Bonstelle ?" Fleckner continued in a moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is Professor Rufus Fleckner. You may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed by the papers up North that I'm taking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacation tour in the Andes Mountains. I'm calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">now from the City of Santa Brazos in northern</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chile. I've struck a curious phenomenon in your line</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wanted to get your opinion on it. J would like</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow it up before I leave the region so I am ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turing to consult you by long-distance phone. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">TREASURES OF TANTALUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">781</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">group of wandering minstrels, apparently a gipsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe, came down from the mountains yesterday and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a musical in the Plaza here. They sang for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most part in the Zingaro, or Spanish gipsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">dialect. But one young woman sang a little thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an utterly different tongue. Neither I nor any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the natives I interviewed--including Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">of several different tribes--who were about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Plaza, could find any resemblance in it to any fam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iliar tongue. I tried interviewing the gipsies, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">got only suspicious shrugs. They wouldn't let me get</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the girl herself. I made a phonographic record</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the song and would like to transmit it to you if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll put a phonograph in front of your receiver.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You can let the different men in your department</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a try at it in case it isn't at once familiar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apparently Dr. Bonstelle swallowed the story and</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily consented to the request, for Fleckner</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought out the song record, put it in a machine, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed it in front of his phone transmitter. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was forced to admire the consummate skill of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old liar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just a moment. Professor Fleckner," I said, plac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a cautious hand over our transmitter. "Why not</seg><seg type="columnLine">try him with the spoken dialogue, too? That might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be easier to read than the words of the song."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at me pityingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bright: idea!" he sneered. "It would be quite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">help in case they recognize this language, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation of our mysterious pair happened to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">away the story of the treasure!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pushed me away from the phone and I sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sided abashed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Dr. Bonstelle, after listening to the song and</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking a record of it, declared himself as much in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark as we. He recognized not a trace of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">semblance to any of the general families of lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guages. He agreed, however, to have the men of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">department try it out. Professor Fleckner arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to call him up in twenty-four hours and get his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon after Fleckner had completed these arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, there were further developments on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen. The picture began to sway back and forth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealing different sections of the golden ware-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, to grow dim and bright by spells.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor became nervous at this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope we aren't going to lose it now just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's a chance of solving the riddle. That's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exasperating part of being unable to control the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strument. I've proved this much, though. A ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">restrial current of electricity of tremendous power</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been set up by some seismic disturbance.

He was nearly ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to connect in these new units when something else</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened on the screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The swaying of the picture had been growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">more violent at intervals as the day passed. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly it shifted abruptly to the right. The interior</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the big building slid off the screen and left us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gasping in unljelieving amazement at what took its</seg><seg type="columnLine">place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We seemed to be gazing down the length of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad, deep canon.

She drew out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small,, irregular pebble, rusty black in color and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still kneeling, gazed at it raptly, with frequent repeti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of her little cry of delight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What this precious find could be we were unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to guess from the fleeting glimpse we got.

Around a clump</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shrubbery a man appeared. He was a tall, well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped figure clad in a simple tunic, skin-tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">trousers and sandals, all of the same golden fabric</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the girl's garments. His hair was a shade darker</seg><seg type="columnLine">than hers and fell uncut to his shoulders. He wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">likewise a long, untrimmed, yellow beard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cut of his features suggested a relationship</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the girl which his age and subsequent attitude to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward her clearly indicated to be that of father. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue eves of the father were cold steel, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's glowed with the warmth of a summer sky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Avarice was the keynote of his expression. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the same calculating gleam in his eyes that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had noted so often in the pale orbs of Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fleckner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood for a moment regarding the kneeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure curiously. Then he crept stealthily forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and peered over her shoulder. At sight of what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">held in her hand he uttered a harsh cry and seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">her by the arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She leaped to her feet and faced him with wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled eyes, shrinking back and clutching her</seg><seg type="columnLine">bauble to her bosom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The father held out his right hand commandingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and held her arm roughly with his left, speaking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">volley of harsh syllables.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment the girl hesitated and then reluctantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed over what she held. The man held it up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face and, with a grunt of satisfaction, thrust it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his tunic and strode away. The girl, as soon as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was out of sight, threw herself on the ground and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook with sobs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this time we had caught only a fleeting glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the object that had caused two people so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">agitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl was gradually getting her grief under</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">control when again a step sounded on the bank above</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. The bushes parted and a young man about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">own age stepped out. He was as perfect a speci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of masculine beauty as she was of the feminine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie was dressed in the same general style as her</seg><seg type="columnLine">father. His complexion also was fair and his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone with the idealism of healthy young man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He caught sight of the girl and ran toward her</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a cry of solicitude, arms outstretched. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambled to her feet in confusion and shrank back</seg><seg type="columnLine">blushing, but evidently not displeased at seeing him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seemed to ask her numerous questions, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which she replied in monosyllables. At length she</seg><seg type="columnLine">led him to the edge of the stream and, pointing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot where she had picked up the bauble, broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">into voluble speech. She was evidently telling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story of her find and of her father's action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young man knelt down eagerly and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">digging furiously in the shimmering sand. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a call from the bank above in the harsh</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice of the girl's father.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The girl started guiltily, spoke a low word to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth and, with an answering call to her father, ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly up the bank. The young man arose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked after the girl for a moment with an expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mixed affection and anger. Then he walked down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river shore and disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Though the little dell remained fixed on the screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some time after that, there were no more signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life manifested, and it finally faded to a barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceptible outline.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Fleckner took advantage of this interlude to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the building up of a higher power ray and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he worked, we debated the meaning of the scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had witnessed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For mv part I had become convinced that Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Fleckner was wide of the mark in believing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his errant rays had hit by accident on the crime</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust's treasure trove which we had hunted so long</seg><seg type="columnLine">in vain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we had found nothing more than the ware-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house full of treasure that we first sighted I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe you might be right," I admitted. "But when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw an entire grand canon made of solid gold and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jewels, I knew at once the crime trust could never</seg><seg type="columnLine">have stolen enough wealth for that even if their chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fantastically crazy enough to convert the bulk</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it into such unusable forms as mountains. More-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, there is no section of this part of the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">where such a huge freak could be hidden. It must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in some remote and comparatively unexplored</seg><seg type="columnLine">region of the South Polar continent made habitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">by escaping volcanic vapors. There is apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrated a great natural deposit of gold and rare</seg><seg type="columnLine">minerals."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think you are partly right and partly wrong."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fleckner countered. "I agree with you on the prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able remoteness of this region. I also agree with you</seg><seg type="columnLine">in saying that the mountains and soil we saw are a</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural phenomenon. But remoteness is no bar to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in an airplane. I think now Chandler told the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth when he said he turned the treasure over to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man still higher up and that the older man we saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the screen, father of the singing girl, is that man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I believe he discovered a remote tribe of attractive</seg><seg type="columnLine">barbarians in this golden valley while searching for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a place to keep his treasure. There he lives part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his time surrounded by wealth beyond his dreams</seg><seg type="columnLine">TREASURES OF TANTALUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">783</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and adds to it the stolen millions of the trust. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">not normal of course. But you note that a great mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gold was in bar form and the diamonds and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">jewels were stored in bins. Either that is some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wealth he has brought in or it is some ready to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken out and used in the outer world. Think of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power such wealth gives. We must find and control</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," Priestley agreed, 10 my surprise. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">must find it as soon as possible. It's time, Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fleckner, to call up Dr. Bonstelle again and see if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have located that language yet. There must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">no delay in tracing out this region."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seemed suddenly to be as greedily obsessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the idea of the treasure as was Fleckner him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fleckner agreed to this suggestion and got Bon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stelle on the telephone. They had a long conference,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mostly monosyllabi-., on Fleckner's side, from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gathered that the head of Columbia's language de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment could give us no aid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Neither he nor any one in his department can</seg><seg type="columnLine">make anything out of it," the professor reported</seg><seg type="columnLine">after he had hung up. "He gave me a long discourse</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the history and philosophy of language. The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">significance in what lie said was that certain funda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental sounds in the song could not possibly be re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced by any normal, human-speaking apparatus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The mystery seems deeper than ever."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fleckner turned back to his generators, and Priest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley, after standing for a moment in unseeing ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">straction, went to his room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sat for a few moments moodily ruminating on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strangeness of Priestley's attitude. Then, obey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a sudden impulse. I stepped over to his door. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood slightly ajar. I had no intention to eavesdrop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I started to knock, but at that moment I heard his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice within. He was pacing the floor and talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My little Treasure of Tantalus," he murmured.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Poor little girl: I must find her!

For my part the novelty of the thing had</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn off and I found my thoughts straying else-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where. I was wondering about the comfort of little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Stimson. hidden away in solitary confinement</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere in the big building. I resolved to speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">a word for her when at length Fleckner had com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted his reconstruction job and sat down for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute to rest before trying it out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you think, professor," I ventured, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're being a little unfair to Miss Stimson? She's</seg><seg type="columnLine">missing a most interesting spectacle. She was in on</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the forepart of our experiments and naturally has</seg><seg type="columnLine">great curiosity as to what is going on now. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">harm could she do in here, as long as she has no</seg><seg type="columnLine">communication with the outside?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's something in what you say," the old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed. "Besides she has a keen mind, as we've</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered and might be able to help us with sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestions. But it won't be necessary to have her in</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. There is a small portable telephonoscope equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment in the storeroom, one of my early experiments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll have John set it up in her room. She'll be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">then to watch in on our screen. I'll give her the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cinema films of what she's missed, too, so she can</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring the story up to date."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He called John and gave the order and assured</seg><seg type="columnLine">me presently that the young lady was now enjoying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same privileges of outlook as we were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The test of the additional ray units met with con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable success. When Fleckner switched them</seg><seg type="columnLine">011, the picture on the screen which a moment before</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been an indistinguishable blur, suddenly leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into clear relief. We were looking once more down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broad aisle of the big treasure warehouse. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side, as before, we saw the bins full of gems,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other the long piles of golden bricks. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, instead of being silent and lifeless, the scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one of the busiest human activity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Groups of short, thick-set men, clad only in</seg><seg type="columnLine">breech-cloths of gold net, were hard at work mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the treasure. These men were in sharp contrast</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the handsome specimens of manhood we had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready seen, not merely in the shape of their bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the lower intelligence of their countenances;</seg><seg type="columnLine">their skins were of a ghastly greenish hue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were several gangs of these repulsive crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures at work about the warehouse. In charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">each gang was one of the evidently superior race we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had first seen, ivory white of skin, alert and intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Fleckner found that the increase in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of his rays enabled him to manipulate them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a fair degree of control within certain limits.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was able to move the focus about pretty much</seg><seg type="columnLine">at will now, shifting various sections of the golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley on his screen. But he was still unable to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of his former close work, to control close-ups</seg><seg type="columnLine">or look beneath surfaces. The projector refused ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solutely to respond. He tried to throw one of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">images into a lonely spot in the valley, to see if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be done, but got no results.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But with the power we had, we were able to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">much. Our interest centered on the scene of activity</seg><seg type="columnLine">in and around the big warehouse. Professor Fleck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner was positive that some of the treasure was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to be transported to the outer world and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be able to follow it with his reinforced</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays and at last learn the location of the valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of the green-lined men were hitched like</seg><seg type="columnLine">draft animals to low, rude trucks, made, like every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else we had seen so far, of solid gold. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers were piling golden bricks into some of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were shoveling precious stones into others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With all inv constitutional indifference to wealth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it gave me a curious sensation to see those trucks</seg><seg type="columnLine">piled high with uncountable riches, as though they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so much gravel or clay bricks. The contents</seg><seg type="columnLine">784</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of any one of the trucks would have made me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich man for life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eagerly Fleckner followed with his ray the first of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trucks to leave the warehouse. It went out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">winding gold-paved road along the river shore, past</seg><seg type="columnLine">many houses of gold, to a spot where a square ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavation had been dug. Here beside piles of similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">material, the trucks were dumped. Masons were</seg><seg type="columnLine">laying the cellar foundations of a house with these</seg><seg type="columnLine">bricks, mixing the gems with cement and preparing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a concrete to make the cellar bottom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again Fleckner's hopes were dashed. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually dawning on him and the rest of us that</seg><seg type="columnLine">here was a land where gold and jewels took the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of earth and rock and had no value except as or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinary building materials.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So with a snort of disappointment, the professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned his rays back to the warehouse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For the present," he said, "I think we'd better</seg><seg type="columnLine">study these people and get some clue to the meaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their tongue. When we can understand their</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech, we can learn something of what all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">means. I still think, Blair, that I've located the real</seg><seg type="columnLine">master of the crime trust, a defective with a fan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tastic, Oriental type of mind, who has carried out</seg><seg type="columnLine">here on earth, his dream of a heaven of golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were able, quite clearly, to catch the scraps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of conversation that went on in the foreground of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our warehouse picture, so we sat down to a steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">period of linguistic study, keeping, as usual, cinema</seg><seg type="columnLine">and phonographic records of all that occurred and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning to our old system of taking turns at watch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Stimson now took an active part in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">study, flashing occasional suggestions from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen in the other apartment to ours in the labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We learned another curious fact about this Golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valley of Tantalus. There seemed to be no day or</seg><seg type="columnLine">night there, only a steady, unbroken glow of soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. The men in the warehouse worked for a period</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly corresponding to our day and then rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a like period.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That tends to confirm your guess that this valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be somewhere within the South Polar Circle,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fleckner said to me. "It is now daylight for six</seg><seg type="columnLine">months there. This seems to be our first real clue</seg><seg type="columnLine">to location."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The weeks that followed were monotonous enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">excepting for the occasional discovery of the mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of a word. Each new word caught by associating</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with some object or with an act of the speaker be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came an event to be looked forward to eagerly. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">became a game with us, each trying with the rest to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see who could locate the greatest number of new</seg><seg type="columnLine">words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GREAT was our triumph one day, when by con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribution to the translation, we were able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch the general drift of a conversation between</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of the foremen, who sat on a pile of bricks in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foreground and talked earnestly for over an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour after the laborers had stopped work. We had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen these two in conference many times before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We took advantage of the laborers' sleeping period</seg><seg type="columnLine">that day to go back over all our phonographic records</seg><seg type="columnLine">of speech and make translations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Patching all our scraps together, we made out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected story of absorbing interest. Tt seemed that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the two foremen was a new man in the valley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had recently wandered in by accident through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Great Ravine" from "Beyond." His companion in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their conferences was telling him the history of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley and instructing him in its ways.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The story we gleaned hinged about a mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">"treasure" which the people of this valley possessed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In this strange land where gold and precious jewels</seg><seg type="columnLine">were common as the dirt under the feet of us ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary earthlings, there was an article so precious that</seg><seg type="columnLine">men fived for it, slaved for it, committed crimes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">died for it. What such a "treasure" could be was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond our power of imagination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For many ages the green men lived happily in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley in savage simplicity, wearing no clothing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwelling in caves, or rough huts of gold. Never</seg><seg type="columnLine">having heard of the "treasure," they were happy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">never fought among themselves, for each had all he</seg><seg type="columnLine">desired, and sought nothing from his neighbor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then down through the "Great Ravine" from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Beyond" came and settled among them the men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ivory skins, straight, tall, and beautiful to look upon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And they dressed in robes of spun gold and had im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plements and dishes of gold and tools with which to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion them. They had also, each man, some more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and some less, a portion of the treasure, which being</seg><seg type="columnLine">new and very rare, the green men looked upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly and coveted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then said the ivory-skinned ones to the green-hued</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of simpler minds, if you will work for us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">build us houses of gold fashioned as we shall show</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, we will give you bits of our treasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so the green men worked for these new</seg><seg type="columnLine">masters and were paid in bits of treasure, but being</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupid men could build these houses only as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">masters watched and directed their labors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And when the green men saw how comfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the houses of gold, they asked the masters to</seg><seg type="columnLine">direct them while they built houses for themselves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This the masters agreed to do if they would pay them</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in the treasure they had given them. And so</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then when the green men did more work for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">masters, the masters paid them with leaves of worth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less gold that were promises to give them treasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">later on. "Meantime," said the masters, "we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping the treasure hidden and safe, but these leaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gold will mean that you hold a share in it. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is more of the treasure out in the ravines. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">will show you how to find and dig it up and let you</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep half of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the green men found a little treasure and kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of it until they saw how useful were the masters'</seg><seg type="columnLine">tools and dishes and how beautiful was their cloth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Then the masters sold them these things for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure the green men still had. but they paid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green men for the work they did only in the gold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaf promises to pay treasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the green men continued to work more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more for the masters in hope of some day getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">back some of the treasure and they fought and stoic</seg><seg type="columnLine">among themselves for the little treasure that was left</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them. But they never dared fight the masters</seg><seg type="columnLine">because they were too cunning and powerful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then there had come down from the Great Ravine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madga the Great, with his beautiful daughter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Olanda, who was then only a baby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Madga was more cunning yet than the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">masters and he had with him more treasure than</seg><seg type="columnLine">TREASURES OF TANTALUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">785</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">any of them. The other masters all sought his favor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he traded among them till he had most of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure also. And so he came to rule over them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and also over the green men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">, And now that Olanda, the beautiful daughter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madga, had grown up, many of the young masters</seg><seg type="columnLine">desired her for a mate. But her cruel and covetous</seg><seg type="columnLine">father had decreed that he should have her who first</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him one full measure of treasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such was the story we gathered from our frag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentary records and I tried to set it down as nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as possible in the simple speech of the narrator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking back to the record of the little scene by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river between Olanda and her father, Madga,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the young man whose name we now knew was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grudga. we were able to interpret that Grudga was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of Olanda's suitors and apparently the one she</seg><seg type="columnLine">favored most. She had found a bit of the mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure and her father had snatched it from her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here Miss Stimson broke in from her screen in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other apartment:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None of you has translated the song yet," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said triumphantly. "I've just worked it out. Would</seg><seg type="columnLine">you like to hear it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By all means!" Priestley exclaimed eagerly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These are the words she chanted in a surprisingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">close rendering of the original melody and a voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">which for me, I confess, held more charm than that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the singer of Tantalus:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        I am the Treasure of the Valley</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        Where iny proud sire rules in glory,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       Many there are who s^ek me,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        One there is who shall find me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        He who is worthy to hold me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        Must bring of his lesser treasure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        And pay it fully and freely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        In proof that his heart is single,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        For I am the Treasure -&gt;f the Valley</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        Where my prouc sire rules in glory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXIV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Beneath Our Feet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN the girl finished this rendition of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">rival's vainglorious song, I glanced at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Priestley out of the corner of my eyes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see how he had taken it. He looked a little crest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen. I was conscious of an unreasoning feeling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jealousy at the thought that the singer of the transla-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion might have put some of her own feeling toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend Priestley into her voice. Mingled with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">jealousy was a little inconsistent indignation that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not reciprocate her feelings, but was lavishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his emotions futilely on this unknown, barbaric</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am sick of the very sight and sound of treas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure !" was his final petulant comment on the song.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It seems quite essential, though, even in affairs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart. Come! We're wasting time. Have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more inspirations, Professor Fleckner, for locat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing this mysterious place?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Fleckner eyed him shrewdly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled. I think that he realized for the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">that our romantic coworker was madly in love with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mysterious Lady of Tantalus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Priestley," he laughed, "for a young man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorns treasure so much. I must say you show an</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing impatience to get at it. I suppose what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're after is to find out the nature of the mys-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">terious stuff these fellows in the valley have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">making so much fuss over and grab off 'one full</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure' of it ahead of the other young bucks in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">list. It beats me, though, what that stuff can be--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is so much more valuable than gold and jewels</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they use the latter for building materials.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "However, I haven't any more ideas about locat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the thing. I'll have to keep experimenting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the adjustments of my instruments, and if neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary add further ray units until I can get the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicators to record direction and distance again. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps in the mean time the terrestrial current that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing havoc with us will subside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see our green and white folk are stirring again</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the valley. Let's get on with the story."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So we turned back to the screen on which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown the images of our strange people beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">their tasks again. Professor Fleckner succeeded, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, in exploring the valley a little more widely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently we came upon a house of gold much larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the rest, half hidden in a big rock cleft sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by high, golden palings. A cohort of green</seg><seg type="columnLine">men armed with heavy gold clubs guarded it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While we were examining this curious structure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Olanda, the singer, came out of the gate. We judged</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, and rightly as it proved, that this was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palace of Madga, her father and chief of the valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl hurried down the river shore until she</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to the little cove where we had first seen her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had in her hand a little golden spade and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this she began hastily digging in the sands along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water's edge. It was here she had found that bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mysterious treasure which her father had</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched away at the time when we first saw her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evidently she was looking for more of it. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident, too, from marks along the shore that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">or others had dug there many times since the find-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the first treasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After an hour of fruitless search she threw down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spade petulantly and turned away in despair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a long time she stood staring off over the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">in deep thought, now and then stooping and picking</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a diamond or amethyst or ruby and abstractedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossing it into the stream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly her eyes widened as with the dawning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an idea. She clapped her hands in delight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped away down the river road. In front of one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the houses that lined this highway her steps lagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she began to hum softly her familiar melody.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She had nearly passed the house, when a young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man came out of the door, and ran toward her. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not the favored lover we had first seen with her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Olanda," he called. "May I walk with you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You may," she replied, "if you'll comfort me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little. I'm in trouble."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Trouble?" he said, falling in step with her. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be no doubt from the expression on his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was one of her suitors. "You know I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">do anything I can to help you. What is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can't help me," she answered. "It takes</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure to help me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Treasure!" he exclaimed, stiffening a little. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have it, a little of it. I have been saving it for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose. I must have a full measure of it before long</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I am ever to be happy, Olanda."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She smiled back at him so understanding^ that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face flushed with hope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I need only one little nugget and I need it</seg><seg type="columnLine">now," she said. "I must have a new robe and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">786</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">father won't let me have it unless I find and give him</seg><seg type="columnLine">one nugget of treasure. He is growing more of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">miser all the time. He thinks I am finding treasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hiding it from him, but I'm not. Oh, if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only let me have one little nugget to get my</seg><seg type="columnLine">robe. I will repay you when I get another."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The infatuated youth hesitated only an instant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, bidding her wait, he went into his house</seg><seg type="columnLine">and returned in a few minutes with something tightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched in his hand. He gave it to the girl and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily concealed it in her robe. The look she gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him was a rich reward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now I must go home and get my new robe," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said and left him to his musings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she was no sooner out of his sight than she</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowed her pace, and went thoughtfully along, head</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed as though considering her next move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Olanda!" came a joyous hail from the mouth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ravine she was passing. Another youth stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into sight and beckoned her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come in a little way where we won't be seen,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "I have something to show you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl obeyed wonderingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "First tell me, Olanda," the young man asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously, "can I hope that you wish it to be me who</seg><seg type="columnLine">brings the measure of treasure to your father?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The warm, shy look she gave him was answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never was there a surer hope," she whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then look," he said proudly, displaying a golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure he drew from his robe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their heads bent over it together. We could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the contents, but they caused the girl to cry out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with delight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Almost half a measure already!" she exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where did you come by such wealth ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I searched and found them during sleep times</seg><seg type="columnLine">when no one could spy on me. I dug them from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocks up along the Big Ravine. There are no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more there, for I've searched every space. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know I'll get the rest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And if I had only three of them now I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be happy," the girl sighed. And then she repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the story of the new robe, only this time she placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her father's demand at three nuggets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But if I give them to you," the youth demurred,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"it will take me that much the longer to win you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned away in disdain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you are to turn miser like my father you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">never win my heart," she sneered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that he capitulated and in a moment the fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">schemer left him with the three nuggets stored away</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her robe beside the first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All that day she roamed about the river shore and</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrived to meet altogether twenty love-sick swains,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of whom, in his turn, listened to some variation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the story of the new robe and parted with one 01</seg><seg type="columnLine">more nuggets of the treasure he was accumulating to</seg><seg type="columnLine">buy her from her father. Each was made to think he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the favored suitor and that greatly strengthened</seg><seg type="columnLine">his generosity. Three times during the day when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the collection of nuggets under her robe threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to become conspicuous, she went down to the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">cove where she had been fruitlessly digging and</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last time she visited the cove, she stopped first</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her father's palace and when she reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">burial place of the treasure she took out from under</seg><seg type="columnLine">her robe a golden measure. She scooped out the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">buried nuggets and piled them in this measure, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">reburied the whole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again she kept the treasure hidden under the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her robe so cautiously that we got no chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">analyze it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By now it was sleep time again in the valley. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl, instead of going directly home, strolled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little way up the glen and sat down on a golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulder, as if waiting for some one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few minutes later, steps were heard above her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Grudga, her favored lover, swung himself down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She sprang to her feet and went to him in excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must leave at once," she whispered, drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to him.

Fleckner countered. "It was pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er he wanted. What is treasure without the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">it brings?

I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">read his thoughts in his transparent countenance as</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily as though he had spoken them. The duplicity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the beautiful Olanda had not destroyed his infatu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation.

To mitigate my impatience, I whiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">away the time by reading the newspapers, which in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our excitement over the affairs of Tantalus, we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">neglected for some days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Fleckner's preoccupation with other</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters and his inability any longer to use his tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phonoscope at will had, of course, removed his guid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hand from the malicious activities of the crime</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust for many days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But a glance at the papers showed that the reign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of terror he had started had gone on under its own</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentum, increasing like a snowball rolling down</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hill. Tt was to be assumed that organized trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">activities had ceased, as the gang would not dare to</seg><seg type="columnLine">act without its leader's orders. But the publicity</seg><seg type="columnLine">given to the series of inspired robberies and black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mailing plots had evidently stirred to life the morally</seg><seg type="columnLine">defective traits of many individuals all over the globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had not been enrolled in the organization. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the papers teemed each day with reports of a world-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide crime wave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The distrust in banks and business corporations that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had started had grown until the nations were in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throes of a financial panic.

The two or three instances of apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad faith on the part of statesmen, manufactured by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the professor, had set the imagination of the poli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticians to work. No one any longer trusted any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">else. Dissensions were breaking out everywhere be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the component nations of the League. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">League Council was rent with strife.

Beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden stockades could be heard the bustle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakening household. The green men who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood guard during the rest period were about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">change watches with the work period guards. There</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was a voluble chatter of greetings and scraps of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gossip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Hendriga made known to the guard at the gate that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wished to see Madga, the chief.

"That added battery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators overloads the thing a little."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made some rapid adjustments among the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildering mass of coils and switches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There, that's better," he announced.

A shade less than three minutes passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the cutting off of the picture on the screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the instant when it flashed back as Fleckner</seg><seg type="columnLine">switched on the power of his repaired instrument.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We stared in bewilderment. At first it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the ray must have shifted and given us an</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely different outlook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But closer inspection showed the same outline of</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhanging precipice and the house in its deep cleft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The dwelling was of the same form and size. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">river passed it at the same sweeping curve. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same vista of the valley visible from the gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet the gate which three minutes before had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in perfect repair, now hung half open from a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">hinge. A broken bit of chain dangled from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">latch. The golden palings when we last saw them</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gleamed with the brilliancy of frequent polishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">by green-hued slaves. Now they were dull and bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, as from long neglect and lack of repair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The roadway in front of the house that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept in perfect condition, showed great cracks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn gaps. What had been neat grass-plots be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the road and the paling three minutes before</seg><seg type="columnLine">were patches of weeds. Between the palings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house, where before had been close-clipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrubbery, were big trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the sturdy, laughing young guards, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood alertly in front of the palings a moment be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, some dozen strong, were all gone. In their</seg><seg type="columnLine">place there perched 011 a boulder by the gate a dirty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dejected old man, looking more like a beggar than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a guard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What could it mean ? This could not be the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. Our rays must have been diverted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blowing out of the fuse. This must be another</seg><seg type="columnLine">near-by cavern, I conjectured, in which a prosperous</seg><seg type="columnLine">race had formerly dwelt. Perhaps Madga himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">had once lived there and built this house and later for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some reason moved to the other and strikingly simi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar valley and duplicated the structures in it. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be out of keeping with the other per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formances of this strange master-defective. I voiced</seg><seg type="columnLine">these theories to Fleckner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That may be," he agreed. "I was thinking some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of the sort myself. We'll soon find out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He started to swing the rays about and search for</seg><seg type="columnLine">another cave when we heard voices within the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">TREASURES OF TANTALUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">789</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">house, high-pitched, angry voices, speaking in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">now familiar tongue of the cavern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fleckner sent our rays through the open gate past</seg><seg type="columnLine">the neglected garden into the house. His last addi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to his generator power had enabled them once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more to penetrate surfaces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the main hall were three people engaged in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heated wrangle. There was something about each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them strangely familiar yet weirdly different.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a middle-aged woman, tall and still slen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der and fair of skin. Her features were strikingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">like those of Olanda, daughter of the chief. Indeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">she might well be the girl's mother. But the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression of the face was hard, cold and petulant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old, well-preserved man beside her was even</seg><seg type="columnLine">more like Madga, father of Olanda, than was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman like his daughter. His was the same erect</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure, arrogant bearing, and crafty, avaricious ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression. The features seemed an almost exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">duplicate of Madga's, save for more pronounced</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines of age. The only difference between them was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their flowing hair and beard. Madga's was rusty</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold.

To announce publicly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">our paper money had been inflated by such an enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous amount of indistinguishable counterfeit stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">would complete our present panic, depreciate our</seg><seg type="columnLine">currency almost to the vanishing point, destroy all</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence in our government issues and create gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral financial ruin.

Then I'll begin to ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold to Point No. 20, and let you know when to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This interview with Winter, Priestley reported to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in detail, but of course I printed only the version</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant for public consumption. A few days later I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the pleasure of publishing the first results of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new regime of the former crime trust under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leadership of Priestley, when the first vanload of</seg><seg type="columnLine">restored money was met at the trysting-place by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the district attorney's men. Winter had some trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting his chief, the district attorney, to agree to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Priestley's terms that the criminals who were sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to have turned State's evidence should not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have their identity revealed, but he finally conceded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The radical element of the public, however, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud in criticism of this blind following of an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicted man. Some radical papers even hinted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Priestley had guilty knowledge of the original thefts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To the day of his death, my old friend suffered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">this suspicion hut refused to let me write the truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his vindication as long as he or the other prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cipals in this secret episode were alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fie was soon cleared of the technical charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him, however. When it became apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Fleckner would he a very sick man mentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">and physically for many weeks to come, Priestley's</seg><seg type="columnLine">counsel consented to go to trial without his testi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mony. The evidence of the rest of us proved suffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient and Priestley was acquitted. Tt was ruled, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long distance method he used for getting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cousin's signature to the release of his fortune was</seg><seg type="columnLine">valid and the telephonoscope was thus given a definite</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing under the law.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Treasures Revealed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT all this time the mystery that had baffled</seg><seg type="columnLine">us so long, the puzzle that had unseated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fleckner's reason, remained as much a mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery as ever. We were no nearer than ever to locat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the hidden wealth of the crime trust. For that</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter the second collection of loot gathered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden by Fleckner himself, during the months of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his regime, proved as elusive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our earthly Treasures of Tantalus were still as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much out of our reach as that mysterious treasure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the star Tantalus a thousand light years away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Between us and those great stores of hidden wealth</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the disordered minds of two sick men, Chandler</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Fleckner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the ex-President-elect was still pitifully weak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though convalescing, and common humanity forbade</seg><seg type="columnLine">our applying threats to him in the hope of getting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clue to the funds of his old organization.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for Professor Fleckner, he had occasional lucid</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervals, as he gradually grew stronger in body, hut</seg><seg type="columnLine">all inquiry regarding his secrets at such times threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into-a fury which resulted in a relapse into irra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionality. So Ruth Stimson, who continued to care</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him as tenderly as though he were her father,</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally forbade our troubling him further.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man grew very fond of her and never</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted her out of his sight. One night, after he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been restless and almost violent at times, he settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at last for a fitful sleep, muttering deliriously</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and then. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ruth! Ruth!" he whispered suddenly, half rous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in}?-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She bent over him solicitously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. What is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't keep it from you any longer. You've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been so good to me. It's under the old mill race near</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the treasure van was lost that time. It's all</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he fell into the first natural sleep he had en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joyed since his attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The reader will recall that Fleckner's two men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">John and James, had, according to his statement</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he first boasted to us of his stealing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure van, assisted in hiding that loot. Afterwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had evidently arranged with another agent by way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the telephonoscope. But John and James had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted for parts unknown the moment the Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">collapsed that day, so we got 110 chance to quiz them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, they did not seem to have dared touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of the treasure, for I'riestley's agents' found it</seg><seg type="columnLine">intact where Fleckner in his delirium indicated, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was presently hack in its home vaults.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That left the big mystery of the original treasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">to solve. There was also the problem of what should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the future of the telephonoscope, which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">proven itself such a dangerous implement. Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fleckner was convalescing now. He had never been</seg><seg type="columnLine">irrational again since he unconsciously gave away his</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret. He was still confined to his bed and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentle and affectionate with Ruth Stimson hut cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and uncommunicative toward us. He was evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">unrepentant. He did not know yet that his treasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been restored to its owners and he still discussed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his schemes with Miss Stimson for finding the crime</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust loot, alternating this with speculation as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was finally accomplished by the three sons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Olanda on Tantalus, the star, and what their mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious treasure really was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tt was a serious problem, then, as to what would</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen if the unrepentant Fleckner continued to usej</seg><seg type="columnLine">his invention against the privacy of the world. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no law to prevent his so using it if he chose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though now that his invention was known, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">796</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer employ it for criminal purposes. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other hand, if he turned it over to general use, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">mischief might not he done with it by an irrespon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible public?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were discussing these vexatious problems in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory one evening, Priestley, Ruth Stimson</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I. It had been a light day on the paper and 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">was olT early. Professor Fleckner was asleep and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruth had tiptoed out of his room and joined us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Priestley had turned the telephonoscope on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chandler's home earlier in the evening and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">him much improved in health. He was alone in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house with two nurses and his servants. It was gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erally known that relations between him and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">family had become strained since his breakdown had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost him his political honors. Mrs. Chandler was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold, selfish woman and their children shared her</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Priestley was inclined to regard this as just retri</seg><seg type="columnLine">bution for his sins, but Ruth was warmly sympathetic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I recalled her strange visit to Chandler's home that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time when she had procured Priestley's release by</seg><seg type="columnLine">impersonating the President-elect. I also remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered the night when she warned Chandler away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the van when we were about to trace him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his treasure-trove. I wondered wh^t had been her</seg><seg type="columnLine">relations to the Chandler household and again re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called my vague suspicion that she might once have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a member of the crime trust herself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Priestley was arguing that now was the time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear before Chandler and compel him to give up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secret of the treasure, or. if he was telling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth about a man still higher up, to force from him</seg><seg type="columnLine">some clue by which we might locate that person.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" Ruth demurred vehemently. "It isn't the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best way to force people to do right. Better to per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suade them. My woman's intuition tells me that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no man higher up, that he really knows where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the treasure is and would like to get it off his soul.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm going to try it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wonderingly we watched her go to the telephono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope board and throw on one of the lesser rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had not been tuned up for the long distance work</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the star Tantalus. She found Chandler's house</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a moment she revealed him asleep in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bedroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '1 hen she threw on the projector and stood in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. It was dark in his room, but as you know, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays were independent of light that the eye can see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you awake?" she asked gently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man in the bed miles away opened his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stared unseeing into the darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who's there?" he cried out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is I. Don't be alarmed. I want to talk to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you," she replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Agnes !' he exclaimed hoarsely. "Where are you?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Am I asleep? Oh, I've wanted you so much lately</seg><seg type="columnLine">since they've left me alone.

So I took it each tithe</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a big seaplane, flew out over the ocean and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dumped it where it would never betray itje.

Since my wife's</seg><seg type="columnLine">death three years ago I have lived thus, taking my</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast and lunch at a restaurant, generally taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">my dinners at the club.

No; I emphatically deny having invented</seg><seg type="columnLine">the story. However, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future will talk for itself. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will merely proceed to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">the details of my strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience on paper, (jus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tice to myself demands that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should do so, so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">garbled accounts have ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared in the press), and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the reader to draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own conclusions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CONTRARY to my usual custom I had dined</seg><seg type="columnLine">that evening with Hodge at the Hotel Oaks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let me emphatically state that while it is well known</seg><seg type="columnLine">among his intimates that Hodge carries a flask on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hip, I had absolutely nothing of an intoxicating</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature to drink. Hodge will verify this. About eight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty I refused an invitation to attend the theatre</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him and went to my rooms. There I changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into smoking-jacket and slippers and lit a mild</seg><seg type="columnLine">Havana. The rocking-chair was occupying its ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">customed place near the center of the sitting-room</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">floor.

With a note-book and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pencil placed on the stand beside me, also a copy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frederick Engels' "Origin of The Family, Private</seg><seg type="columnLine">Property and The State," I turned on the light in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my green-shaded reading lamp, switched off all</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, and sank with a sigh of relief into the easy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. It was my intention to make a few notes from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Engels' work relative to plural marriages, showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he contradicted certain conclusions of Morgan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he said . . .

I did not doze; I am posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive of that. My mind was actively engaged in try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to piece together a sentence that would clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">express my thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I can best describe what happened then by saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was an explosion.

A blinding flash of light registered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">appalling vividness through the closed lids on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">retina of my eyes. My first thought was that some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one had dynamited the building; my second, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric fuses had blown out.

When I could . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord," I whispered weakly, "what's that!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Occupying the space where the rocking-chair had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood (though I did not notice its absence at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time) was a cylinder of what appeared to be glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing, I should judge, about five feet high. En-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cased in this cylinder seemed to be a caricature of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man--or a child. I say caricature because, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder was all of five feet in height, the being in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of it was hardly three. You can imagine my</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement while I stared at this apparition. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">awhile 1 got up and switched on all the lights to</seg><seg type="columnLine">better observe it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You may be wondering why I did not try to call</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone in. I can only say that thought never oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred to me. In spite of my age (I am sixty) my</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves are steady and I am not easily frightened. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked very carefully around ftie cylinder and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">viewed the creature inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">from all angles.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were large, winkless; the nose well defined; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lower part of the face and mouth ran into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small round body with no sign of a chin.

Of the thousands of years</seg><seg type="columnLine">separating your day from that of the Bi-Chanics I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no authentic knowledge. My exact knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">begins with the Bi-Chanics. They were the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">among men to realize that man's bodily advance-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment lay on and through the machine. They per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived that man only became human when he fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ioned tools; that the tools increased the length of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bis arms, the grip of his hands, the strength of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles. They observed that with the aid of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine, man could circle the earth, speak to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets, gaze intimately at the stars. We will in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crease our span of life on earth, said the Bi-Chanics,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">by throwing the protection of the machine, the things</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the machine produces, around and into our</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies. This they did, to the best of their ability,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and increased their longevity to an average of about</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred years. Then came the Tri-Namics.</seg><seg type="columnLine">More advanced than the Bi-Chanics, they reasoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that old age was caused, not by the passage of time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but by the action of environment on the matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which men were composed. It is this reasoning</seg><seg type="columnLine">which causes the men of your time to experiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">with chicken hearts. The Tri-Namics sought to per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect devices for safe-guarding the flesh against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wear and tear of its environment. They made</seg><seg type="columnLine">envelopes--cylinders--in which they attempted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring embryos to birth and to rear children, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">met with only partial success."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You speak of the Bi-Chanics and of the Tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Namics," I said, "as if they were two distinct races</seg><seg type="columnLine">of people. Yet you imply that the latter evolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the former. If the Bi-Chanics civilization fell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did any period of time elapse between that fall and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rise of (he Tri-Namics? And how did the latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">inherit from their predecessors?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is because of your language, which 1 find very</seg><seg type="columnLine">crude and inadequate, that I have not already made</seg><seg type="columnLine">that clear," answered the Ardathian. "The Tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Namics were really a more progressive part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bi-Chanics. When I said the civilization of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter fell, 1 did not mean what that implies in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">language. You must realize that fifteen thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">years in your future, the race of man was, scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tifically speaking, making rapid strides. It was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">always possible for backward or conservative minds</seg><seg type="columnLine">to adjust themselves to new discoveries. Minority</seg><seg type="columnLine">groups, composed mostly of the young, forged ahead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made new deductions from old facts, proposed radi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal changes, entertained new ideas, and finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">culminated in what I have alluded to as the Tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Namics. Inevitably, in the course of time, the Bi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chanics died off, and conservative methods with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. That is what I meant when I said their</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization fell. In the same fashion did we follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tri-Namics. When the latter succeeded in rais-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing children inside the cylinder, they destroyed them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves. Soon all children were born in this manner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In time the fate of the Tri-Namics became that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Bi-Chanics, leaving behind them the Machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">Men of Ardathia, who differed radically from them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in bodily structure--so many human nucleii inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">of machines--yet none the less their direct descend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time, I began to get an inkling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the Ardathian meant when it alluded to itself as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Machine Man.

Here was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to whom I could show the cylinder, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature inside of it! someone to bear witness to</seg><seg type="columnLine">having seen it besides myself.

When one considers</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter closely, it becomes utterly preposterous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Obviously a material substance could not be opaque</seg><seg type="columnLine">to gravity. The very fact that it is a material sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance makes it susceptible and not impervious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity. That is the vcrv essence of gravity. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter is attracted to alf other matter, and where</seg><seg type="columnLine">ihere is anything there is gravity. I can conceive</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a screen of some sort of ray or ethereal wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which the action of gravitation cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">function, but a material substance, never! And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">furthermore, ahove a screen opaque to gravity, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">ii'ntter of what it was constituted, a mail could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE JUNE ISSUE OF AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">never assume an attitude of suspension.

I hardly believe that a ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the size of the "Woodrow Wilson" would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have sufficient gravitational attraction to enable a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to walk comfortably about it. On the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, assuming Paulo to be a solid body, the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traction of this body would far overcome the grav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity of the ship, unless the electronic wall is opaque</seg><seg type="columnLine">to gravitation. In this case, however, the passen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers would find themselves in the unpleasant situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of being unable to stay on the ship comfort</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably, weighing, naturally, only a few grains, or less.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 was unable to find any scientific error in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third story, perhaps because it contains less science</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The I.ost Comet'' was very good.

To cap the climax, I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not believe that the author intended to put the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest bit of science into it, other than that</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary to make it comprehensive.

I would like to say that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">for one approve of the Amazing Stories Annual</seg><seg type="columnLine">and would like to see it published every six</seg><seg type="columnLine">months as a semi-annual, and I am sure many</seg><seg type="columnLine">others feel the same way about it although they</seg><seg type="columnLine">may not write and say so. Probably some of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">think. "Oh, well, what good will just one more vote</seg><seg type="columnLine">do?" but if we all felt that way about it we never</seg><seg type="columnLine">would get anywhere. But I'll wager they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">all buy the "Annuai." if it is published every</seg><seg type="columnLine">"six" months. 1 would like to say that I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Annuai. would sell better if all the stories in</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were new ones that had never been published</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Amazing Stories before. Several of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends never bought the Annual because you</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated that it was to be a group of Ihe best stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">H.

My answer would he, ''Because</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I like it." 1 have read every story in every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">issue of Amazing Stobies, since the first issue,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and have no intention of missing any in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">future, and I am not a magazine reader. Amazing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Stokiks is tile only magazine I ever did read,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and right n6w, is tile only one I have any inten-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion in reading at all regularly. 1 am telling you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this first, Ijecause 1 am going to give you a few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of my ideas, in tile way of constructive criticism,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sonie rif which perhaps will not he very favorable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">1 wrote you once before and gave you some of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the same ideas, and now I am going to do it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">again. I might remark also that il I did not like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Amazing Stories I would not bother about writing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you and giving you any of niv time. 1 never did</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it (or any other magazine, and never will, until</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">something else, as good, in general as your maga-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">zine, comes out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Your motto is "Extravagant Fiction Today, Cold</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fact Tomorrow." An excellent and undoubtedly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">true motto, but sometimes, 1 find, your magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">does not stay with it. Every true scientist admits</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that, anything which is intrinsically possible, no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">matter how wild and extravagant it may seem, may</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">l»e cold fact some day, but the scientist, at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">same time, also admits that nothing can ever be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fact, which, of itself, is impossible. A square</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">circle can never be made. The definition of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Scientifiction Story could be thus stated: a story</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which depicts the intrinsically possible, but not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">actually existent, a-, actually existent. It is obvi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ous that a story which depicts the intrinsically im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">possible, as actually existent, is an effrontery to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the intelligence, for the reason that the human</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">intelligence is so constructed that it refuses to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">function in the presence of known falsehood. Some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">things are evidently intrinsically impossible, as tile</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">square circle, but others are not so evident, but at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the same time, just as impossible, for instance the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">situation in the story about the lust continent of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Atlantis, which I will take tip presently. You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">should carefully guard agaiiis't allowing such stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to get into your magazine, because they refute</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">your motto, and I have noted quite a number of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">such instances in various ones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now for a few of my objections. As I say</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">above, you sometimes print poor science, in that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you allow authors to depict intrinsically impossible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">situations. Ill the story about the lost continent,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the passengers on the ship view the inhabitants of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the lost continent, going far into the past to do</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so, and THE INHABITANTS look up at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ship. AN INTRINSIC IMPOSSIB11.ITY. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">passengers were viewing that which had taken place,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much as an audience in a picture show views what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the actors did when the picture was being taken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">An action which lias been completed can no more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lie changed than can a circle be squared. When</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the inhabitants lived, the ship was not there, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so they did not look up at it. Therefore the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">author has made his characters do something which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had already been completed, over again and in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">another way. That story had no business in your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">magazine. It was entertaining, it is true, but that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">makes no difference, it has no place in a scien-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tifiction magazine, as it is merely fiction, not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">science.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   My really most serious objection to your stories,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in general, is the lack of imaginative nerve of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so many of tile authors. There is entirely too</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much ruthless slaughtering of innocent heroes and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heroines, and entirely too much blowing up and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">losing of valuable new inventions. The authors</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">get to the end of their imaginations, and take the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">easiest way out. They tlu not seem to realize that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">most readers of this class of story arc imagina-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tively inclined themselves, or they would read</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">something else, and being so, the reader can get</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">just as much, if not more enjoyment out of con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tinuing the story in his own imagination, as he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dill out of the story itself, and this useless</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slaughter, and unnecessary explosions eliminate this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pleasure to the reader. A rare instance of where</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the author has allowed this privilege to his readers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is in the Master Mind of Mars, in your Annual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Neither Valla Dia nor Paxton were unceremoni-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ously removed al the end of the story, as so many</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">great heroes and heroines are. but are allowed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to remain happily wedded on Mars. The readii</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is permitted by the author to change his own name</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to Paxton, and have a grand time, carrying on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in his own imagination, his own elevation, through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deeds of prowess, to the Lordship of Mars, and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beautiful results of Valla Dia's rise with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to be the Queen of Mars, or any other flight of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the imagination to which the turn of mind of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">particular reader may direct him. The Master</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mind of Mars is well on in its sequel in my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">imagination, and f am having as much pleasure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Ut of my own sequel as I did out of the story</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">itself. "A Columbus of Space." offered the same,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if not even better possibilities for the reader's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">imagination, but the author would have none of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it. finding it necessary, in the temerity of his own</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">imagination, to dispose of his wonderful hen* and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heroine, hy letting them get caught in nothing but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a common fire, when they had already escaped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">many more dangerous situations, thereby denyin?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the reader the enjoyment of imagining his owt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scfluel.

I have ridden into town many</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a time in my car, the car being apparently with-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out a driver; I have paid for my gas with money</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">appearing out of thin air; I have been a marvelous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">magician; 1 have used it in games such as foot-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ball, throwing an invisible pass into the waiting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">arms of an end down between my own goal posts,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">(.ush but Doc I'nsin was a nut to let the thing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">alone, and his friend needed a good swift kick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He was just an old grouch.

The War</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the Worlds, is a good one in point. The first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">installment was good, but the second, in this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">month's issue, was awfully dry. The exper-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">iences of "my brother," could just as well have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been told in one paragraph, including the exodus</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the people. The reader of this story did not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">give two whoops about "my brother," 01 the exo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dus nf the people other than just the fact that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they lit out. What the reader wauled to know</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was what were thp Martians like, and what were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they doing. Had this story been but the first in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stallment, plus about three pages, it would have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lieen fairly good, but as it is, it got to be an awful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bore. While I am on this story, just a few of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my impressions while I was reading it.&gt; Mr</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Wells certainly commands a punk army. His</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cannoneers could not hit the broad side of a barn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">His guns were efficient enough to be effective, for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one did accidentally hit a Martian and knock him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out, but at very close range. The Martians fought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in 100 foot towers, and Mr, Wells' gunners got a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">great number of shots at them, mostly from a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">range of about 10(10 yards. Gosh, give an Ameri-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">can gun crew one good six inch gun, and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chances that Mr. Wells' army had and they could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clean out the Martians in short order. Men in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this story are certainly depicted as a lot of ignor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">amuses, and ought to be wiped out. What were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the men doing with the nine spheres, after the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">first one lit and men found out what was in them?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Why did they not blow them up? Mr. Wells does</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not relate that the first ones protected the second</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and later arrivals. How greatly would it have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">improved this story, if, in the end men had figured</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out the Martians' susceptibility to disease and fed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them the germs, instead of just letting them acquire</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them naturally. The men would have won a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">great battle against great odds, while as it was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they just got off lucky, without using any inven-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tiveness or human intelligence. I would certainly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hate to think that the United States army would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">light out and be incapable of fighting 110 more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">formidable foe than as Mr. Wells depicts the Mar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tians. Mr. Wells certainly drew 011 his imagina-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion when lie conscripted his army, not construc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tively, but just the opposite. His army wras not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">half as good as armies which actually exist right</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">now. Let Mr. Wells' Martians appear in this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">country today, and how long would tlu-y last?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Gosh, let's let men, in our imagination at least,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have as much intelligence and ingenuity, as they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have in actuality. What's the use of imagining</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if we are going to go the other way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   A suggestion which I would like to make is this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Why not publish the name and address of contribu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tors to your discussions, so that other readers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could write them, damning them or commending</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them, as they wish? I had a letter published in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Radio News once, and got a flood of letters 011</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">account of it. one from as far as Finland, and 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">may assure you that I consider myself well paid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for the trouble of writing that letter, as it has</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">led to friendships which could not have been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brought about in any other way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Another suggestion. Occasionally publish a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">letter which candidly and openly gives your mag-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">azine the royal razz; publish the name and address</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the writer; let the editor refrain from com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment to the effect that the writer is wrong and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">let the readers hop on him. You may he assured</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that we will do it. and with a vengeance. Let's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">start a real discussion and let the editor keep out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of it. Lots of us readers are somewhat of scien-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tists ourselves, and we do not need the editor to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">put us rieht. Tf 'here is not space in the maga-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">zine to pumish it, publish names and addresses</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and let us have our arguments in private.

The rest of the stuff he has given us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">has been. I believe, but mediocre reading. There</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is no snap, no life to iiis sioiics.

I especially</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like interplanetary stories of all the different</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">worlds and distant universes. I would be glad for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you to give us more of these kind of stories. And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">while on this subject, let me ask you, why don't you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">publish some of the stories written by Homer Eon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Flint? I have read several of his planetary stories,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and all of them I enjoyed reading. I remember</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in particular one of his stories that I liked very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much, "The Planeteer." This story was published</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">several years ago in another magazine. (In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Argosy" or "All-Story Magazine" about 1917 or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">1918.) I would enjoy reading this story again,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and also some of his other stories. Can you print</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this story and any of his others?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Of the stories you have printed, some of my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">favorite authors are A. Merritt. Edgar Rice Bur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">roughs, Garrett P. Serviss, and a few by H. G.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Wells. The trouble with Wells in some of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stories is he uses too many words in describing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a situation, and it becomes tiresome. However,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some of his stories are very good, and his science</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is usually good. I consider ''Station X" one of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">your best stories. And as for your comedy stories,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I consider your magazine is no place for them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">None of them are interesting, and I think most</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of your readers will agree with me. It will please</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me if you will leave them out of your magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">entirely. And I have a suggestion to make you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and Mr. A. Merritt. You have stated that Mr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Merritt will give us a sequel to his story, "The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Face in the Abyss." Why can't he combine this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sequel with another of his stories, "The Moon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pool ?" That was an excellent story, and deserves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a sequel. Mr. Merritt could easily put the char-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">acters of these two stories together into one real</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">good sequel, covering both stories. Both stories are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">somewhat similar in their texture, science and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">general settings. Will you take this up with Mr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Merritt?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   With hcst wishes for the success of your maga-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">zine, and hoping to see this letter printed in your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">next issue and with your answers to my above</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">questions.

Some of them I read some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">years ago. 'The Second Deluge" was very good,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but others like "The Land That Time Forgot" is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a great strain on the imagination, for I should</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">say it was an utter impossibility for types of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fauna and flora of Palacozoic, Mesozoic and Ceno-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">zoic, to be living at the same time. I should</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">say that atmospheric conditions of the Mesozoic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">period was unfit for life of the Cenozic to ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ist in. Life of the Pliocene time to be in ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">istence with the Jurassic, doesn't sound feasible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Again as regards the astronomical writers. Why</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">do they always give poor little Mars such a bad</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time? Simply because the planet is reddish in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tint doesn't necessarily mean it is of a sanguinary</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">disposition, which all fiction in regard to it seems</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to suggest. The presumption is that being a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much older planet than the Earth it is by thou-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sands of years more civilized, if life exists at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Take Edgar Rice Burroughs' latest brain wave,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Master Mind of Mars," and all his other yarns</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about Mars. It is nothing but battle, murder and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sudden death,_ besides having the most grotesque</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">forms of life imaginable. There are men of pur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ple, green, yellow and every color of the spectrum,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dressed like Roman warriors, with short swords</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and, Ye Gods! radium guns. Can you beat it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Again, consider "The Man Who Saved the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Earth." Once more poor little Mars.

Amazing Stories:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Being an interested reader of your remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">£aziiua and being rather interested in prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">s and theories of science I have come to you</seg><seg type="columnLine">i a few queries concerning objects' extensions</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fourth dimension. The story by Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">•i, "The Four Dimensional Roller Press," was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clever, but it was rather contradictory to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jtions of the fourth dimension. In the story</seg><seg type="columnLine">fthor had a baboon's fourth dimension in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">[1. or rather had the animal's normal density</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ised. I deem this act impossible for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">•pie reason that it violates the laws of gravi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">i. Scientists tell us that if a man from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">\ were placed on the planet Uranus, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">irally crushed to death by bis own weight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jher words his extensions in the fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ision would be too tjreat in the said planet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">•it;. the normal density of his body is too</seg><seg type="columnLine">.all. and therefore would have to undergo</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanges to meet the required density that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">■aid body demands. That is, the relative density</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sf an object is governed by the celestial body on</seg><seg type="columnLine">hich it exists. One of the authors in your maga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that gravitation is protonic in nature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">•elievc that this is quite true, and it readily</seg><seg type="columnLine">gests that the extensions of an object in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">•rth dimension, is governed by the force that</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed upon it during its existence in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">lestial body. Therefore, it would seem to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Hob Olsen's fictional bahoon would col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jse back into its original density, as soon as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">•ived coming out of the machine. The density</seg><seg type="columnLine">TMld he too small to exist op this planet, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">me as the hypothetical Earth man placed on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  •	planet Uranus. It seems to me therefore that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  s would apply to every chemical element known,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  at is all the elements known to us have rela-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  •cly different densities, because they may exist</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  n bodies that have a tremendous or insignifi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ntly small gravitational force. Furthermore, if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  nan from our world was placed on Mars, would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  •	his density be too great for the planet's gravi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  inal requirements? Then it would seem that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  tnan's size would be increased and his density</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  rased without his being aware of the fact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    change would be so quick that it would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">oticeablc. However, this again seems contra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ry to modern views of science, so I am at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">a! to what to make out of it. What do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">nk shout it? In closing I wish to remark upon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">: wonderful values of your magazine on the pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">s fictional and scientific mind.
