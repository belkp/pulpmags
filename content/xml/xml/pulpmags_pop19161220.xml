                <seg type="columnLine">Small wonder that Rimrock Jones was disillusioned with humanity, for the very town of Gansight</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">itself owed him its existence, yet the element that considered itself exclusive frowned upon him and</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">his wild ways. They did not stop to consider that Rimrock put the town on the map, and had been</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">duped and robbed legally by old McBain and L. W. Lockhart. Now, undismayed at his hard luck,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Rimrock was again prospecting out in the Tecolote hills, and felt sure he had struck it rich. People</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">laughed at him and his claims. When he tried to borrow money to work his mine he found his friends</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">scoffing as usual. However, the little typist for McBain, Miss Mary Fortune, a stranger in Gunsight,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">told him she would give him her savings, some four hundred dollars, provided Rimrock would give her</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">shares in his mine. So delighted was he that he swore he'd give her half. Then for a long time</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Mary heard nothing from him. Even when he came to town he neglected to look her up. She was</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">nettled, but kept her own counsel. Meanwhile, Rimrock had done his best with the loaned money, but it</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">was insufficient. One day, through a trick, he manages to get two thousand dollars from the banker</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Lockhart. Rimrock thereupon vanishes East. He goes to New York and interests capital in his</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Tecolote property, and returns flamboyant and apparently rich. Gunsight sits up and takes notice.</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Rimrock remembers all his friends generously. He visits Miss Fortune and offers her thousands of</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">dollars for her share in his Tecolote copper. But she is firm in her demand to remain a stockholder</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">and take her regular profits. Rimrock is annoyed and angry at her stubborn stand, though he admires</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">her spirit. At length, he agrees to her course, and signs an agreement. Troubles pursue Rimrock.</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">He cannot understand Mary. She is elusive. His proposal of marriage she turns down. McBain</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">tries to jump Rimrock's new property after fresh warning from the owner, and Rimrock kills him.</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Put in jail, Rimrock refuses to retain a lawyer, and is vindicated by the jury on his own showing.</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Mary and other of his friends urge him to relocate the dubious claim to his mine, but Rimrock</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">scoffs at their advice. Though Mary wont promise her cooperation in management of the property</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">against her principles, Rimrock insists on making her a director in the company. Whitney Stoddard,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">the New York capitalist behind the Tecolote development, begins his ciever maneuvering. One of his</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">minions, a Mrs. Hardesty, comes to Gunsight. She is beautiful and fascinating, and soon has Rimrock in</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">her toils. Mary, disgusted at the affair, leaves town without word. Keeping up her game, Mrs. Hardesty</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">lures Rimrock to New York, where he promptly bursts into a bloom of folly and stock speculation.</seg>
