            CHAPTER IV</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">THE UOX AND THE AXE</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Next day early I left tho town of the People</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the Axe. having bid a formal farewell to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Umslopogaas. saying, in a voice which all</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could hear, that as the rivers were still flooded.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I proposed to tTek to the northern parts of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Zululand and trade there until the weather</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was better. Our private arrangement, how-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ever, was that on the night of the next full</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">moon, which happened four weeks later, we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">should moot at the eastern foot of a certain</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">great, flat-topped mountain known to both of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">us. which stands to the north of Zululand, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">well beyond its borders.</seg>

        <ab>
            So northward I trekked, slowly to spare my</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">oxen, trading as I went. The details do not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">matter, but. as it happened, I met with more</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">luck upon that journey than had come ray</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">way for many a long year. Although I worked</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on credit, since nearly all my goods were sold,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as owing to my repute I could always do in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Zululand. I made some excellent bargains in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cattle, and. to top up with, bought a large lot</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of ivory so chcap that really I think it must</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">have been stolen All of this, cattle and ivory</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">together. I Rent to Natal in charge of a white</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">friend of mine whom I could trust, where the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stuff was duly sold very well indeed, and the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">proceeds paid to my account, the " trade "</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">equivalents being duly remitted to the native</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">vendora. In fact, my good fortune was such</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that if 1 had been superstitious like Hans. I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">should have been inclined to attribute it to-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tho influence of Zikali's "Great Medicine."</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">As it wa9. I knew it to be one of the chances</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of a trader's life, and accepted it with a shrug,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as often I had been accustomed to do in the</seg>

        <ab>
            In due course and without accident, for the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">weather, which had been so wet, had now</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">turned beautifully fine and dry. we came to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the great, flat-topped hill where Umslopogaas</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">awl I had agreed to meet, trekking thither</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over high, sparsely Umbered veld that offered</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">few difficulties to the wagon. This hill, which</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">trees grow wonderfully well, perhaps because of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the water that flows from its slopes. Forcing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">our way through this forest, which was full of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">game, I reached its eastern foot, and there</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">camped five days before that night of full moon</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on which I had arranged to meet Unulopoga&amp;s.</seg>

            At some time or other there had been a native</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">village at this spot; probably the Zulus had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cleaned it out in long-past years, for I found</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">human bones black with age lying in the lony</seg>

            The days went by pleasantly enough wit</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">a person's character, but after the lecture</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">She asked the audience to select two</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">unknown to her, were suggested, and finally</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">two were chosen. As they came upon</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the platform Dr. Blackford looked them</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over keenly, and, after a moment's thought,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">began to analyse both of them at once. As</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">know both men, that one was sociable,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">active, bold and determined, while the other</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was more or less of a recluse, very self-con-</seg>

            The first, she said, was brilliant, clever,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">a silent man, slow and deliberate when he</seg>

            The first man, according to Dr. Blackford,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was active, restless, always on the go, im-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">patient, and able to express himself only</seg>

            "The first gentleman," said Dr. Blackford,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">" would be a remarkable success as a lawyer,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">especially in court practice. The second</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would also be a remarkable success as a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">preparation of cases and the giving of advicc</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to clients. Therefore,'' she went on, " they</seg>
