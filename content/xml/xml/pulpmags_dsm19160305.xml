                    <ab>SYNOPSIS OF PRECEDING CHAPTERS</ab>
                    <ab>A NEW YORK physician, Doctor Thomas Bernard, is examining the body of a wealthy patient, John Brittain, who has just been
                        found dead, when he strangely encounters Humphrey Steene, a detective. At Steene's request, Bernard goes the same afternoon to
                        the detective's offices, and learns that Steene is at the head of a body of detectives who are operating against a secret
                        organ-ization thriving on graft and crime, headed by Ivan Ivanovitch. The organisation is called the Loyal Order of the White
                        Bear, consisting of Cubs, or probationers, who support the society finan- cially; members of the Intermediate Degree, who are
                        the men who commit the deeds of the order as laid out by a large group known as the Inner Shrine, the third and highest
                        division. Doctor Bernard tells the detective that John Brittain was murdered. At Sterne's offices, from which Ivan
                        Ivanovitch's rooms can be watched, they learn that Bernard is considered a marked man by the order. The doctor consents to
                        join Steene and aid him to the end. A plan is formed whereby attention can be turned from the doctor. Upon arriving home,
                        Bernard learns that Mildred Brit-tain--in whom the doctor has a personal interest--who is the recipient of her father's wealth,
                        has been kidnaped, and that Bob Brittain, her cousin, is a Cub.</ab>

                    <ab>SYNOPSIS OF PRECEDING CHAPTERS</ab>
                    <ab>ON street In New York's lower East Side, Wilbur Leigh, a man of dual personality, known as a playwright and author of stories
                        dealing with crooks and crime, is overtaken by two men of criminal bearing, Gus Hoch and Whitey Ward, and is offered valuable
                        material for his work if be will accompany them to the bedside of a dying companion. The writer consents to go, and, blind-
                        folded, he is put into a taxicab with the two men. Leigh succeeds in learning where he is being taken. He is brought to the
                        room of a crook calling himself William Silk Walker, whom Leigh rec- ognizes as Walter Lispenard Whitehead, a former
                        schoolmate, and receives a package of notes. Silk is a consumptive, and is suffering from a bullet wound in the shoulder. In
                        order to try out the schemes he invents for his stories, and to get thrills which he may depict with his pen, Leigh, un- known
                        to any one, has turned crook. He is to attend a lawn party to be given by Mrs. Winifred Fuller Templeton, a society leader,
                        for the relief of sufferers in Belgium, and decides to attempt to steal the jewelry and whatever else may be contributed.</ab>
                    <ab>Leigh visits Whitehead, whose bullet wound has greatly improved, and succeeds in getting him to consent to take a hand in the
                        robbery. While plans are being arranged, Gus Hoch enters, and is disabled by a drug administered by Leigh. Nick Carter, Chick,
                        Ida Jones, and Jack Wise accept Mrs. Templeton's invitation, and attend the lawn party. During the course of the affair, Mrs.
                        Templeton recognizes Silk Whitehead, the crook, who was a former sweetheart. The contributions to the relief fund are
                        deposited in a miniature ambulance, drawn about by four girls. Intending to examine the valuables contributed, Fuller
                        Templeton finds the ambulance empty. Nick is called, and, with his assistants, except Chick, who cannot be found, makes an
                        investigation. It is learned from Ruth Vance, one of the girls drawing the ambulance, that a man, offering to aid with the
                        load, took the little wagon around a clump of shrubbery near a discarded back-alley doorway. From three sets of footprints
                        found in the bordering turf, the detective concludes he has hit upon the course taken by the thieves who got away with the
                        loot.</ab>

                    <ab>PERHAPS the cases that are handled by the missing-persons departments at the police headquarters throughout the country
                        interest the news-reading public most, and hold their attention the longest.</ab>
                    <ab>A person of regular habits--be it man, woman, or child--who lives a well ordered life, abruptly drops out of sight, vanishing as
                        completely as a drop of water on a stone will evaporate in the summer sun.</ab>
                    <ab>At first the family of the missing one searches frantically; and then, in a panic over their failure, if they have ample
                        means, private detectives are called in, and, if they fail, the police, who soon get the ready aid of the newspapers.</ab>
                    <ab>For a while the case is in the thoughts and on the tongues of every one. Reasons are advanced, clews suggested, and,
                        simultaneously, from a dozen dif-ferent sections of the country come reports that the missing one has been found. And then
                        more often than not the search ends successfully with the finding of the person--or the body.</ab>
                    <ab>But in many, many instances the mystery is never solved, and the case fades into oblivion, save for those vitally concerned,
                        and the dusty records at police headquarters.</ab>
                    <ab>Sidney Lang leaves his friend, Burr Esmond, waiting at the corner of a busy thoroughfare, and steps into a theater to get two
                        tickets for the evening performance. He does not come back within a reasonable period, and Esmond investigates, to find that
                        Lang had bought the tickets some little time before. That night two men fill the seats for which Lang's tickets call, but
                        neither of them is Lang.</ab>
                    <ab>So opens the best novelette that Arnold Duncan has written. It is entitled </ab>
                    <ab rend="bold">A WHISTLER CONSPIRACY</ab>
                    <ab>and it mingles, in a finely woven plot, mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure so deftly that we feel confident that you
                        will agree with us in our estimation of the story.</ab>
                    <ab>William Wallace Cook, widely known as a fiction writer of rare ability, con-tributes the first of a series of detective
                        stories in the next issue, "THE BOX OF THE SEVEN GODS," in which a wily Oriental plays an important role in assisting to
                        unravel the mystery surrounding a theft of radium.</ab>
                    <ab>"PEARLS VS. DIAMONDS," by Louise R. Rhodes, deals with the strange disappearance of some valuable jewels from a place of
                        supposed safety in a New-port villa. The last of the present series of RED RAVEN STORIES, by Scott Campbell, which has proved
                        to be so popular, will be told in the next issue. Do not miss it, for the story is the best one that Scott Campbell has
                        written so far Among the other stories are "WILLING A NAME," by William F. Vassall, and "THE THREE-TOED CLAW," by Wilder
