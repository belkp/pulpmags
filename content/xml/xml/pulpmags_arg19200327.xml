            <seg type="columnLine">that was half shout, half groan, came from</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">But I might just as well 'a' saved my-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Well, I had it put right up to me the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then I saw it coming. The Comet</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pitcher had the batter in a hole: two strikes</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and one ball. He was a weak hitter, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it was a cinch he'd fan. A1 Leavitt was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">next up, and if A1 ever hit a ball he'd be so</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">astonished that he couldn't run to first,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">anyway. A1 thinks that baseball bats are</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Just a word about Spike McGinnis. You</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">have allowed him to talk to me that way--</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not right out in public, anyhow. And be-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sides, as it happened, Spike was out of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">luck--or thought he was--and so he was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pretty well down on the world in general.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">You see, Spike was superstitious, and--</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">well, it was like this: After the game the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">day before, when we were walking out of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the ball lot, Spike had offered to spin me</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for a couple of nut sundaes or something.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I said all right, and Spike tossed the coin.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">When it came down he muffed it and it hit</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the ground and rolled; we must have</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">looked for it for at least half an hour, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">we couldn't find it. And so that was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Spike's trouble. The coin was what Spike</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">called his " lucky piece," and now he'd lost</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it, and believe him he was in for trouble---</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he'd bet a cooky he was going to get the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rheumatism in his throwing arm again, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he had a hunch-right then that his wife's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mother was planning another visit, and so</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">forth and so on.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">And so you see there was some excuse</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for Spike's feeling the way he did, seeing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he was superstitious like that.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I'll cover the next few weeks by sim-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I'd better add a little something to that:</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at any rate, I didn't get caught at it. Ina</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">any little question came up at the house, I</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">points separating the two teams at any</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">time. Of course, in order to do that, I had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to get the breaks at least some of the time.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">As to whether I got them or not--all you</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">it was up to me to come through with a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">decision--I came. And if I hesitated--</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">well, anyway, nobody noticed it. At least</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I thought--but never mind that just now.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">And as regards the magnate--well,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Alonzo had picked up a few measly mil-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lions by never tipping off his hand; and so</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he had come to the conclusion that it was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a pretty good policy. And he kept it right</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">up in my case. He didn't throw any brick-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bats at me--or any bouquets. All he did</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Selfridge patted himself and smiled wide-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">And the hands, those white, blue-veined</seg>
