                        <ab>A Natural Born Salesman</ab>
                        <ab>You may laugh at this picture. But it should make you think! In the serious thought behind it is a truth so important to
                            you that it may mean the turning point in your career, sudden brilliant success, and more money than you ever dreamed of
                            earning!</ab>

                        <ab>IF the suggestion of levity in this illustration is unusual enough to make you weigh a vicious and unfounded superstition
                            against plain, every-day fact, it will have accomplished its purpose. For if there is one superstition that has victimized
                            thousands of men--keeping them in miserable, low-pay, routine jobs it is that old saw: "Salesmen are born and not made! "
                            The fact is that millions can sell, but don't know it!</ab>
                        <ab>He Found the Way!</ab>
                        <ab>Take thin situation--based on actual facts. A man who has worked all his life in a routine Job at low pay, suddenly
                            surprises hits friends by moving into a better neighborhood, taking a fine home, buying a car, and blossoming out as a
                            well-to-do and influential citizen. One month he was a mechanic, the next month he was selling goods and making more in a
                            week than he had formerly made In a month. Yet, he once thought sales- men were " born." That vicious superstition cost
                            him thousand** of dollars as long at he believed it! If only one man had done this you might call it luck; but thousands
                            have t;»ken this easy way to big incomes, financial independence, travel, congenial work, and steady employment And it all
                            came to them quickly--after they had found out that Master Salesmen are made and not born.</ab>
                        <ab>Thousands Learned the Secret </ab>
                        <ab>For example: Charles Beery of Winterset, Iowa, stepped from $18 a week to a position making him $1,000 the very first
                            month. J. P. Overstreet. Deninon. Texas, was on the Capitol Police Force at a salary of less than $1,000 a year. He
                            decided to see how much there was to that vicious superstition and very shortly after he earned $1800 in six weeks as a
                            salesman. F. Wynn, Portland, Oregon, ex service man. never thought ho was cut out for helling, but this Association of
                            Master Salesmen and Sales Managers convinced him he could sell, taught him how: and In one week he earned $554. George W.
                            Kearns. of Oklahoma City, was making $100 a month on a ranch and then earned $524 In two weeks as a salesman. Warren
                            Hartle, Chicago, spent ten years in the railway service. Then Jumped into selling and multiplied his earnings six times
                            the first year. The National Salesmen's Training Association has for fifteen years been taking men and women from all
                            walks of life; in fact, from every known occupation and profession, and making them high-grade salesmen. Your own logical
                            deduction will fell you that if salesmen were "born to the task," then the Association--the greatest institution of its
                            kind In the world-would never have survived its first year. Instead, it can proudly point to thousands of</ab>

                        <seg type="columnLine">instruction in the sciences. Medicine was the specialty to which she was peculiarly attracted.

                        <seg type="columnLine">from Persia, Syracuse and even the remote peninsula of Sirmio. The students of Hierophilus</seg>

                        <seg type="columnLine">and of the master himself it was affirmed that he could bring the hopeless invalid leaping with</seg>
