        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">the two became fond of each other--so much so that Atwood accepted the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cordial invitation of the cowboy to spend several weeks with him on his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ranch in the southwestern part of Arizona.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Atwood was furnished with a tough little pony, with which he began</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">making his explorations through the unattractive section. His nearest</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">neighbors were the Bozemans and their friends at their ranch, which, as has</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been stated, lay a dozen miles to the north among the foothills of the moun-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tain spur. He rode thither on the second day after taking up his quarters</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with Gannet, and made friends at once with the entire party.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">There were several causes for this. Atwood was educated, but never</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">attempted any display of his superior knowledge. He was good natured, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">knew so well how to accommodate himself to his environments that he was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pronounced one of the best specimens of a tenderfoot that had been seen for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a long time in that part of the country. He had a weakness, which some-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">times caused him to be referred to as a crank. This was a passion for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">taking pictures of the people, animals, reptiles, and natural scenery of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">region he was visiting. He threw out^ hints about publishing a massive</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">work of views, but added that whether he did so or not, he intended to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gather a collection at his home which would surpass anything of the nature</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to be found elsewhere.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was not a kodak, therefore, but a small, excellently constructed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">camera which he took with him on his travels. He was thus enabled to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">develop his own pictures, and to learn before doing so whether the nega-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tive was satisfactorj'. Many of the views thus gained were unique, instruc-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tive, and in a high style of art.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Nothing could quench the enthusiasm of R. Field Atwood. By the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">time he reached Yuma he had secured a hundred fine pictures. The train</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">making a lengthy stop at that heat baked city, he was naturally interested in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the groups of Yuma Indians, who gathered round to sell their bows, arrows,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and trinkets. At the suggestion of Gannet, the photographer stepped from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the car, and, setting up his apparatus, leveled it at a group of stalwart squaws</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and bucks. Everything was going along smoothly, when the Indians, under-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">standing his purpose, made a rush for the artist, who would have been badly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">used and had his property smashed, had he not managed to scramble into the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">train just in time to save himself. The aboriginal American has a mortal</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">antipathy to having his picture taken.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Austin Gannet was full of sympathy, and expressed his wonder that the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"I'm much obliged for your commiseration," replied Atwood, with a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">lively, but I don't understand why the people that have lived nearly all their</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Atwood had learned one important fact, since coming to Southwestern</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Arizona. He was in the land of the unspeakable Apache, the most terrible</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">red men that ever spread death and desolation among the settlements. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">knew that Geronimo and his baud had broken away from their reservation</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">more than once, and were likely to do so again. The people at Bozeman's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had told him strange, horrible stories of their outrages. Gannet himself had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">related an experience that sounded incredible. He warned Atwood ever to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">be on the alert, for when the fierce bucks descended it would be like a cyclone.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was because he could not forget this counsel that Atwood, as his horse</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">plodded over the flaming plain, cast frequent glances at his surroundings.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">' ' I suspect that even an Apache would find this temperature uncomfort-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">able," he remarked, after one of these surveys, "and so far as I can see</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">there are no signs of them."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">To the westward, behind him and in front, the yellow sand lay in rolls and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ridges, and with no other sign of life than himself and pony. To the east-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ward, rose the mountainous spur, gloomy, desolate, and forbidding, but so</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">far as the eye showed, equally devoid of life. A few miles further and he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would arrive in sight of the low, squat building, where Austin Gannet and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his hired man, known as Bumble Bee Beebe, made their home.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" This is too good a view to be lost," suddenly exclaimed Atwood, check-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing his pony with a gentle word ; "it must go into my collection."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">What there was ' ' good' ' in such a prospect would have puzzled the most</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ardent photographer to explain. Perhaps it was its very desolation that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">made it attractive. Be that as it may, Atwrood could not have been more in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">earnest had he been contemplating the wonders of Yellowstone Park or the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">magnificence of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. He quickly unstrapped</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his box-like arrangement, and dismounting, adjusted it on the triangle of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">supports, hardly thicker than pipestems. His horse was too worn to take</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">any interest in the proceedings, and his master gave no attention to him.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The ridge, which ran nearly parallel with the course he was following,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was some two miles distant, affording an abrupt break in the monotony of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The acquaintance seemed mutually pleasant, and the young man secured</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">permission to escort her to the little town of Ehrenburg on the Colorado.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The ranch was twenty odd miles to the southeast, and when, through some</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">misunderstanding, no one appeared at the town to meet the young lady, it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was manifestly the duty as well as the privilege of Kingsford to continue his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">guardianship to the ranch. The trip was easily made between sunrise and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sunset, and the young man was received as hospitably as the young woman.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">His prepossessing appearance and manners, his skill as a horseman and with</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">vitation to spend a week or two with them. In fact, since he possessed the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">means, he held serious thoughts of entering into the cattle business, the prin-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But the time came all too soon, when good taste forced him to bid his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">friends farewell for a season. Miss Warren expected to return eastward,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when the weather became more bearable, and in making his own calculations,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it need hardly be said that the young man assured himself he would be</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At Ehrenburg whom should he find but an old friend and college mate,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">who being weakened by pulmonary trouble, had gone thither for the benefit</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the dry, equable climate. The poor fellow, however, had waited too long,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and Kingsford saw that he was doomed. It was true comradeship that caused</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him to stay with the grateful invalid, until his life went out like the snuffing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of a candle. The friend did everything possible to soothe his last hours.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He took charge of his effects, wrote the particulars of his decease to his</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Left alone at last, it seemed proper to Kingsford, who had kept Miss</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">call upon his old acquaintances before leaving the Territory. He had received</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">several pressing invitations from them, and his reply was that as soon as he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could complete all his duties, he would ride over to the ranch and remain for</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">pause a while at the ranch of Gannet, with whom he had become well ac-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He was yet beyond sight of the ranch, when he descried a single horse-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the Southwest long enough to understand the need of circumspection in</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Despite his long experience in the Southwest, Beebe had failed to notice</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">several hummocks of sand, making the very oversight that Atwood did under</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">similar circumstances, although the danger was from another point. He was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">riding forward at his leisurely pace, when from those same piles of sand</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">several jets of fire spouted and the poor fellow lurched out of his saddle,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">without uttering a word, dead before he struck the earth.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Had Kingsford been a few minutes earlier, he would have met his friend</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at the precise point where both would have been shot. As it was, he escaped</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by almost a hair's breadth. He saw Beebe's pony galloping over the plain,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">terrified by the occurrence, but not an Apache was in sight. Having de-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">livered their fatal shots, they remained burrowed in the sand, as if they ex-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pected the second horseman to ride up and meet his doom in the same</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But brief as was the sojourn of Kingsford in the neighborhood, he had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">learned fast and well. He knew what the death of that single man signified.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was not the result merely of a whim on the part of the miscreants, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">meant that a band of renegades, despite the watchfulness of the military</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">authorities, had ridden off the reservation and started on one of their periodi-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cal raids of plunder and murder. He could form no idea of their number,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but they were usually less than a dozen--numerous enough to spread terror</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and consternation over an area of several hundred square miles. All the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ranches were in peril, for those murderous wretches always struck before the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">news of their coming could reach all the endangered points. The ranches</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of Bozeman and Gannet, as well as many others, were in danger, and Kings-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ford's heart almost stopped beating at the thought of what might befall that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">home which was his destination.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">These fears passed through his mind like a flash, but he made a natural</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mistake. He supposed several of the men were at home. They were watch-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ful and vigilant, and almost sure to detect the approach of the miscreants,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">unless stealthily made in the night. Had he suspected the actual truth--that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the women were alone--he would have ridden his pony to death, if necessary,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to reach the spot in time to give some help.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But he was much nearer Gannet's ranch. Only two men were there.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The probabilities were that they could not make a successful defense. Better,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">therefore, that they should leave, while the oppertunity was theirs, and hurry</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to the help of Bozeman and his friends. If the Apaches chose to run off some</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the cattle, they could not well be prevented, but they were not likely to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pause to do that, when so much more attractive " game " offered. Nothing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">less than murder satisfied them, and to that they would give their undivided</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was such a strange fancy that Mrs. Bozeman was silent for a minute.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then she saw that, dangerous as was the plan, it had its advantages. There</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were so many places for concealment that if they were once reached, the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The one obstacle that caused them to hesitate was the vague suspicion</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that the Apaches were maneuvering to bring about the very attempt. If so,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">some of them would be on the alert among the foothills to seize the fugitives</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the moment they came within reach. It seemed incredible that the hostiles</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would go away and leave this avenue open without preparing to turn it to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">account. And yet since the defenders had resisted them so successfully, it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would not seem likely that they would take to flight, when the danger had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shrunk almost to the vanishing point.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But the sisters might speculate for hours, and be as far from the truth as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at the beginning. The one fact was apparent--if they could reach the foot-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hills unobserved, it was the wisest thing to do, and they determined to at-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">They walked softly to the rear of the large room which extended the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">space which separated the structure from the first break in the land was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hardly two hundred yards distant. It was a brief run across that, but where</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was no evidence that it was not there in abundance. It was the same for a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">time with her sister, whose scrutiny was equally painstaking. The stillness</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the tomb inclosed them, and apparently there was no living person within</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the deepening shadow of the nearest cedar, an object moved. Had she been</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gazing directly at the spot, she might have been able to identify it, but she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was looking at a point some distance to one side, so that it was little more</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A question to Mrs. Bozeman brought the reply that she had not observed</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">stand that the flutter might mean everything or nothing. A watchful Apache</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would not be likely to betray himself, and it might be that it was only a piece</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of dead limb that had fallen to the ground of its own weight. And yet a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mistake was to decide the question of life or death.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The sisters stood in an agony of fear, unable to decide on the best thing to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Remembering that the front of the house had been left unguarded for a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">little time, the elder ran to the door and looked out. The first glance brought</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a shock that almost took away her breath.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A party of Apache horsemen were approaching on a gallop, and were so</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Kate, rifle in hand, ran to the front door, which was partly open.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But Kate did not intend to run out into full view. On the contrary, she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">brought her Winchester to a level and fired into the galloping horsemen.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Her shot was intended to check the tumultuous advance, and it succeeded in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">doing that, but also accomplished a much less desirable thing. The Indian</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">They did not pause. Mrs. Bozeman was the first to gather her skirts</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">An extraordinary complication followed. Mrs. Bozeman was slightly in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The fugitives were almost on the edge of the shelter when one of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the vanishing forms in the gloom. With a screech of exultation, he headed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his pony toward them and rode like a whirlwind.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">' ' Quick ! ' ' exclaimed Mrs. Bozeman, with a terrified glance over her</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Under the belief that her sister would heed her call, she made a frantic</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the same, had the space between the two been a single step less, but the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Apache was too near. She saw that a collision was inevitable, and if she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">permitted it to come while her back was to her foe, it meant her death, for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it would be the veriest child's play for the mounted devil to strike her down,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and it was because of this knowledge, that she did one of the bravest and</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Heedless of the prayer of her sister, she stopped short, brought her</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">mounted by the crouching demon, his hair flying in the wind created by his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">own speed; rushing down upon her like a cyclone. It all had to be done in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the twinkling of an eye, and pausing only long enough to make sure of her</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">of the hideous imp astride his back. Both plunged headlong to the ground,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Other hostiles were certain to be on the ground within a few seconds, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whirling around she dashed toward the point where her sister had passed</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">preceded her by only a few moments. The one thing was to get among the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">They must have heard the death shriek that followed the discharge of her</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">of attempting anything of the kind, the mounted Apache brought his gun to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his shoulder and fired at the point where the fugitive was vanishing. For-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tunately he had no time to take aim, and his shot was mainly by guess ; but,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as it was, the bullet whizzed so close to the cheek of Miss Warren that she</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">She glanced around and saw the buck, no longer able to use his horse,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">firing at him, as was her first intention, she darted to one side, ran a few</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">paces and then abruptly paused, with her back against a huge boulder. In</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the marvelous atmosphere of Arizona, the air is so clear that the stars shine</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with a brilliancy never seen in the north. Indeed the star gleam casts a dis-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tinct shadow, which, happily for the fugitive, inclosed her entire figure,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rendering it invisible to any one unless he came near enough to touch her</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Standing thus, she had to wait only a minute, when a shadowy figure as-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was the buck carefully searching for her, but he was depending as much on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his senses of hearing as upon that of seeing. Pausing within a rod, he stood</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">still and listened. The starlight fell upon him and clearly outlined his form</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to Miss Warren, who could make out the stocky figure, the bare chest, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the long, coarse hair dangling about his shoulders, while she was sure she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">saw the glitter and gleam of his snaky eyes, as they roved over the slight</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">space in his field of vision. His head was thrown slightly forward, and he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">held his Winchester tightly grasped in one hand at his side, from which posi-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tion he could raise it to a " dead level " at an instant's call.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The gun that had served the fugitive so well was held with both hands</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and extended across the front of her body, from which she could aim and fire</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it as quickly as her enemy. She had 110 intention of using the weapon ex-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cept in self defense, and the instant that was necessary, she would shoot to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">kill. She had lived but a short time in the Southwest, but long enough</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to know that every white woman exposed to capture1 by the demons carried</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a revolverÂ»with which to blow out her brains, on the instant that all hope of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">escape was gone. She never removed her eyes from the dusky figure, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">watched his every movement, ready to anticipate his first demonstration.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Suddenly he took a couple of steps forward, directly toward her. The</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">fire when he paused again, bent his head in listening, and then advanced, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with such a change in his direction that he would come 110 closer. It was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">an unspeakable relief, for it looked now as if the encounter was not to take</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Nothing was more natural than for her sister to use the same avenue, and she</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">young man was more likely than any one else to become involved with the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fate of the fugitives.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Kingsford was in the best possible fighting costume. His clothing was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">light, and he carried a fine repeating Winchester and an excellent revolver.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Around his waist was his cartridge belt, while his trousers were tucked into</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the tops of his boots, and his hat was of the broad brimmed variety so popular</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">among the cowboys of the Southwest.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Although unaccustomed to matching his wits against the subtle Apache,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Kingsford could not have done better had he received several years of train-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing. The first indispensable requirement was silence and caution. When,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">therefore, he struck the well remembered trail, made sacred by the sweet</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">associations connected with it, he moved over it like a shadow. The Apache</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">himself could not have trodden the ground with more perfect noise-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The mistaken supposition of the young man was that the assailants were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">so numerous that half a dozen had plunged among the foothills, taking the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">captives with them. If such were the fact, he might well ask himself by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">what possible means lie could rescue them or ameliorate their condition, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">jrouth is ardent and hopeful, and where the heart is concerned, mountainous</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">obstacles become only pebbles in the. path.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">With his mind active and all his senses alert, Kingsford pressed onward until</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he paused at a point where the trail was intersected by another at right angles.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He remembered it well, and the problem which checked him was whether to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">keep directly on, or to take one of the paths to the right or left.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Reason suggested that he should maintain the course he was pursuing,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">since that was the most direct route into the foothills, though each of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">others curved around so as ultimately to lead in the same direction ; but,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">before doing so, he had resort to a piece of strategy of which he had read</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and heard, though never until now had he occasion to put it to a test.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Kneeling down, he pressed one ear against the ground, which, as every</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">one knows, is a better conductor of sound than air. The result was start-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ling. He heard faintly but distinctly the noise of some one walking lightly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over the trail near him.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Kingsford was flustered for a moment, for he could not locate the sound</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">definitely enough to decide the direction from which the stranger was ad-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">vancing, if indeed he wras not going away from him. Fear of the last being</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the case, led Kingsford to press his ear to the ground again. The faint noise</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was louder, proof that the man or woman, whoever it might be, would speed-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ily reach the spot where the young man was crouching. The latter decided</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that his position was favorable and retained it. At the same time, he drew</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his revolver and held it in his right hand, ready for instant use.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The act required but a few seconds, but the precaution was not taken a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">moment too soon. Being partly extended on the ground, his position could</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not have been more favorable, for he was not likely to be seen by any one ap-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">body would show against the brilliant starlight. It was because of this that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Kingsford discerned the form of an Apache buck coming like a shadow over</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the main trail, as if he intended to tread the white man under his feet. And</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not only did Kingsford see the dusky miscreant, but incredible as it may</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seem, recognized him.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">When but a few paces away, where the star gleam struck him fairly, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stopped and partly turned his head, as if to look behind him. This brought</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his profile into clear view. The hooked nose and retreating forehead and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">chin belonged to an Apache vagrant, whom Kingsford had often seen at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Ehrenburg. He had made the redskin many presents and employed him to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">do odd jobs connected with the nursing of the failing invalid. Thus the two</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">became well acquainted, and the young man fancied there was a feeling akin</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to friendship between them. Rather it should be said that there had been</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">such a sentiment, for now the presence of Alkus, as he was called among these</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">merciless renegades, left no doubt that he was as vicious a wretch as Geronimo</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">himself.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Whether the Apache suspected some one was to the rear of him cannot</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">be known, but it is certain that he had no thought of the individual in front.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The first knowledge of his danger came when he saw a white man silently</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rise from the earth before him, as if shot upward by machinery through an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Opening in the ground, and that same man held a leveled revolver in his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">right hand, pointed straight at the painted visage, while from behind the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">weapon came the low words :</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" If you stir or call out, Alkus, I'll shoot you dead ! "</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The words were startling enough to frighten even an Apache. He re-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">coiled a single step, with the involuntary upward movement of his hands,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">one of which grasped a Winchester fully as good as that carried by his master,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whom he was also quick to to recognize in the vivid starlight.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It was no compliment to Harvey Kingsford thus to have kinship claimed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by an atrocious Apache, but he was wise, and the possibility of turning this</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sentiment of friendship, feeble though it might be, to his own purposes,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">restrained him from repelling the proffer of it.</seg>

        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">Kingsford knelt down and took a deep and refreshing draft. It was a</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He was in this perplexity of thought when he was startled by a shadowy</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">A few minutes were sufficient for an exchange of experiences. The</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The distress of Mrs. Bozeman and her sister was because of the agony of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Accordingly the proposal was acted upon. The task was not a slight one,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for there was fully half a mile of the roughest kind of traveling between</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">them and the comparatively level country. They had left the paths, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could not expect to find any more to serve them. Although the women had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spent several hours in the severest labor for their minds and bodies, they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">expressed their readiness to keep up the tramp until the home of their friend</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Kingsford took the lead, with Miss Warren walking close behind him and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">been no more demonstrative than in the case of the elder, but there was a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">world of eloquence in the face of each when, under the bright glare of the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At the moment of starting, Kingsford felt a gentle touch from the young</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">he reached back his hand and she took it in her own. Not a word was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">uttered, but there was a warm pressure on the part of both, and she released</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her fingers, thrilled as was her lover by the sweet exchange of confidence.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Littee was spoken by the three as they picked their way through the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">an instant the danger that impended over them. Should a meeting take</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">place, it would be impossible for all of the three to escape, and more than</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">likely every one would fall victims to the ferocity of the renegades, who</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Frequently Kingsford stopped and listened. At such times, his compan-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ions did the same while the bright eyes were not idle. The strong moonlight</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">added to their anxiety, for there were many places which they were obliged</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to cross where the illumination was almost like midday. If the Apaches were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">near, they could not fail to see the shadowy figures as they hurried past such</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">openings, and it was always with a shuddering dread that the passage was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">made.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A shock came to the three, when immediately after one of these experi-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ences, a stamping noise was heard as if made by the hoofs of a horse. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">party became instantly motionless, and peered intently in the direction whence</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the alarming sound came, while Kingsford grasped his Winchester and held</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it in front of him. Nothing could be seen, but, recalling the artifice by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which he had located the treacherous Alkus, he knelt down and pressed his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ear to the ground. The result was hardly less startling than in the former</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">instance. It seemed as if a hundred animals were stamping the earth near</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">them.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">And such was the fact. While he was still kneeling, Miss Warren saw</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">several cattle moving along the moonlit edge of one of the natural clearings.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">They were a part of the immense herd belonging to Bozeman that had wan-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dered to this locality, while looking for grass and water, and some of them</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were making a change of position.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A general smile followed the discovery and the party continued their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tramp, much relieved, for they reasoned that-if any of the Apaches were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">near them the cattle would show it by their nervousness. That they did</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not was proof that little was to be apprehended from the source of all their</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">One unpleasant suspicion, however, had grown into certainty. Without</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">rock, with their Winchesters so pointed that Kingsford, Mrs. Bozeman, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her sister were covered. The fingers already resting on the triggers had but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to press them a trifle harder to send the whites into eternity before they</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">malignant subtlety, the miscreant forgot one of the simplest of precautions,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">friends. The threat, therefore, of Geronimo to slay them unless they submitted</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could have no effect, for they would infinitely prefer death to submission.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Harvey Kingsford formed his resolution on the instant he recognized the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"If they slay you and spare us," said Kate Warren in a low voice, in</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I've told you what I shall do," replied Kingsford, with revolver leveled</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and his piercing eye fixed upon the fellow ; " you may spare the women, but</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">His hesitation told Kingsford that he had scored his point. The Apache</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Kingsford saw a quick glance exchanged between Geronimo and one of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">for an occurrence that was as wholly unexpected as the appearance of Gero-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">as of alarm. Geronimo looked toward him. Then the wrinkled, iron coun-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Kingsford dared not follow the direction of his eyes, for Geronimo would</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">pointed, and every movement of the chieftain was watched with unflinching</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">All at once three forms ran athwart Kingsford's field of vision, as if flee-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">exclamation, wheeled and followed them at breakneck speed, all four running</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as if Satan was nipping at their heels.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The young man had warned the chieftain that he would fire at the first</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">movement he made, but there had been 110 thought of the Apache doing</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">enough between the lines to understand that his life had been anything</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but saintly. Moreover, I was very much mistaken if he were not as ar-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I take no credit to myself for not being a coward : and I am quite ready</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to believe that there are sound physiological reasons for it. Nature may</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">shrink with dread from the thought of pain. But at no time in my life have I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cared for either ; and I have come to regard this as due to nature's considerate</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">omissions in my creation. Certain other omissions of hers have not been so</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">This will explain, however, why the thought of the danger which troubled</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">my new "sister" so much did not cause me even a passing uneasiness,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">kinds were fixed for the following afternoon. The initials of the persons only</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were given, but enough particulars were added to show the nature of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">business. Thus some one was coming for abet of 1,000 rubles; a money</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lender was due who had seemingly declared that he would wait no longer ;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and quite a number of tradesmen for their bills.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I soon saw the reason for all this. I was evidently a fellow with a turn</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and out of my creditors' way.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">pay their claims.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I swept everything at length into one of the biggest and strongest drawers,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the only means by which that could be done would be for me to write a note</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">M3? difficulties began at once with m3? regimental duties. I did not know</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">not have got to know the men. But I was just as ignorant of the regimental</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">routine, which ought to be a matter of course. I had questioned Olga 011</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">limited military experience to back me ; but I lacked completely that famil-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">iarity which only actual practice could give. This difficulty gave me much</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thought, and I am bound to say amused me immensely. The way out that I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">chose was a mixture of impudence and eccentricity ; and I relied on the re-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">putation I had suddenly made for myself as a swordsman being sufficient to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">chose a civilian that had been a soldier; aud under the guise of questioning</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">That was enough for me. I dressed and went to headquarters, resolved</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">But it was of great service to me. It emphasized the complete change in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I went next to the exercise ground and watched with the closest scrutiny</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">find au opportunity of returning the visit speedily. She made such an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">appearance of unbending to the other, that the difference between them was</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">first tried to captivate and then would remember that Olga was only consent-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">to think out this new set of most complicated problems.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Paula Tueski's visit had changed everything; and I saw it would be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">foolish not to look that fact straight in the face. I could not see how things</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">might end, but certain flight for the time was simply impossible. For my-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">self, I did not much care. I had had a few hours of excitement which had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">completely drawn me out of the morbid mood in which I had arrived in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Moscow; and nothing had happed to make me much more anxious to live</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">than I had been then.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Life might have been endurable enough, if I could have gone on with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">my army career as Lieutenant Petrovitch, but not if the abominable and dis-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">graceful intrigue were to be added as a necessary condition. That would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">be unendurable, and had I been a free agent, I would have ended the whole</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thing there and then, by admitting the deception and putting up with the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">results. Indeed, it occurred to me that in a country like Russia, where I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">knew that courage stood for much aud military skill for more, the reputation I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had managed to make would be likely enough to tell in my favor if I told</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the truth and asked leave to volunteer.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But was I a free agent? Look at the thing as I would I could see no</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">means by which I could get out of the mess, even taking my punishment,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">without leaving my sister in deep trouble. If Paula Tueski found that I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had humbugged her, and that Olga was in the plot, it was as plain as a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gallows that she would be simply mad and would wreak her spite on the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Could I leave Olga to this ? The words of confidence she had spoken</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">woman Tueski would place any obstacle in the way, provided I did not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">attempt to leave as well ; and I came to the conclusion that the best possible</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">course would be for Olga to take her departure at once. She could go and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">join her brother in Paris, or wherever he had gone ; and then I could carry</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on alone the play--farce, burlesque, comedy, or tragedy, as it might prove.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was early evening before I could get round to see Olga, and then I</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">business over again, and then went on to tell me of some famous duels which</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" But what of you? Do you think I do not wish to share the success</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which my brother is enjoying here ? Or are you thinking of leaving Russia</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">also?" By a swift turn of the head she prevented me from seeing her face</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">seemed so much more womanly than the laughing girl I had met first on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Moscow platform, and it was difficult to think that so short a time had passed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">since then. I filled up the long pause during which she appeared to be mak-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing up her mind what answer to give me, by thinking what a pleasant sister</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">a flush of indignation reddened her cheeks, and her eyes flashed as she looked</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I stared in blank amazement at the door after it had closed behind her,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and then, wondering what it was all about, left the house in a medley of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">her, and the consciousness that she was really a plucky girl, intermingled</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">themselves with the memory of how pretty she looked in her emotional in-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dignation. The thought of her tears, and that I had caused them, gave</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">me the worst twinges, however, and this kept recurring and bothering me</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At the club, where I went from Olga's house, I was careful to maintain</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">This was pretty much my own character, with some of the dash and life</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pressed out of it; and it was easy enough for me to maintain it. That night</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I played a little. I knew I had formerly been a pretty heavy gambler, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tonight I purposely stopped short in the full tide of winning. I had lost at</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">back my losses I stopped, to the astonishment of all who had been accustomed</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I left the club, and wanting fresh air while I thought over matters, I went</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Walking thoughtfully down one of the broad streets, I became conscious</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He was clever at his business, and several feints I made in the attempt to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">being troubled with any outside interference.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">'' Now, why did you seek to kill me ? " I asked sternly, as soon as the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">man was in my room. " You're not a thief ; your dress and style show that.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Why then do you turn assassin ? ' '</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" There should be no need for me to tell you that," said he, speaking</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Nevertheless, I ask it," I returned, with even more sternness. Evidently</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I was going to make another discovery ; and when the man waited a long time</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">before answering, I scanned him closely to see if I could guess his object.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Clearly he was no thief. He was fairly well dressed in the style of an ordin-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ary tradesman or a superior mechanic; his appearance betokened rather a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sedentary life and his muscles had certainly not been hardened by any phys-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ical training. As certainly he was no police spy. He was the last man in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the world to have been picked out for such a job as that of the attempt on my</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">life. There was no probability of there being any private feud against me ;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that seemed ridiculous.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I could only conclude, therefore, that the attack was from the Nihilists.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The man looked much more like an emissary of that kind--able to give a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sudden thrust with a sharp knife, but incapable of doing more. The instant</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I had come to this conclusion, and I came to it much more quickly than I can</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">write it, I resolved what to do.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I am glad this encounter has taken place--not omitting the result,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the street and told me I was to meet him on the south side of the Cathedral</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Square at nine o'clock the next night. There was a peremptory ring in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the message which I didn't care for, but I promised to be on hand.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I did not place the danger of attending the meeting very high. If I were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not murdered on my way to the place, wherever it might be--and that was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">highly improbable--I did not think they would venture to kill me at the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">meeting itself. Moreover, I reckoned somewhat on the effect I believed I</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I met the man by the cathedral, and muttering to me to follow him at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">twenty paces' distance, he walked oh, and presently plunged into a laby-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rinth of streets, leading from the cathedral down to the river in the lowest</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">quarter of the town. The place was ill lit and worse drained, and the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">noisome atmosphere of some of the alleys was horribly repulsive.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">In the lowest and darkest and dirtiest of the streets the man stopped, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with a sign to me not to speak, pointed to a dark, tumbling doorway.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The place was almost pitch dark, and as we had stepped out of a very</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bright moonlight, I had to stand a moment to let my eyes accustom them-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">selves to the change. Then I made out a broken, rambling stairway just</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ahead of us. Taking it for granted that I was to go up these, ignorant</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whether I was supposed to know the place, and quite unwilling even to ap-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pear to wish to hang back, I stumbled up the steps as quickly as the gloom</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would let me. When I reached the top I found myself in a long, low shed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that ran on some distance in front of me to a point where I thought I could</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I groped my way forward, the boards giving ominously under my feet,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when suddenly a voice said in a loud whisper out of the gloom, and as if at</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I stopped readily enough, as may be imagined, and then the silence was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">broken by the swishing, rushing swirl of the swiftly flowing river, while</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">currents of cold air, caused by the moving water, were wafted up full in my</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">again called to a halt, and after a minute the sound of the rushing water</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">came again clear and distinct, this time from behind me. Then a flaring</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">light was kindled suddenly and thrown down into the wide gap until, with a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">it was growing all too frequent for a village to be wakened from peaceful</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slumber by the wild yells of the savages, and, as their eyes opened, to see</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the glare of their burning dwellings, while every conceivable horror was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">being enacted, with those nearest and dearest as victims. As a rule, women</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and children were killed outright, but men and boys were captured whenever</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">possible, and carried off into captivity.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">doing before they had a chance to think, fighting for their own lives and the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Mire stepped on a twig that snapped under his feet. Two red men, lying</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">prostrate as sentinels near by, crept up with the stealthiness of cats aud</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pounced upon them ; gags were placed in their mouths to prevent their out-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cries, and far sooner than I can tell you their hands were lashed behind them,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and they were hurried away toward the densest part of the forest. Here they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were tied to saplings, while their captors ran back to enjoy the horrible war</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">man ; but after a day or two the Indians had divided into twTo bands, taking</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">What was that? An ear of corn surely, and another, and another, wrapped</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and buried in the moss. Hardly daring to breathe, he still felt the need of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">is beautifully located.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The island was a very secluded and lonesome one. The Spanish coast op-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Erik purchased this island from the Spanish government, which did not</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">small inlet on the southwest side of the island was converted into a very pretty</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Erik aud his wife had visited many foreign countries since that memorable</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">it. With the charm of newness gone, however, all this lost its attraction</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for him. He endeavored to be systematical in his experimental work in the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He became discontented with life in general and himself especially and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The more he pondered over this, the more he fretted that he could not</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">else--celebrity, undying fame--and that very dearest wish of his whole life</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was denied him. Hopelessly he writhed in mental agony in the effort to find</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">some means of bringing his discovery out into the world beyond the reach of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">these means would never bring the news into the hands of the scientists; some</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">railing, while he stared steadily at the two war vessels. They were both</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Melton dropped feebly on the stone floor, and Guy and the Greek sat</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">down against the parapet. Reaction had come to all of them. Now they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were really safe, the terror and excitement of the flight was visible on their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">faces. Their clothes were soaking wet, and the perspiration rolled down</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Their first thought was of Melton. He was still sleeping, but it was a</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The heat was now very great, and they suffered terribly from thirst. Far</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">fastened the painter to a rock, which had been placed in position for this</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the inference that Sam had committed some crime and was a fugitive from</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">he saw through the drizzling rain a dark shape move across the clear space</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in front of the Sink and stop in the black shadow of the live oak. There was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">only a single figure : the negro had not brought Rob.</seg>

        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">Bending his body to lessen the chance of being seen by the negro and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">keeping in the shadow of the trees until he was out of sight, he made his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">way to Sam's cabin through the wet grass along the lagoon. The gate of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the fence was locked. Peering above the pointed stakes, he saw the hut,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dark save for a gleam of red firelight that came from under the door and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">through a crevice in the rock chimney. There were no cracks between the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">logs--they had been carefully chinked with moss and mud.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Brock was too active to find much difficulty in climbing over the wall.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">As he dropped on the other side, the dog jumped upon him and seized his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">leg. A well aimed blow from the butt end of his pistol had the effect of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">making the brute loose his hold. Another blow stretched the dog senseless.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">"If he comes to he won't bother me any more," Brock said to himself.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He w7ent to the hut and walked around it, examining it attentively. It</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was built close to the ground ; there was no window. Hardy took his knife</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and picked out a piece of the mud and moss daubing from between the logs,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">making a hole through which, as he peered, he could see the interior of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hut. There was a fire on the hearth and an iron pot in which something</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bubbled and steamed. There was a pile of pine knots by the fire, a heap of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">moss--Sam's bed--in the corner, the cage with its snake tenant, a stool and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a rough table. There was nothing else. All was still, except the bubbling</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the pot. What prompted Brock to put his mouth to the crack and call</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out, " Rob ! Rob ! " Then louder, " Rob, where are you? "</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">There was a sound in answer--a sort of muffled cry. A pulse of hope</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">leaped in him ; with the next breath there was disappointment. A louder</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cry--harsh, croaking--drew his eyes to the shelf above the chimney. A</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">buzzard roosted there--its red, wrinkled neck stretched out in anger at being</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">disturbed. It was the buzzard's cry he had heard before. He felt sure of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">this ; yet he longed to call again, only he was afraid he should be heard by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Sam, who might be returning.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He replaced the bit of daubing, and looked around for a hiding place. In</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a corner of the small inclosure was a heap of pine knots and palmetto roots,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">piled there for fuel. He lay down close behind them and waited for the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">African.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It seemed to him he lay there a long time with the slow rain soaking</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">through his clothes. At last he heard a heavy tread on the sodden ground,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and next the rattling of chains as Sam unfastened first the gate and then the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">door of his domain. He dashed the door open with an oath. He was in a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rage over his disappointment. Presently he called his dog. The brute,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lying in the rain, had partly recovered from the stunning blow ; he got up</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slowly and obeyed his master's summons, receiving a kick as he slunk into</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the cabin. Then Sam shut the door of his hut and fastened it.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The rain increased to a heavy shower. Its rattle on the board roof of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hut prevented any sound of footsteps beiug heard, as Brock crept up to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">back of the house. Cautiously he applied his eye to the crack. Sam had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">taken off the pot, and poured its contents into a wooden tray. This he placed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on a stool, and sitting on the floor beside it, he was devouring the steaming,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">savory meat, stripping it, with his big teeth, from the bones he held in his right</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hand, and now and then taking bites of the corn ashcake he held in his left.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He ate rapidly, like some carnivorous beast, flinging the bones to the dog.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">When he had finished, he got on his feet, shoved the tray and stool to one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">side, and wiped his greasy face on the sleeve of his filthy shirt. He stood for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a minute, listening to the rain and mumbling to himself. Then he took up</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a spade, and inserting its edge in one of the cracks between the split logs that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">formed the floor, lifted one of the logs and flung it to one side. He squatted</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">beside the space it left ; stooping lower, he thrust his long, ape-like arms into</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">what seemed a hole or pit under the floor and lifted out something wrapped</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in a coarse blanket.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The folds of the grimy cloth fell away as the negro raised the bundle, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Brock came near shouting aloud as he saw the flaxen head and white face of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">little Rob. He thought the child was dead until he saw the round eyes were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wide open, and fixed in a stare of wild terror upon the face of his negro</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Hoodoo Sam put the child on the floor. " Set up," he said, giving the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">then, with a spasmodic jerk, the small hand clutched the bread and went to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the trembling mouth. But the effort to eat broke off in a sob.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He rushed across the room, caught up the cage and set it down close to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Brock could stand it no longer. Grasping the axe he had brought from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the wood pile, he rushed to the front of the hut and began to break down the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">door. With the third blow of the axe, the boards crashed in, and he leaped</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">through the opening. The African confronted him, brandishing a knife, his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">eyes blazing, his mouth distorted in a grin of horrible ferocity.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was knife against axe. Neither had time to get other weapons. The</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">ing to get in a thrust with his knife. He succeeded at length ; the thin,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">keen blade found its way into Brock's shoulder and snapped against the bone.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The negro wheeled to get his gun, but a bullet from Brock's pistol struck his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">arm, and suddenly turning, he leaped like a madman upon the young man</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and hurled him to the floor.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Brock was no match in strength for the powerful African. Before he re-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">covered from the shock of the fall, he was pinned to the floor and his revolver</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wrenched from his hand. One of his arms was held down by the negro's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">knee ; with the other, he struggled desperately to keep his assailant from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">planting the muzzle of the revolver against his breast. In the scuffle</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Boogger's cage was overturned, and the shrill rattling of the angry snake</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">added to the horror of the moment.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At last Brock's right wrist was caught by the negro's left hand and held</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as in a vise ; then, with a grunt of exultation, Sam turned the pistol to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">defenseless heart of his foe, who, panting and helpless, closed his eyes and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">waited for the bullet that should tear flesh and soul asunder. But instead</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">In an instant, Brock saw what had happened. The rattlesnake had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and hooked fangs, as it reared back after giving the blow, aud then darted</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">down, striking again and again before one could draw breath, burying his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fangs in the naked arm and the face of the negro, who seemed paralyzed for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a second. Then, springing to his feet, Hoodoo Sam seized the axe and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">began to strike at the snake with furious blows, his teeth set and the foam</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and Wagner are detected in a conspiracy to turn the workmen against Norbert. They are</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">imprisoned, and then Norbert, hearing that trouble threatens Khartoum, where M. Kersain</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">intercepted by Kaddour, the Mogaddem's dwarf, who makes them all prisoners and endeavors</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to obtain Gertrude's hand in marriage. Failing in this he resolves to march with the forces he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">possesses on the Peak, taking the prisoners with him, and there destroy before their very</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">eyes the work on which Mauny has built such high hopes. But the men employed by the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">young astronomer and those in the service of the dwarf come from the same country, and they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">refuse to fight against one another. Kaddour is taken captive and placed in charge of Virgil,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mauny's right hand man. Discovered in an attempt to win away the allegiance of the negro</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">guard, he is condemned to he shot, but swallows poison just before the execution is to take</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">place. Soon afterward the Mahdi's forces surround the Peak and call upon Mauny to surrender,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">forces that, in six days, are to bring the moon down to the earth. The satellite responds readily,,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and by the sixth day is so close and appears so immense that not only are the Mahdi's forces</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">utterly panic stricken, but Norbert's party themselves are terrified. Sir Bucephalus Coghill, one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the chief members of the company, ventures to hint to the young astronomer that he thinks</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it would be safer for all hands if the experiment be stopped--which Mauny says can be done by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">simply touching two knobs--when the baronet's valet, Tyrrel Smith, in an agony of apprehen-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sion, rushes to the tablet where the knobs controlling all the motors are situated, raises one</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">breathe there. However, he provides respirators, with which he and the baronet are enabled to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">start out on an exploring trip. They find that they cannot make any audible sounds and are</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Conversing thus by signs, Norbert, spurred on by his own enthusiasm,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">redoubled the pace, and took great strides of forty or fifty yards at once, so</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">At length the travelers reached a height to the west that they had been</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then, at last, the spectacle so longed for by Norbert burst upon him in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Innumerable stars gleamed like diamonds in an ink black sky devoid of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">there was a keen pain across his temples. Another minute and he would</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It was, indeed, a volcano in miniature, for the orifice was not ten yards</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Looking about for the cause of the noise, he discovered at the foot of the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The water was not good--it was full of sulphurous cinders that made it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nauseous ; but still it was water, and a treasure, therefore, not to be despised.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">They determined to remain there, and, fortifying themselves with a substan-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tial repast of biscuit, cold meat, and tea, they wrapped themselves in woolen</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Uranus and Neptune were not visible. He looked at Saturn, remember-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">One might have thought only a few yards separated the moon from the planet,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">She felt that outside of her little sphere, which was eminently respectable,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">there was a dreadfully wicked world. The papers reported domestic scandals</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">enough to show her that, although her life was a perfect calm, there was a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wild whirl arouud her that filled her with consternation. What if her hus-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">band were leading a double life, such as she read of every day or two?</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">At a ball last winter Jack had danced twice with that handsome widow</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">When Jack's business kept him late, why should she think at once of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that odious widow ? When Jack had been called to New York once she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could not keep from walking past the widow's house to see if she was still in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">town.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">One evening at dinner her husband announced : " My dear, I am obliged</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Well, I ought to see the dentist, and you've always said that no</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">one but your old friend Plomb should ever touch my teeth ; and after we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">are through we could drive in the park and go to the theater and have a</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Of course that settled it, and the next afternoon they took the train.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Jack was startled to see a familiar figure enter the next car. It was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">only a glimpse, but it did look very like that horrid widow. She did not see</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her again, however, and soon forgot the incident.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. and Mrs. Jack registered at the Imperial Hotel. They dined in their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">room, and retired early the better to enjoy the morrow's pleasures.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">After breakfast they called a cab, and Jack left his wife at the dentist's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and drove down town, agreeing to meet her in the parlor of the Imperial at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">one o'clock.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Jack looked very pretty as she sat in the parlor waiting for her hus-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">band. Her color was, perhaps, a little higher than usual, for it was after</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">two o'clock and Jack had not yet put in an appearance, and she was annoyed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and angry ; more than that, she was vulgarly hungry.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">A TALE OF TWO HOTELS.</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Three o'clock and no husband. " If I had some money, I'd eat alone,"</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">she thought.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A brilliant idea ! She caught a bell boy who was passing and sent word</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to the office that Mrs. Jack of Boston wished five dollars.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" We don't know the lady," came back the answer.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Jack felt mortified enough to cry.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Self preservation is the first law of nature, and Mrs. Jack did not propose</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to die of starvation. She wrote on one of her cards: "Dear Doctor, Jack</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">has been detained down town and I am famished ; please send me five dollars. ' '</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Calling a bell boy, she despatched him with this missive to the dentist, with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">instructions to bring an answer.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was about six o'clock. Mrs. Jack had spent the time staring out of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">window in hopes of seeing her missing husband. What a beastly day she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had had, instead of the one of pleasure she had anticipated.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I wonder if he's been run over," she sobbed, as the idea occurred to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her, and visions of her husband's athletic form nicely quartered by the cable</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">car floated before her. The idea was too harrowing and she threw herself</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">upon a sofa and cried heartily.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" My dear, you are in trouble; can't I help you," said a kind, motherly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">voice, and looking up, Mrs. Jack saw a neat looking old lady bending over</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her. '</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" My husband is lost ; do you think lie's been run over ? "</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Don't worry, my dear ; he has been detained on business, no doubt."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" But it is after six o'clock, and people don't work so late, even in those</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dingy law offices," she sobbed.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I beg your pardon, but does your husband drink? " asked the old lady.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Now there had been just one spot on the little woman's domestic horizon,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and the old lady had laid it bare.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Shortly after their marriage some of Jack's bachelor friends had called in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the evening and they had emptied the decanter drinking to Jack's happiness.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jack, who seldom touched spirits, was quite ill after they left, and his wife</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cried herself to sleep.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I've married a drunkard," she thought, "and it won't be long before</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he'll come home and break up the furniture and beat me--maybe murder</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">me." Jack had been dreadfully penitent the next day, and she had never seen</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him indulge since.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">She began to be uneasy, but determined that the stranger should not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">see it.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" My husband does not drink," she answered, somewhat unsteadily.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" With such a pretty little wife as you, he surely would have eyes for no</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Oh, that widow ! I'm sure she came down on the same train," thought</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Jack. " To think that Jack would treat me .so. I never want to see</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him again. I shall go right home and pack up and leave him forever."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I wish I had never seen the Imperial Hotel," she said aloud.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Why, have you been over to the Imperial? " asked the old lady.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Over to the Imperial? Isn't this the Imperial?" gasped Mrs. Jack.</seg>
