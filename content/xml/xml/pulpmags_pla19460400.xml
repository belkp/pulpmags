But Kortha</seg><seg type="columnLine">brooded, because Kortha was a coward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was not afraid for himself. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at his sun-bronzed, hamlike</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, and shuddered; glistening beads of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat appeared on his forehead. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">those hands he had killed men, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">•crippled his best friend for life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind him gleamed the red utta-bv\ck</seg><seg type="columnLine">smithy and his small shack, and the tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure he called his laboratory. Swing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on his heel, he went away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert and into the smithy. He made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellows leap, and the red flames spurt from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the furnace. With the tongs he lifted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-hot strip of metal and pounded on</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with a sledge that an ordinary man</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have found immovable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the clang and dance of hammer on</seg><seg type="columnLine">anvil, he lost himself; listened only to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad symphony of beaten metal instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the still, small voices of his soul. The din</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smitten steel jangling on the sootblacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">anvil was the music that helped the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget his heart. His eyes gleamed red</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the smarting flames, and he peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">into their depths with green eyes wide and</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry as though he beheld a corner of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost hell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not hear the muffled thunder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the 'copter that swung in a circle above</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shack and swooped downward to dig</seg><seg type="columnLine">its tires into the yielding sands. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not see the door open, and who came out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Kortha," said a voice like a song.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started then; looked up, brows fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowed.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore gauze trousers with broad leather belt</seg><seg type="columnLine">studded with jewels, and a bolero of arket-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fur.

His long arms, tanned by years</seg><seg type="columnLine">of exposure to a desert sun, were those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a king gorilla. She had seen Kortha snap</seg><seg type="columnLine">an iron chain with those arms; had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">him break a man's back, and other things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well did Ilse know the strength of Kortha,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the fact that she carried a heatgun in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her cloak was mute evidence that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of his mad, flare-hot temper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ilse sighed, "You could rule the Confed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eracy if you would."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And own gems to garland your hair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and furs to swathe your body," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His green eyes belied his voice: they</seg><seg type="columnLine">drank up the sight of Ilse and her red</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth and her platinum hair as a miser</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinks up the sight of his yellow gold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You idiot," she whispered.

He plays politics like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a master, does Guantra. Mars, with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich ore-beds and mines--Mars, the prize</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a war that does not concern her. Under</seg><seg type="columnLine">a united Mars, she would take her place</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the planets beside Earth and Venus</seg><seg type="columnLine">as members of the Council of the Trinity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Under the Confederacy, Mars could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done this. Once it was almost accepted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then--you ran away. And the Earthmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Venusians who feared your brains</seg><seg type="columnLine">and your body, Kortha--they revoked their</seg><seg type="columnLine">acceptance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They had agreed.

As Premier he stands an</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellent chance of fulfilling his ambition."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ilse came close to him, touched his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hers and clung. Her blue eyes stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously up to his green ones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you were to come back, and be that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruler," she breathed. "Kortha, Kortha,</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't you see Mars needs you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kortha looked , past Ilse, out toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red desert. Far in the haze of distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the black and jagged Mountains</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Eternity, there was something white that</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook and eddied in the heat waves rising</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from the sands. Kortha knew it for for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten Yassa, the city beyond recall. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead city, that ate up travelers that went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kortha sighed, and looked at Ilse. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways had Kortha wanted to go to Yassa.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a mystery about Yassa, a mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery that Kortha meant to solve. The time</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now come when he could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Give me time," he said to Ilse. "I need</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked at him and in the depths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her blue eyes there was an infinite sadness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a yearning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You lie, Kortha," she whispered, tears</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her eyes. "You do not ever intend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">return. Tell me why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked down at her and smiled. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">could he tell her? The long uncut blonde</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair that hung to his naked brown shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders swayed a bit as he shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I will, perhaps. But not yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not yet you cannot tell her, Kortha. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is for her sake that you have buried your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self alive. But she would not understand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She is turning now and going away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, perhaps forever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kortha walked across the sands behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">her toward the 'copter. Once his great</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands went out hungrily, then fell listlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his sides. Ilse was not for him. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of his brooding, the part that ached</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stabbed with loneliness. Ilse was what</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him a coward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the shadows of the flier the girl faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">him once again. She stood perilously</seg><seg type="columnLine">close, her eyes beseeching silently, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragrance of her hair and her curving body</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamed in his nostrils.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are no hermit, Kortha. You need</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. You need a woman. You need--me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He nodded, staring at her face, drinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in. He did not ever intend to see Ilse</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, Ilse whom he loved, Ilse of the fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair and the blue eyes and the body tanned</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown by Sol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kortha stepped back and his shadow fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">from hers. He lifted a hand, saying softly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Goodbye."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With arms hanging to his thighs, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood on the desert, watching until the dot</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was the 'copter in the sky passed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the horizon. Wearily he swung about</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went back to his hut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He yanked down a gigantic steel ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer from the wall, breaking the thong that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ENGINES OF THE GODS	5</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">held it to its nail. Gripping the hammer</seg><seg type="columnLine">•in his great hands, he swung it around his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, once, twice, in a flashing circle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue-white light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The walls crumpled when he hit them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The roof caved in and became the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scraps of brick and metal fell to dance on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shuddering tiles. Fire leaped from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forge, caught hold and grew in a red</seg><seg type="columnLine">frenzy. Red and huge in its crimson heat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kortha battered and slammed his sledge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">buckling even the wrought metalwork of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dwelling.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">taxied the flier across the square and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yanked back hard on the repellever. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose went up sharply, and riding the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">currents on blunt wings, the flier rose above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ruins of white Yassa and aimed its</seg><seg type="columnLine">prow at the desert.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ENGINES OF</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kortha slipped in the automatic control-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler, and ran fingers through his fur jacket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ilse will know the politics I've missed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in living on the desert for three years.

When he had done, the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered once again, and its sound flitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the arras-hung room, susurrating</seg><seg type="columnLine">eerily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your childhood pattern fits into sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion j-2364-k7.

The drapes helped deaden those</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds, and Kortha slept on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kortha, listen. When you came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fraysia to be a student at the Academy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You remember that first day when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">met--Guantra ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No, it had not been Guantra.

Was his memory that bad?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guantra standing before him, smiling at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, putting a friendly hand on his big</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm and saying, "You look like officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">material.

You have the build for it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And it was Guantra, not Hurlgut, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood with him, awed at the magic in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning parry and thrust of the sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand. He had defeated Mayram</seg><seg type="columnLine">the champion that afternoon as Guantra</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked on. Beaten him with a glittering</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword in his hand and a fire in his green</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and dancing joy in his heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He told Hurlgut--no, Guantra! about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it afterward in his rooms; how his father</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had him taught by Eric MacCormac</seg><seg type="columnLine">the American, who was tri-planet cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pion in all three weapons: foil, sabre and</seg><seg type="columnLine">epee. And Guantra listened, pleased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The voice went on, whispering softly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking to him, lifting from his memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">the threads of recollection, removing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very fibre of his character, as a mason</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifts old tile to lay the new. Bit after</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittering bit of fact was slipped in to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the place of memory. Fact that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so plausible it became the truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Guantra who had given him his</seg><seg type="columnLine">first engineering chance, in letting him</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge and electrolize the bastion of cliff-</seg><seg type="columnLine">works surrounding radio city Ruuzol. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">cables and generators, he had made those</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain ridges of solid metals the sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing board for a spacevox system that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">first in the solar system. Kortha had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great job on that, thanks to Guantra.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Later, there were other triumphs.

Their voices fled from wall to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, and sank into oblivion. The candle</seg><seg type="columnLine">that marked the hours and the days burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower. Only the voices lived, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeming brain of Kortha that was taught</seg><seg type="columnLine">by an unsleeping, patient, mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">teacher.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was still in the room when Kortha</seg><seg type="columnLine">woke.

You'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">think he was a baby, the way Guantra</seg><seg type="columnLine">humored him. Always giving him the best.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, that was the way of a friend for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. He clambered to his feet and rubbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms with his big, brown hands. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">candle was spluttering in its golden socket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kortha frowned. That candle had burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">for three days!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He must have been tired.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have no reason to leave Guantra,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. But he must have been very tired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three days asleep!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kortha searched among the drapes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking an exit. He found a tiny, moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped door opposite his couch. It opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">creakily under his palm, and he stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a tunnel. Lights switched on as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though by the heat of his body. He'</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked slowly, frowning. He did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember this passageway at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Water lapped at rock ahead of him.

Throughout its shadowy length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the haze that filled it was tinted blue, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the waters of this undersurface ocean</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazed like blue fire in its reflection. Azure</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalagmites thrust up gnarled arms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads in eerie grotesqueries. Ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him for mile after mile stretched that limpid</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea. Here and there a rock rose, wet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamy, above its blue surface. Shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloomed in the distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kortha fell to his knees at the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stone floor, fascinated by the water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He dipped a hand into it: felt it cool and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soothing on his flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Startled, he stared into its depths. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something moving down among those</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluish fires, something white and strange.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something was flashing through the water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swopping up toward his kneeling figure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw white flesh and tossing hair.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought I would be in time, but it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard trail up the mountains. We had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go on foot. I'm too late, too late!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kortha shoved her away from him</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly, snarling, "Save your blandish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, Use.

He looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kortha, too, and there was pity in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. Kortha did not fight with men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not walk to meet him. Did Guantra?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had the sharp, hard conviction that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must know the answer to that. It might</seg><seg type="columnLine">help him decide incongruities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KORTHA sighed. He wished that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could solve this enigma that turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">him inside-out in puzzlement. He found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself liking Ilse and Hurlgut, even know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing what he did to them; and learned he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was close, to hating Guantra. Guantra</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the power. Hurlgut was a cripple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ilse a girl. Could Guantra fight them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the armies and the fleets of Mars, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">still hold his head high? Could--he?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ilse stood at the open door, watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Kortha realized she had been stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing there for minutes, as he had thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He scowled, and muttered, "Get me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the magnifone. I'll speak to Guantra."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following Ilse to the lift, Kortha brooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zut, but she was lovely! If only</seg><seg type="columnLine">she were not the wanton he knew her</seg><seg type="columnLine">for. And yet--always that . . . and yet !</seg><seg type="columnLine">And yet, there was nothing of the wanton</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her.' The perfume from her fur</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolero floated around them in the lift. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminded him of things, that perfume: of</seg><seg type="columnLine">memories that were stored so deeply in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his subconscious that he had completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten them. Kisses over the canals in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a drifting 'coptondola. An Academy dance</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Ilse wearing a black, filmy thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the blue of her eyes and the silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair weirdly beautiful. And those nights</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they had eaten cold fruit and drank</seg><seg type="columnLine">ENGINES OF THE GODS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of iced bessa-mead in the palace gardens</seg><seg type="columnLine">near colored-water fountains, before he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">--before the guard had crippled Hurlgut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could not square remembered hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piness with other memories. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a leak somewhere. He had to learn more--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ilse," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lift was opening and the girl was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going down the corridor. Kortha shrugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">and followed her. He was probably mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken. Those memories were the over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flow from a forgotten dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the big control room he stood watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Ilse punch buttons. A beam-man</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at him from a corner panel-slot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let him look. The name of Kortha was</seg><seg type="columnLine">legendary on Mars. He heard Ilse say-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, "Guantra. Guantra!" into a fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">meshed magnifone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The screen above the panelling came</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive with the Premier's sneering, point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearded face; and his voice was harsh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"So. You got to Kortha before me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ilse. It is too bad. I would like to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether--let me speak to him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kortha stared up at Guantra's scowling</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. The man was worried. The way</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tongue licked unceasingly at his thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips, the hands tugging at the crested metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">buckle of his belt, the creases around his</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrowed eyes: they were signal flares</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing his anxiety. There was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">bothering Guantra, too, even as it both-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">What was it? Kortha had to know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kortha sucked in his breath, realizing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the duel was between him and Guantra.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each had knowledge, and they had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade to know where they stood. Guantra</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to be sure of what? Of his friend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship? But--why? He himself sought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">test that elusive memory of his. It told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him Ilse was wanton and Hurlgut a dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger; but his senses belittled that memory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps Guantra could be persuaded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give him the knowledge he sought. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">put Ilse aside, placed mouth to the mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nifone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kortha on the beam, Guantra. Tell me</seg><seg type="columnLine">something. Am I your friend, Guantra?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man with the jutting beard licked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his lips for a split second, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">long enough. Kortha knew now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guantra did not know! That meant that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his senses might be right, after all; that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his memory was wrong. And if his mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ory were wrong, then Ilse and Hurlgut</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not what he thought them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He listened to Guantra bluster, calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to him to recall and act on their old</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendship. Smiling grimly, he leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer to the image on the screen. Test</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, Kortha!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me broadcast to all Mars, Guantra.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let me tell Mars that we are friends."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No," said Guantra swiftly. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be politic right now. Better</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you and I should meet, Kortha.' Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard my flagship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afraid of what he might say, the Pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mier would not let him speak to Mars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kortha wanted to know the reason why</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guantra doubted their friendship. Look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the cold austerity, the pride and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambition of the man as marked in the lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his. face and the manner of his bear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, Kortha rather thought the reason was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not Ilse. A man like Guantra would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">bother so about a woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will broadcast, Guantra," Kortha said</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. I will have to stop that, my friend.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I cannot allow it, until I have seen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken with you, face to face. I am com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in for you now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They saw the Premier reach out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">break connection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kortha looked at the blank screen; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled on Ilse, and his big hands went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to catch her by the shoulders and bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">her up close to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said savagely, "Tell me! Tell me</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I don't know. Why has Guantra</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned against me? Why does he doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friendship? It can't be over you. Pie</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not the man to endanger his power for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman. What is his reason?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her blue eyes were unafraid. She said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Guantra was never your friend. I dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">not tell you before, but I can now because</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have doubts of what your memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">tells you. You saw how indecisive he was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He does not know whether his psycho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">analyser in the Blue Grotto had time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">change you.

Only Kor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tha doubted, and that was because Ilse</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to him before Guantra. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up the thread of his life at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smithy in the desert and went on with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once he interrupted, with, "But it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hurlgut who sent men to kill me in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower of Zut?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ilse scorned that, "Hurlgut send men?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who on Mars would serve a cripple when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guantra rules the fleets?

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was built by the Ancients, who understood</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mind as well as other sciences. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that the memory cells that gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern many of our habits and thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be altered by hypnotically suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">alterations.

They made eerie trac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eries of light over the city as the guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">spouted lightning again and again. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">glassite dome was bathed in a white, lumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nescent glow from the nets of meshed</seg><seg type="columnLine">zigzags in the air above it, that ran in</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaks of jagged white fire all around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And always the lightnings grounded on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plains.

However, your evil genius can plan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it can't work miracles all the time. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">--you imp of Zut's black brother, you!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kortha laughed in his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The screen went dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineers w'ent dead, too, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kortha sent his booming laugh out at</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, shouting, "Let him bring his fleet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's the showdown fight we want.

He stumbled over the threshold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kept licking his lips helplessly. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ilse saw his eyes, she knew suddenly what</seg><seg type="columnLine">an enemy Kortha was. From the eyes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guantra came the look that a slave might</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast to an adored idol that came to life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thundered curses on him.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand came across in a blur of mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion : struck like a piston against Guantra's</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw.

Kortha stared down at Guan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tra, grim-faced, silent. He sighed once</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they were finished, and looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ilse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I never knew," he said to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke to the officers, "It was true,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">came at last to the first waterfall, a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocky shelf that lifted but five feet above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green floor of swampy thidin vines</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the grayish ooze that floored them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The firmness of rock was welcome un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derfoot.

They chose the larger stream on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right and paddled between low sullen</seg><seg type="columnLine">black cliffs of basalt for perhaps another</seg><seg type="columnLine">three miles. Here a lake spread outward</seg><seg type="columnLine">fanwise from three giant cataracts that</seg><seg type="columnLine">boomed and frothed as they poured over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sheer hundred-foot precipice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">36	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Power," said Masson.

They worked listlessly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopelessly. What was there to work for</seg><seg type="columnLine">now?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So the old women of the tribes carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eggs away and hid them?" Masson</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubbed the unlovely flesh of his jowls</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully. "They were forbidden to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow.

Masson and Joe Dolan lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of the slow-moving party of Frogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">at times as they moved along the rim of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deep slot. And as they followed, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor of the ravine fell further away be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath them; they were climbing high into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stunted cliffs and peaks of Tular's</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Night came and they slept above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopping place of the ten Butrad ancients.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And with morning they pushed upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the soupy fog again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly the upward slanting slope</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended. They looked out over a roughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">oval bowl of slowly writhing mist and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dimly they saw the floor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavity. Several hundred acres of jungle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad raggedness. Miniature buttes, mesas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cliffs split the bowl into a hell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken terrain, and here and there, near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black pocks of caverns in the rimming</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff walls, there showed little huddles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Butrad huts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Place of Birth," Masson said</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. "All the tribes of the island must</seg><seg type="columnLine">come here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolan nodded and rubbed the palm of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand over the whetted edge of his hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing knife. "Plenty of guards stationed</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the only entrances, he said, "just</seg><seg type="columnLine">SURVIVAL	39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> as you expected.

"That would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> warn them.

His webbed gray hand swept in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a short arc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Some of those caves must have other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> entrances.

"Right you are," he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> agreed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "My theory is," Masson said, "that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Venus was formerly much warmer than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> it is now. For that reason the incubation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> temperature must be artificially raised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The question is: how much and how long</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> must the eggs be artificially warmed.

"You seem to find your way around</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the jungle easy as a native."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Huh," snorted Dolan. "Ten years</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> hammering the pavements and dodging</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> traffic does that. You gotta have a quick</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> eye and remember what you're doing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Masson got to his feet and moved back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> from the brink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Let's start hunting," he suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They crouched together in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the dark shadows of the tunnel that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> opened a dozen feet above the floor of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> large cavern. Down there, in the gray</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> half-light that filtered in through the outer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> entrance, they saw three small heaps of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> vegetation steaming silently and the two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> old females who tended them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   From time to time one of the old fe-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> males filled a hollow husk from the nik-nik</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> fruit with water and sprinkled it over the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> three mounds. The eggs they had seen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the ancient ones bury so carefully were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> soaking up the moist warmth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Masson jogged Dolan's elbow, and they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> crawled carefully back along the low-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> roofed passage toward the vine-festooned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> entrance five hundred feet above. Water</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and gray ooze sloshed underfoot as they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> walked along level reaches of the way,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and always the wet rock was slippery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We know how the eggs are hatched</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">now," he said, 'and with experience we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can learn to gauge the proper tempera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. But until we have perfected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">procedure our families will not increase</seg><seg type="columnLine">very rapidly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolan gulped. "I dunno if I want one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them ugly looking things we saw in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that side pen," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're no uglier than you are, Joe,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled Masson.

He gripped Dolan's arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But that's what I was thinking about,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went on. "About that side pen in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave where the newly hatched Butrads are</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept.

"Be seeing you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A turn in the ascending tunnel smoth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the last low-sopken words, and Masson</seg><seg type="columnLine">was left alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blind men came into the cavern at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction of the wrinkled old hags.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They carefully stripped away layer upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">layer of vegetation from the smallest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brownest mound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Masson leaned further out over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rim of the hole above the cavern floor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch. He had feared that the party of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men from the crater would arrive before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could see the uncovering of a mound</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the hatching of the Frog eggs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last layer of thidin and grass came</seg><seg type="columnLine">away and perhaps a hundred of the leath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">40	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ery bluish ovoids lay revealed on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">steaming warm nest. They were shape-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less and limply alive now, that leather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard outer shell rendered soft and rotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the steady warmth of the heating vege-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation. Masson saw two tiny monsters</seg><seg type="columnLine">already free from their outgrown prisons</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the blind men began scooping them up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carrying them to the empty pen beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ones already occupied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young Butrads set up a throaty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarse bellowing that made the cave</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrate. It was not their feeding time</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the excitement had aroused them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they knew but this one way to exress</seg><seg type="columnLine">their displeasure. Masson started to crawl</seg><seg type="columnLine">back from the passage's outer lip even as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two old females started throwing thidin</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoots and scraps of raw fish to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screeching young ones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the rotten gray rock betrayed him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A dozen times in the past eight days he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had leaned out over the rim to watch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a dozen times the rock had supported</seg><seg type="columnLine">his weight. But this time it went scaling</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, a great slab of it, and with it went</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Earthman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE blind men whirled from the half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">full pen and came lunging at him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">old females screeched throaty harsh orders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Masson raised the gun that he some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how had managed to cling to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go back," he ordered in the language</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Butrads, ''go out of the cave before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I kill."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is but one," croaked the ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones, "destroy the desecrator of the Place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Birth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now Masson could see that the eyes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the four Frog males had been neatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gouged from their sockets in days past.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Probably they were blinded that they might</seg><seg type="columnLine">not see the forbidden magic of the eggs</seg><seg type="columnLine">that became Frogs. Or perhaps they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinded that the)' might not escape from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the birth caves into the outer jungles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet in the semi-gloom of the cave they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not at too great a disadvantage. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened for the movement of Masson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, and the breath of his lungs guided</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The young of the Butrads were</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent, too. The sudden quiet was a roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They closed in, great chunks of stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched in their fists. A Frog with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but a club or a crude spear would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been beaten. But the puny hollow tube of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal that the Earthman carried held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength of many heavy clubs and many</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge rocks in its miniature pebbles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped copper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Masson fired and a Frog went down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other three came on uncertainly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fired again. The two remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">Butrads stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are many of them, Old Ones,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them cried. "They have struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">down Trew and Brun with thunder."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is only one!" cried the wrinkled</seg><seg type="columnLine">old females.

"I have captured the thunder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With it I strike you down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blind men hesitated, and Masson</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent a bullet smoking between their legs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They backed away toward the entrance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the females with them. And a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later Masson was piling fragments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock and crumbling shale into a barricade</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the cavern's mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could hold them off for a time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, until night at least, even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they brought the guards from the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrances to the bowl to aid the blind men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again and again the guards had at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked the cave where Masson lay holed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. All that day they had come crawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the dense matted growth to launch</seg><seg type="columnLine">their arrows and spears at him. Fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">or sixty of them there had been, he esti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mated, and at least forty blood-hungry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Butrads still faced him. These were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer guards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the coming of night the blinded</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers of the caves would join them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their uncanny sense of hearing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch they would overrun the cave. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frogs were not a cowardly race, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">invasion into this, their most taboo and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacred place, made them all the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">fanatical in their hatred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Masson had until night.

Stuart, swung on, searching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the empty skies, and now a queer, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasoning excitement began to grow within</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. At least, before he died, he'd learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the Aesir were like. It probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be pleasant knowledge, but there'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">be some satisfaction in it. And there'd be</seg><seg type="columnLine">even more satisfaction if he thought he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a chance of smashing a hard fist into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of one of the Aesir priests--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">even--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hell, why not? He had nothing to lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. From the moment he had touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asgard soil, he was damned anyway. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one thing Stuart was certain; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be led like a helpless sheep to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat-cutting. He wouldn't die without</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting against them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The forest thinnned before him. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a flicker of swift motion far ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stuart froze, his grip tightening on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cudgel, his eyes searching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Between the columnar trees, bright amid</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purple shadows, a glitter of sparkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">nebulae swept. A web of light, Stuart</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought--so dazzling his eyes ached as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at the--the thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bodiless, intangible, the shifting net of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars poised, high above his head. Hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of twinkling, glittering pinpoints</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickered there, so swiftly it seemed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though an arabesque spider-web of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">weaved in the still, dark air--web of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norns!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each flickering star-fleck--watched. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as the thing poised, a horrible, half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">human hesitancy in its stillness, a deep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">humming note sounded, from its starry</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Star-points shook and quivered to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound. Again it came--deeper, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">menacing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Questioning!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was this one of the--Watchers? Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">this one of them?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ABRUPTLY its hesitancy vanished; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept down upon Stuart. Instinc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively he swung his cudgel in a smashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow that sent him reeling forward--for</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no resistance. The star-creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as intangible as air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet it was not. The dazzling web</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light enfolded him like a blazing cloak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly a cold, trembling horror crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">along his skin. Bodiless the thing might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be--but it was dangerous, infinitely so!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pressure, shifting, quicksand pressure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all about him. That stealthy cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept into his flesh and bones, frigid icicles</seg><seg type="columnLine">jabbing into his brain. Gasping with</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock, Stuart struck out. He had dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the club. Now he stooped and groped for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, but he could see nothing except a glit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering veil of diamonds that raced like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad torrent everywhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The humming rose again--ominously</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumphant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cursing, Stuart staggered forward. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">star-cloak stayed. He tried to grip it</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere, to wrench it free, but he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not. The thousands of tiny eyes raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">past him, -glittering with alien ecstasy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining brighter and ever brighter as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt the life being sucked out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. . . . Deeper stabbed the gelid cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . louder roared that throbbing tone in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard his voice gasping furious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopeless oaths. His eyes ached with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain of staring at that blinding glitter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The heart of the Watcher. Crush the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The words crashed like deep thunder in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brain. Had someone spoken them--?</seg><seg type="columnLine">No . . . for, with the command, had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">a message as well. As though a thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spoken within his mind, a telepathic</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning from--where?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes strained at the dazzle. Now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that there was a brighter core that did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not shift and change when the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">star-cloud wove its dreadful net. A spot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light that--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reached out . . . the nucleus darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">away ... he lurched forward, on legs half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">frozen, and felt a stone turn under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot. As he crashed down, his hand closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tightened on something warm and liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that pulsed frantically against his palm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">54</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The humming rose to a shrill scream . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened . . . warning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stuart tightened his grip. He lay mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionless, his eyes closed. But all around</seg><seg type="columnLine">him he could feel the icy tendrils of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">star-thing lashing at him, drinking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">human warmth, probing with avid fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt that warm--core--writhe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to slip between his fingers. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeezed . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scream burst out, an inhuman agony</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its raw-edged keening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In Stuart's hand was--nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He opened his eyes. The dazzling glit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of star-points had vanished. Only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest, with its purple shadows, lay empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and silent around him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stuart got up slowly, swallowed dry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">throated. The creatures of the Aesir were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not invulnerable, then. Not to one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew their weaknesses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How had he known?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What voice had spoken in his brain?</seg><seg type="columnLine">There had been an odd, impossible fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliarity to that--that mental voice, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he remembered it.

He felt suddenly cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain that he would find the Aesir in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took a hesitant step--and another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And with each step, a queer, unmotivated</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence poured into him. As though</seg><seg type="columnLine">some barrier in his mind had broken down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">letting some strange flood of proud de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiance rush in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was impossible.

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were worse things than the starry Watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers here, if legends were to be trusted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He went on, the curious tide of defiance</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising higher and ever higher in his blood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a strangely intoxicating sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">--of pure, crazy self-confidence such as no</seg><seg type="columnLine">man should rightfully have felt on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunted asteroid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wondered--but the drunkenness</seg><seg type="columnLine">was such that he did not wonder much.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thought: To hell with the Aesir!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The forest ended. At his feet a road</seg><seg type="columnLine">began, leading off into the purple horizons</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the flat plain before him. At the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that road was a thrusting pillar of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rose like a tower toward the dark sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There were the Aesir. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EVERY spaceman has an automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of orientation. In ancient days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when clipper ships sailed the seas of Earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Yankee skippers knew the decks be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath their feet, and they knew the stars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Southern Cross or Pole Star told them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">what latitudes they sailed. In unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters, they still had their familiar keels</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the familiar stars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it is with the spacemen who drift</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Pluto to Mercury Darkside, trusting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to metal hulls that shut in the air and shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the vast abysses of interplanetary space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When thej' work outship, a glance at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky will tell a trained man where he is--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and only tough, trained men survive the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous commerce of space. On Mercury</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blazing solar corona flames above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon; on clouded Venus the green star</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Earth shines sometimes. .On Io, Callisto,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ganymede, a man can orient himself by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic mother planet--Saturn or Jupiter</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and in the Asteroid Belt, there is always</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange procession of little worlds like</seg><seg type="columnLine">lanterns, some half-shadowed, others</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly reflecting the Sun's glare. Any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where in the System the sky is friendly--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Except on Asgard. Jupiter was too far</seg><seg type="columnLine">and too small; Mars was scarcely visible;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Asteroid Belt not much thicker than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Milky Way. The unfamiliar magni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tudes of the planets told Stuart, very</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely, that he was on unknown territory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was without the sure, safe anchor that</seg><seg type="columnLine">spacemen depend upon, and that lack told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him how utterly he stood alone now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the unreasoning confidence did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">flag. If anything, it mounted stronger</seg><seg type="columnLine">within him as he hurried along the road,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rangy legs eating up the miles with easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. The sooner he reached his goal, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">better he'd like it. Nor did he wish to en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter any more of the Aesir's guardians</seg><seg type="columnLine">--his business was with the Aesir!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tower of light grew taller as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on. Now he saw that it was a cluster</seg><seg type="columnLine">WEI AT HATH. ME?	55</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of buildings, massed cylinders of varying</seg><seg type="columnLine">heights, each one gigantic in diameter as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as height, and all shining with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold, shadowless radiance that apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from the stone--or metal--itself. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">road led directly to the base of the tallest</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It ran between shining pillars--a gate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less threshold--and was lost in silvery</seg><seg type="columnLine">mists. No bars were needed to keep visitors</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of this fortress!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Briefly a cool wind of doubt blew upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stuart. He hesitated, wishing he had at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least his blaster gun. But he was unarmed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had even left the club back in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The red moon was sinking.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze could not pierce the mists beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the portal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stepped forward--between the twin</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillars.

But all around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">between monstrous pillars, were set</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrones, ebon thrones fifty feet tall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the thrones sat giants!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Titan figures, armored in glittering mail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringed Stuart, and instantly his mind fled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to half-forgotten folk-lore. .. .Asgard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jotunheim, the lands of the giants and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gods. Thor and Odin, sly Loki and Baldur</seg><seg type="columnLine">--they were all here, he thought, bearded</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossi roaring their black laughter into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking air of the hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Watching him from their height--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he looked up, and the giants were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwarfed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chamber was roofless. At least he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see no roof.

The sheer magnitude of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower made Stuart's mind rock dizzily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still the laughter roared out. But now</seg><seg type="columnLine">it died. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thundered through the hall a voice . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep . . . resonant . . . the voice of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aesir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A human, brother!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye!

Stuart slanted a glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward. The silver mists had dissi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pated now, and he could see that the abyess</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not bottomless. Its floor was fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet below the surface on which he stood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a dozen figures were visible beneath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stood motionless--like statues.

Another Earthman--a thin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale, clerklike fellow. A white-skinned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">handsome Callistan native, looking like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apollo, and, like all Callistans, harboring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cold savagery of a demon behind that</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth mask.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A dozen of them--drawn from all parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the System.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">redbeard was watching Stuart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His courage flags," the great voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">boomed. "Speak the truth, Earthman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Have you courage to face the gods?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stuart stubbornly refused to answer.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw a black horse standing above him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the slope, pawing the ground and look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at him with red eyes. And an old,</seg><seg type="columnLine">old terror came flooding over him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had not remembered for a quarter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a century. A boy's acute and sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Who had opened the doors of his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and laid this secret bare?

But the fear was long</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone now, long gone. . . . Was it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then whence had come this monstrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">black stallion that pawed the floor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall, glaring down red-eyed at him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing teeth like fangs? No horse, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a monster in the shape of a horse, a mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster ten feet high at the shoulder, wear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the shape of his boyhood nightmare</seg><seg type="columnLine">that woke in Stuart even now the old,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unreasoning horror. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was stamping down upon him, shak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing its bridled head, snorting, lifting its</seg><seg type="columnLine">lip above the impossible teeth. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reins hanging loose, he saw the sad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle and the swinging stirrups. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the only safety in this hall for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">was paradoxically upon the nightmare's</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, where the hoofs and fangs could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach him. But the terror and revulsion</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the boy had buried long ago came</seg><seg type="columnLine">welling up from founts deep-buried in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's subconscious mind. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOW it was rushing him, head like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a snake's outthrust, hissing like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake, reins flying like Medusa-locks as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it stretched to seize him. For one instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stood there paralyzed. He had faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangers on many worlds to which this</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightmare was nothing, but he had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">since boyhood felt the paralysis of horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gripped him now. It was a child's</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror, resurrected from the caves of sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ruin him. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a superhuman effort he Broke that</seg><seg type="columnLine">frozen fear, snatching for the flying reins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling as the monstrous thing swept past</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in a thunder of terrifying hoofs. Des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perately he clung to the reins, and as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing rushed by he somehow got a clutch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hand upon the saddle-horn and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stirrup that swung sickeningly when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">took his weight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he was in the saddle, dizzy still</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the terrors of childhood, but astride</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nightmare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now, with a sudden intoxicating</seg><seg type="columnLine">clarity, the fear fell from his mind. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant he sat high on the back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible fanged thing, an old, old terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing from his mind. Confidence which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, he knew, his own and no bodiless</seg><seg type="columnLine">reassurance drawn from dreams, such as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he had felt in the jungle, flooded warmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through him. He was not afraid any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more--he would never be afraid. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">festering terror buried deep in his child-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood had come to light at last and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiped away. He caught the reins tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flashed a sudden grin around the hall--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brazen laughter boomed through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building. And beneath his knees Stuart</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the horse's body alter incredibly. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he was gripping a solid, warm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleshed, hairy thing whose body had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar pitch and motion beneath the sad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle. Then, then--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Indescribably the body writhed under</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The warm hairy flesh flowed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed. Cold struck through leatheroid</seg><seg type="columnLine">58	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">against his thighs, and it was a smooth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouring cold of many alien muscles work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing powerfully together in a way no mam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal knows. He looked down. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was riding a monstrous snake that</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted its head to look at him in the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment he realized what had happened. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">great diamond-shaped head towered high</seg><seg type="columnLine">and came looping down toward him, wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthed, tongue like a flame flicker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It laid its cold, smooth cheek against</seg><seg type="columnLine">his with a hideous caressing motion, slid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing around his neck, sliding down his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and side, laying a loop of cold, scaly</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength around him and pressing, press-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hands closed around the thickness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its throat, futilely--and the throat melted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his grasp and was hairly with a hairiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">no mammal ever knew. The motion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body he bestrode changed again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was incredibly springy and light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rode a monstrous spider. His hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">were sunk wrist-deep in loathsome coarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair, and his eyes stared into great cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">faceted eyes that mirrored his own face</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousandfold. He saw his own dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torted features looking back at him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless miniatures, but behind the faces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the great eyes of the spider, he saw no</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness regarding him. The cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">multiple eyes were not aware of Derek</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stuart. Behind the shield of its terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">face the spider shut away its own arach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nid thoughts and the memories of the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields of Mars that were its home. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreadful, impersonal aloofness its mandi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bles gaped forward toward its prey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Loathing ran in waves of weakness</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Stuart's whole body, but he shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes and blindly struck out at the nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those great mirroring eyes, feeling wet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness shatter against his fist as--as--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the horror shifted and vanished, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">rippling waves of green light darkened all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him. Now they coagulated, drew to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether into a meadow, cool with Earthly</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass, bordered by familiar trees far away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Primroses gleamed here and there. Above</seg><seg type="columnLine">him was the blue sky and the warm bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun that shone only upon the hills of Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what he felt was horror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twenty feet from him was a rank, round-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed patch of weeds. His gaze was drawn in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">exorably to that spot. And it was from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">there that the crawling dread reached out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Faintly he heard laughter ... of the gods</seg><seg type="columnLine">... of the Aesir. The Aesir ? Who--what</seg><seg type="columnLine">were they? How had he, Derek Stuart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever heard of them except as a name whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered in fear as the spaceships streaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the clouds above that Dakota farm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Derek Stuart ... a boy of eleven. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But--but--that was wrong, somehow. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't a child any more. He had matured,</seg><seg type="columnLine">become a spaceman--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dreams. The dreams of an eleven-year-</seg><seg type="columnLine">old.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet the hollow, dreadful laughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">throbbed somewhere, in the vaults of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue overhead, in the solidity of the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground beneath him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This had happened before. It had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to a boy in South Dakota--a boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had not known what lay concealed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that verdant clump of weeds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now, somehow--and very strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">--Stuart knew what he would find there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was afraid. Horribly, sickeningly</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid. Cold nausea crawled up his spine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the calves of his legs. He wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn and run to the farmhouse half a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. He almost turned, and then paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the distant laughter grew louder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They wanted him to run. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to scare him--and, once the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fenses of his courage had broken, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be lost. Stuart knew that with an icy cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somewhere, very far away, he sensed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man standing in a cyclopean hall--a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ragged spaceman's garb, hard-faced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin-lipped, angry-eyed. A familiar figure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man was urging him on--telling him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go on toward that clump of weeds--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Derek Stuart obeyed the voiceless com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand. His throat dry, his heart pumping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he forced himself across the meadow till</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stood at his goal and looked down at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody, twisted corpse of the tramp who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been knifed by another hobo, twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years before, on that Dakota farm. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">old nausea of shocked horror took him by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throat and strangled him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fought it down. This time he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">run screaming back to the farmhouse. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And suddenly the laughter of the gods</seg><seg type="columnLine">was stilled. Derek Stuart, a man once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mind, stood again in the tower of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHAT HATH ME?	59</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Aesir. The thrones between the monstrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillars were vacant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Aesir were gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STUART let out his breath in a long sigh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had no illusions about the vanish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the Aesir; he knew he had not con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quered those mighty beings. It would take</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than human powers to do that. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least he had a respite. All but the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolid spacemen develop hypertension, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there seems to be a curious mathematical</seg><seg type="columnLine">rule about that; it increases according to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distance from the Sun. Which may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be explained by the fact that environmental</seg><seg type="columnLine">differences also increase as the outer planets</seg><seg type="columnLine">are reached---and alien environments breed</seg><seg type="columnLine">alien creatures. A great many men have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone insane on Pluto. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was not Pluto; it was nearer Sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward than Jupiter, but the utter alienage</seg><seg type="columnLine">that brooded over Asgard was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">palpable. Even the solidity under Stuart's</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, the very stones of the planetoid, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">artifically created, by a science a million</seg><seg type="columnLine">years beyond that of his own time. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Aesir--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unexpectedly his deep chest shook with</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter. The inexplicable self-confidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had first come to him in the Asgard</seg><seg type="columnLine">forests had not waned; it seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown even stronger since his meeting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Aesir giants.- Now he stared around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the colossal hall, his eyes straining toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot of light far above where those</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible columns converged. His own</seg><seg type="columnLine">insignificance by comparison did not trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whether or not he could have the slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est hope of winning this game--at least he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was giving his enemies a run for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">money!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A sound from the pit roused him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stuart walked warily toward the edge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The dozen motionless figures were still</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, fifty feet below, and among them</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one he had not noticed before--an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthgirl, he thought, with curling dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair framing a white face as she tilted up</seg><seg type="columnLine">her chin and stared at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this distance he could make out few</seg><seg type="columnLine">details; she wore a close-fitting green suit</seg><seg type="columnLine">which left slender arms and legs bare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Earthman--" she said, in a clear, carry-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing voice. "Earthman! Quick! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aesir will be back--go now! Leave their</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple before they--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't waste your breath," Stuart said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is Asgard." Whoever the girl was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she should know the impossibility of leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the taboo world. "If I can find a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said quickly, "You won't find one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not here, in the temple."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How can I get you out of there? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're mad," the girl said.

"Better to die at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stuart narrowed his eyes at the dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">frozen figures. "I don't think so. Four-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen of us can put up a better fight than</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. If your friends wake up--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl said, "On your left, between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pillars, there's a tapestry showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perseus and the Gorgon.

He whirled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran toward the distant wall, whex*e he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the Perseus tapestry, brown and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold, a huge curtain between two columns.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the Aesir saw, they made no move. . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stuart's lips twisted in a bitter smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crazy confidence had not left him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he was conscious of a reassuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmth; at least he was no longer com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely alone. That would help. Between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the worlds, and on the desolate planets</seg><seg type="columnLine">that swing along the edge of the System,</seg><seg type="columnLine">loneliness is the lurking terror, more hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible than the most exotic monster ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">spawned by the radioactive Plutonian earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He touched the tapestry twice; it swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from him, and a staircase was visible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading down through stone or metal--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not tell which. Stuart fought back</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impulse that urged him to race down</seg><seg type="columnLine">those curving spiral steps. The girl had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken of traps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went warily, testing each tread be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he put his weight upon it. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not think that the snares of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aesir would be so simple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the bottom, he emerged into a vaulted</seg><seg type="columnLine">60	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber, tiny by comparison with the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had left. It was oval, domed ceiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walls and floor shining with a milky</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiance--except at one spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There he saw a door--transparent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through it he looked into the pit. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on a level with the floor of that shaft</seg><seg type="columnLine">now; he could see the dozen figures still</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing motionless in a huddled group,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a few feet beyond the glassy pane</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the Earthgirl. She was looking di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly at him, but her dark eyes had a blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking, as though the door was opaque</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stuart paused, his hand on the compli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated mechanism that, he guessed, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">open the portal. His hard, dark face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impassive, but he was conscious of an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar stirring deep within him. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">above, he had not seen the girl's beauty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw it now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE couldn't be an Earthgirl--entirely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She must be one of those disturbingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lovely interplanetary halfbreeds. Earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood she had, of course, and predomi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nantly, but there was something more, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pure essence of beauty that blazed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">her like a flame kindled in a lamp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystal. In all his wanderings between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worlds, Stuart had never seen a girl as</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathtakingly lovely as this one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hand moved on the controls: the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door slid silently open. The girl's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightened. She gave a little gasp and ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him. Without question she sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">refuge in his arms, and for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stuart held her--not unwillingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thrust her away gently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The others."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said, "It's useless.

Uneasiness crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">along his spine as he did so. The Aesir</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be watching from above, or--or--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was nothing. Only dead silence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the uneven breathing of the girl as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she stood in the doorway watching. Stuart</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped before the leather-clad Earthman</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tested a burly arm. The man stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">frozen, his flesh cold and hard as stone, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes staring glassily. He was not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So with the others. Stuart grimaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shrugged. He turned back toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl, and felt a pulse of relief as he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped into the shining chamber. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be no safer here, but at least he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't so conscious of inhuman eyes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be watching from above. Not that</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid stone might be any barrier to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aesir's probing gaze. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl touched the mechanism; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door slid silently shut. "It's no use," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "The paralysis holds all the others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only I could battle it--a little. And that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was because--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Save it," Stuart said. He turned toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door by which he had entered, but an</seg><seg type="columnLine">urgent hand gripped his wrist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me talk," the quiet voice said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We're as safe here as anywhere. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">there may be a way--now that I can think</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A way out? A safe way?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a haunted look in her dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. "I don't know. I've lived here</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a long time. The others--" she pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the door of the pit. "The sacrifices</seg><seg type="columnLine">were brought to Asgard only yesterday.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I've been here many moons. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aesir kept me alive for a bit, to amuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Then they tired, and I was thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">in with the others. But I learned a little.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I--I--no one can dwell here in the Aesir</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronghold without--changing a little.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's why the paralysis didn't hold me</seg><seg type="columnLine">as long as it holds the others."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can we save them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," she said, with a small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless shrug. "I don't even know if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can save ourselves. It's been so long</seg><seg type="columnLine">since I was brought to Asgard that I--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely remember my life before that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I have learned a little of the Aesir--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that may help us now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stuart watched her. She tried to smile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not successfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said, "I'm Kari. The rest--I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten. You're--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Derek Stuart."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me what happened."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We haven't time," Stuart said impa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiently, but Kari shook her head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"We'll need weapons, and I must know</seg><seg type="columnLine">--first--if you can use them. Tell me!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, she was right. She had knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Stuart needed. So he told her, very</seg><seg type="columnLine">briefly, what he remembered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stared at him. "Voices--in yOur</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something like that. I don't know--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHAT HATH ME?	61</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No. No. Or--wait--" He tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">focus his thoughts upon a far, faint call-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that came from infinite distances. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">name. An urgent summons--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It faded and was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's nothing," Stuart said finally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Kari moved her shoulders uneasily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No help there, then."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me one thing. What's the Aesir's</seg><seg type="columnLine">power ? Hypnotism ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," Kari said, "or not entirely. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">can make thoughts into real things. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are--what the race of man will evolve</seg><seg type="columnLine">into in a million years. And they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed, into beings utterly alien to</seg><seg type="columnLine">humans."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They looked human--giants, though."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They can assume any shape," Kari</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him. "Their real form is unimagin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able.

"Instead, they hammered at</seg><seg type="columnLine">your weaknesses--old fears that hung on</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you for years. Experiences that fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened you in the past. They sent your mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into that past--but you were too</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong for them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Too strong--?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then. They have other powers, Stuart</seg><seg type="columnLine">--incredible powers. You can't fight them</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. And you must fight them. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand years no one has dared--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Stuart remembered something. "Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">dared--once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KARI nodded. "I know. I know the</seg><seg type="columnLine">legends, anyway. About John Starr</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Lorna. The great rebels who first</seg><seg type="columnLine">defied the Aesir when the tyranny began.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they may have been only legendary</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures.

And they're a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand years dead. But it shows something</seg><seg type="columnLine">--to me at least. Man wasn't meant to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slave to these monsters. Rebellion--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kari watched him. Stuart's eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "John Starr and Lorna," he whispered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I wonder what their world was like, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand years ago? We've got all the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">worlds now, all the planets of the System</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Jupiter to the smallest asteroid. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we don't rule them, as men owned their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own Earth in those days. We're slaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Aesir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Aesir are--are gods."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "John Starr didn't think so," Stuart</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Neither do I. And at worst I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can always die, as he did. Listen, Kari."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He gripped her arms. "Think. You've</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived here for a while. Is there any weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">against those devils?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She met his gaze steadily. "Yes," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "But--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it? Where?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly Kari's face changed. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed herself against Stuart, avoiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips, simply seeking--he knew--warmth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and companionship. She was crying softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So long--" Kari whispered, her arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight around him. "I've been here so long</seg><seg type="columnLine">--with the gods. And I'm so lonely, Derek</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stuart. So lonely for green fields and fires</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the blue sky. I wish--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll see Earth again," Stuart prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ised. At that Kari pulled away. Her strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-breed loveliness was never more real</seg><seg type="columnLine">than then, with tears sparkling on her dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashes, and her mouth trembling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said, a catch in her voice, "I'll show</seg><seg type="columnLine">you the weapon, Stuart."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned toward the wall. Her hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved in a quick gesture. A panel opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in the glowing surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kari reached in, and when she withdrew</seg><seg type="columnLine">her arm, it was as though she held a torrent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blood that poured down from her grip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a cloak, Stuart saw, made of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">material so fine that it rippled like water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its crimson violence was bizarre against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cool green of Kari's garment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This cloak--" she said. "You must</seg><seg type="columnLine">wear it if we face the Aesir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stuart grimaced. "What good is a piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cloth ? A blaster gun's what I want."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A blaster wouldn't help," Kari said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is more than a piece of cloth, Stuart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is half alive--made so by the sciences</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Aesir. Wear it! It will protect you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She swung the great, scarlet billows</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Stuart's shoulders. Her fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumbled with the clasp at his throat. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She lies!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The desperate urgency of the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared through Stuart's mind. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">62</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that soundless voice, so sharp now with</seg><seg type="columnLine">violent intensity. His hands came up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rip the cloak from him--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was too late. Kari sprang back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide-eyed, as the fastenings of the cloak</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightened like a noose about Stuart's neck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt a stinging shock that ran like white</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire along his spine and up into his brain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One instant of blazing disorientation, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopeless, despairing cry in his mind--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">double cry, as of two telepathetic voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and then, his muscles too weak to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he crashed down upon the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not paralysis. He was simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">drained of all strength. There was pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure about his throat, cold flames along his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spine and in his brain, and he could feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">the texture of the cloak wrapped about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, striking through his spaceman's garb</seg><seg type="columnLine">--tingling, sentient, half-alive!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He whispered an oath. Kari's face had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not changed. He read something strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">like pity in her dark eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the gap in the wall whence she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had drawn the cloak came a figure, cloaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in black, a jet cowl hiding its head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">face completely. It was taller than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl by a foot. It shuffled forward with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an odd, rocking gait, and paused near her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stuart whispered, "I--should have re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered. The--the Aesir can change</seg><seg type="columnLine">their shapes. Those giants I saw weren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">real. And neither are you--not even hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kari shook her head. "I am real," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said slowly. "He is not." She gestured</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the black-cloaked figure. "But we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are all of the Aesir. And, as we thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were sent by the Protectors. Now your</seg><seg type="columnLine">power is gone, and you must walk the Long</seg><seg type="columnLine">Orbit with the other captives."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cowled creature came forward. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent, but Stuart could see nothing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of the hood. A fold of cloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhed out and touched Stuart's forehead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Darkness wrapped him like the shroud</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the scarlet cloak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a long time he had only his thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">for company. They were not pleasant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt alone, as he had never felt so</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly lonely and deserted before any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where in the System. Now he realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">even since his landing on Asgard, he had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had companionship of a sort--that the twin</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices murmuring in his brain had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">more real than he had realized. A living</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmth, a sense of--of presence--had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was gone now. Its absence left</seg><seg type="columnLine">a black void within him. He stood alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Kari. ... If he saw her again</seg><seg type="columnLine">when his hands were free, he would kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. He knew that. But--but her shin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing smile lightened the darkness that en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulfed him now. He had never seen love-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liness like Kari's, and he had known so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many women, so many, too many. ... A</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who has fought his way Sunward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">back again by way of Pluto's chasmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">midnight is not so easily misled by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile of a pretty woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kari was no ordinary woman--God</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew she was not! Perhaps not even hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, perhaps not even real at all. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be that very touch of alienage that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamped her shining image upon his memory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he could not put the image aside now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw her clearly in the darkness of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">captivity and the deeper dark of his lone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liness, now that the voices were stilled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lovely, exotic, with the eyes full of longing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and terror--what lies they told!--and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lovely, that dazzling smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bitterness made a wry taste in his mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Either she was one of the Aesir, or she</seg><seg type="columnLine">served them. Served them well. A knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the heart was the only answer he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her, and he meant to give her that</seg><seg type="columnLine">edged answer if he lived. But she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so very lovely. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly the veil of darkness lifted. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a face he had seen before--the harsh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seamed features of the burly Earthman</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the pit. And beyond him, the slim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian girl. All motionless, standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">like statues beside him . . . beside him!</seg><seg type="columnLine">For Stuart was one of them now. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the pit, with the other captives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sensation came back slowly. With it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a tingling, a warm vibration along</seg><seg type="columnLine">his spine . . . about his throat . . . inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brain. He could not move, but at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of his range of vision flamed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimsonness--the cloak. He still wore it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wondered if the other captives could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see him, if their minds were as active as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his in their congealed bodies. Or whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chill of deathlike silence held their</seg><seg type="columnLine">brains along with their frozen limbs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHAT HATH ME?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A slow, volcanic fury began to glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">within him. Kari--traitor and murderess!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was she Aesir? Was she Earth-born?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And that black-cloaked, cowled creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">.. . which was not real. Another projector</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Aesir, as the giants had been ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You were sent by the Protectors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Memory of Kari's phrase came back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stuart now. And with it, as though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had somehow unbarred a locked gate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened it a mere crack, came a--a whisper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not audible. Faint, faraway, like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of a wind rustling ghosts of autumn</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves, the murmur rose and fell . . . call-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scarlet cloak moved . . . writhed . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowed more closely about him. Fainter</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew the voices.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stuart strained after them. His soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang up . . ■ . reaching toward those</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly, utterly inhuman whispers that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from nowhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A dull lethargy numbed him. The cloak</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew tighter. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ignored it. Deep in the citadel of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, he made himself receptive, all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">being focused on that--that strange call-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, suddenly, there were words. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Derek Stuart. Can you hear us?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Answer!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His stiff lips could not speak, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts formed an answer. And, rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">and falling as though the frequency of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible telepathy pulsed and changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">continually, the message came--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have lost. You have lost too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stuart. But we will stay with you--we</seg><seg type="columnLine">must stay now--and perhaps your death</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be easier because of that. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you ?" he thought, oddly</seg><seg type="columnLine">awed by the personality he sensed behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">that voice that was really two voices.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is little time." The--sound?--</seg><seg type="columnLine">faded into a thin whisper, then grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger. "The cloak makes it hard for us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to communicate with you. And now we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can give you none of our power at all. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a monstrous thing--a blasphemy such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the Aesir would create. Half-alive--</seg><seg type="columnLine">it makes an artificial synapse between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual and outside mental contacts. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot help you--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are the Protectors.

We removed some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your memories, so the Aesir could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">read your mind and have time to prepare</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves--we hoped we might destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">them this time. But--we have failed again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now--we give you your memories back."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like a slowly rising tide, Stuart's past</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to return. He did not question how</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was done; he was too busy lifting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">veil that had darkened his mind since--</seg><seg type="columnLine">since that night at the Singing Star in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New Boston. A few drinks with the tired-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed man, and then darkness--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the curtain was lifting now. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE remembered a tiny, underground</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, with armed men--not many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them--staring at him. A voice that</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "You must either join us or die. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare run no risks.

It was like tearing off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own skin. Sick, blind, gasping dry-throated</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobs, Stuart stumbled away from the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">alcove, tearing at the cloak. It tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cling to him--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ripped it away--hurled it from him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as it fell--it screamed!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he was free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an instant sheer weakness over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelmed him. Then into him poured a</seg><seg type="columnLine">racing, jubilant torrent of strength, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty, intoxicating power that seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">heal his wounds and revivify him in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Into him surged the power of the Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tectors !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the alcove a finger of darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendrilled out. He was borne away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">it . . . along the passage. Dimly, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifting mists, he sensed that he was mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up a ramp . . . through a wall that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to grow intangible as he approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">it . . up and up . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was in the hall of the Aesir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above him the cyclopean pillers tow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered, dwarfing the thrones set between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.

Facing him</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the cloaked, cowled figure he had last</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen with Kari.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And beside the Aesir stood Kari!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The creature lifted its arm ... a red</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame spouted toward Stuart. Sudden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mocking laughter spilled from his lips. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer fought alone. The tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of the Protectors blazed within him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">power and energy and force that could</seg><seg type="columnLine">smash suns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In midair the fiery lance failed and died.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Aesir drew back a step, drawing its</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloak about it as if in surprise. And Kari</seg><seg type="columnLine">--Kari shrank back, too, and something</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely like hope flashed for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">across her dazzling, her more than mortal</seg><seg type="columnLine">loveliness. Hope ? But she was of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aesir now. And if they failed, she died.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then why--■</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Aesir's cloak flickered, and a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">gush of fiery light fountained toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stuart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up surged the tide of power in him</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Blind and dazed with his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous energy, Stuart felt a curve like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dim shield flung up to meet that lance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Aesir's fire struck--and flashed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing fragments on the Protector's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shield. Each droplet sang intolerable music</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it faded and winked out. And be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the Aesir, more dazzling than any</seg><seg type="columnLine">immortal fire had been, Stuart saw Kari's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden, shining smile. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She would die if the Aesir failed. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">must know she would die. But the bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liance of her smile struck him as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aesir's spear of fire could never strike.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew, then. He understood. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Aesir's cloak whirled like a storm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud, in dark, deep billows. The Aesir</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself grew taller for a moment, as if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew itself up to a godlike height. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then it did for Derek Stuart what no</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aesir had ever done for a mortal man</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. No Aesir had ever needed to. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast off the hampering cloak and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripped for battle with this primitive man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling whose forebears immemorially long ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been the Aesir's forebears. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that stripping something almost of kin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship--an acknowledgment that here at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hall of the Aesir stood an equal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprung of equal stock. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Naked in its terrible power, the Aesir</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood up to face the man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not human. Not ever human, except in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mysterious basics which these people</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a thousand millenniums in the future</seg><seg type="columnLine">had chosen to retain. The flesh they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast off, and the flesh the Aesir stood up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in to face his forebear was pure, blazing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinding energy. Twice as tall as a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">it stood, shining with supernal brilliance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible and magnificent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great hall rang soundlessly with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of the Protectors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then from above a streak of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">came flashing, and another, and another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And were engulfed in the one Aesir who</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood shining before its adversary, growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever brighter and more terrible. The rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Aesir, coming to the aid of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow, forming a single entity to crush</seg><seg type="columnLine">the champion of mankind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stuart braced himself for the incredible</seg><seg type="columnLine">68	- PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">torrent of energy that would come blasting</seg><seg type="columnLine">through him from the Protectors. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a split second--it came!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mind and body reeled beneath the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pact of that power as force flared through</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and struck out at the tower of light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning which was the Aesir. But the force</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was trying his human body to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">utmost was not force enough to touch that</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinding column. Energy lashed out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, struck him a reeling blow-- Stuart</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped to his knees, the hall swimming in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire around him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what he saw was not the terrible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing image of his adversary, but Kari's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face beyond. His falling meant her life</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but when she saw him go down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliance dimmed upon her features. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope he had seen there went out like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">candle-flame and she was once more only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vessel of human flesh which the Aesir</seg><seg type="columnLine">had possessed and degraded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In his despair and his dizziness he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried soundlessly, "Help me, Protectors!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Give me your power!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The still double-voice said, "You could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hold it. You would be burned out</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll hold it long enough!" he promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">death--but not till then !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was one instant when time</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped. That cataclysmic horror that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">risen a thousand years ago and raged</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the worlds like a holocaust stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing before Stuart's eyes. It stooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him, poising for the hammer blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would smash him to nothing--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN a power like the drive of</seg><seg type="columnLine">galaxies through space thundered into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stuart's mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had not expected this. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in human experience could have taught</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to expect it. For the Protectors</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not human. No more human than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aesir themselves. lAnd the unleashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy that roared ^'soundlessly through</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stuart rocked his very soul on its founda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. He could not stir. He could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">think. He could only stay upon his knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing the Aesir-thing as galactic power</seg><seg type="columnLine">thundered through him and wielded him</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a sword against man's enemies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Higher and higher rose the crashing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tides of contest. The citadel shook pon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derously upon the rocks of the god-made</seg><seg type="columnLine">little world.

Faster raced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tides of power through Stuart's blasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, seeming to rip his very flesh apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blaze in his brain like hammers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cosmic fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Terribly, terribly he yearned for sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cease, for the end of this unthinkable de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction that was tearing his brain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">body apart. And he knew he could end</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in a moment, if he chose to let go. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grimly he clung to the power that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroying him. Second by second, count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing each moment an eternity, he clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">to consciousness. The crashing lances of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Protectors drove on upon the armor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Aesir, and the cyclopean pillars</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great hall reeled upon their founda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, and the very air blazed into liquid</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire around him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He never knew what final blow of cos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mic violence ended that battle. But sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, without warning, the vast column</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Aesir pulsed with violent brilliance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the whole hall rang with a cry too</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrill and terrible for ears or the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind to hear, except as a thrilling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">despair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tower rocked.

The Hemi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheric Congress had set up the Mutant</seg><seg type="columnLine">College two hundred years ago, and every</seg><seg type="columnLine">child with I.Q. above 200 and physique</seg><seg type="columnLine">to match, became a member, for the sole</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose of selecting a President whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">primary duty would be to fight a war, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it should come in his term, on one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant keyboards. This had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">concession to left-wing agitation that, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was to be another war, it should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be fought by the leaders and not by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mutant College had been established</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the Hunyas had overrun Europe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Asia, and now for two centuries there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been no war, but only preparation for</seg><seg type="columnLine">war, East against West, through systems</seg><seg type="columnLine">of selection and training closely parallel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but with a difference that was forever in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hoshawk's mind--if he was a capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, the Hunyas kept him for twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one 3'ears. And obviously you could de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pend a lot more on a man of thirty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">than you could on a boy sixteen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Forgacs, president of the Hunyas, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty-three--an old man for a mutant, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smart and clever as only a mutant could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be at that age.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yesterday the Hunyas had challenged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was sudden, but not unexpected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no reason for delay.

Hoshawk asked quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," Jeffrey watched the forty states-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men file out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sire," said Hoshawk, and his manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">was respectful, for this boy of sixteen was</seg><seg type="columnLine">his commander-in-chief, "I still wish we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had trained a few thousand men in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">use of weapons. I don't see how we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight a war with electronic tubes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jeffrey looked at him gravely.

Hoshawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not quite identify it, and yet he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it spoke of the inner wisdom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">conviction of the young.

By the act of reverting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the use of human fighters, we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">convince the world that war could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought electronically."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They reached the door of the Chamber.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The President shook hands with Iraola</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with Hoshawk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wish me luck," he said lightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They inclined their heads, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they looked up, the President was seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a beryllium stool that traveled a three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter circle before the great bank of keys</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the keyboard of a giant organ.

Hoshawk wondered if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valve was leaking, and frowned. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chamber had been tested exhaustively,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but with hundrds of thousands of circuits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut-backs, by-passes, and relays, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible the oxygen valve had been over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JEFFREY ^trapped himself into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair.

At first they ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploded in air as they hit the screen, but as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the explosive force of the DTN began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drain the screen, those behind began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pour through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was a flash from Philadelphia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a shock went through Hoshawk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something was wrong there. Jeffrey</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't intended that. Forgacs had used</seg><seg type="columnLine">atom bombs and had broken through when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screen was down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jeffrey's fingers snatched at the oxygen</seg><seg type="columnLine">valve. He tore it off and threw it'on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. He still held one important ad van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ELECTRON EAT ELECTRON	75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tage. He was ahead of Forgacs by forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Philadelphia went out and the golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">defensive screen began to fade, but Jef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">frey, tensely erect, stayed on the attack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hundreds of green lights began to rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Marseilles -- great submarines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlled by electronics and carrying tanks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and guns and explosives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The green lights converged on Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seilles. They got through the screen. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the big gamble. Jeffrey guessed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forgacs would operate from an under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground chamber near Marseilles itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wasn't a logical thing to do, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forgacs would do it, believing that Jef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">frey would pass Marseilles and go inland</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find the Chamber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jeffrey let him believe that. He sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight thousand giant electron-controlled</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombers through the Marseilles gap and</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight for Berlin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The green lights started winking on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast of France, showing the submarines</seg><seg type="columnLine">were unloading amphibious tanks. Jef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">frey started them out across France at high</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. Near Paris they met heavy resis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance from Forgacs' tank-killers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now Jeffrey had more trouble.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forgacs had slipped a salvo of atom bombs</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the Labrador power station, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire north quadrant of Jeffrey's screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">was down. And just at that instant, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic breaker failed and a tube burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in the Montevideo power station, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the southern half of South America was</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposed. Green lights began to wink up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the open spaces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JEFFREY was grim. It was near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end. Dog eat dog. His flying fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">chose to ignore Forgacs' attack, beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">firing millions of salvos of small rockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were little better than a delaying</seg><seg type="columnLine">action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were only two targets in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">war--the Chambers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jeffrey released his trump--thirty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred flying robot tanks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They rocketed through the Marseilles</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen and came on the city from the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, firing eight-inch rockets and shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames out half a mile ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this was a feint, too. From the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">now rose a great armada of robot subma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rine carriers that spewed out tanks that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were little more than armored tank-cars</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with jellied XPR, which exploded</seg><seg type="columnLine">always down, toward the center of gravita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. They poured out the jelly on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface around Marseilles for a distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of twenty miles until according to Jef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">frey's figures the ground was covered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot thick. The flame-throwers roared</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it and Jeffrey stopped them there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he fired his last salvo of atom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombs from the Bahamas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime, Forgacs' tanks had</seg><seg type="columnLine">overrun Boston, searching for the Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can Chamber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lights began to wink out, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hoshawk knew that Boston was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Orange lights, indicating bombers, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">heading for Chicago, and Hoshawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that if Jeffrey's guess on Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seilles was bad, he had not much longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to live.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at the Map. The atom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombs were at Marseilles. A glow showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the twenty-mile circle that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with jelly, and Hoshawk knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atom-bombs had landed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew that on the other continent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most tremendous explosion in man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">history was taking place. And when it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">over there would be a mile-deep crater</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Marseilles had been, and anything,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no matter how deep it was buried, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be destroyed by concussion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Jeffrey still played the keys, but his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on the orange lights approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They reached Chicago, perhaps directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">over their heads, but Hoshawk felt no</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombs. A moment later the planes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still going westward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jeffrey called the Starter. "Does For-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gacs concede?" he askec*.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a moment's delay, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Forgacs does not answer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The President let out an undignified</seg><seg type="columnLine">whoop.

"We won!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Hemispheric diplomats were gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering excitedly in the corridor.

'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had felt it before they did--a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant blast.

The floor shud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered under their feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came again, and again, farther away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A pattern. Then off somewhere else came</seg><seg type="columnLine">another string of explosions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The forty august heads stared at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling.

"For-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gacs' Chamber was destroyed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The President was already back in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chamber.

You have won</seg><seg type="columnLine">the war."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hoshawk was behind him. "But he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">still firing, isn't he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No." The President was icily alert.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He pointed to the big map.

"The Chamber is gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Undeniably gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A new pattern of bomb-bursts came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from above. "Chicago must be destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by now," said the President harshly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to a blacked-out area on the ground-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass screen above. "There are no detector</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes left above us. But look--orange</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights. Thousands of them coming from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea on the Maryland coast. And look</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, to the right. One--two--fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand bombers coming!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hoshawk nodded as if he had known it</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the time.

And Forgacs</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself is here, leading them. We're</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped, Sire! Where is your civilization</seg><seg type="columnLine">now ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wadsworth was calm. He was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">taking it like a man, anyway. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw a lever and poised at the great key-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board, then his mutant fingers began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work in blurred movement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hoshawk watched the screen above. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantic filled with long trains of red lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">that arose from their American bases and</seg><seg type="columnLine">streamed eastward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hoshawk blinked. "You're firing every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. And you've locked the controls."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wadsworth didn't look up. "In five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes," he said, "there won't be an ounce</seg><seg type="columnLine">of explosive left in any emplacement in</seg><seg type="columnLine">America."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But that's--" Hoshawk started to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">"foolish," but he changed it.

Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden explosive screen showed no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Map. Already some of the em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placements had ceased to spew out red</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights, and the tail-ends of their trains were</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappearing to the east.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hoshawk shuddered as he saw that now</seg><seg type="columnLine">America was completely defenseless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But Wadsworth spoke into his trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitter. "Radio. Give me special fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quency three-hundred-eighty-one thousand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">six hundred kilocycles.

You see General,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we ourselves haven't trusted Forgacs."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hoshawk's grim face lighted up. "Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you mean you have secretly made some</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting equipment?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wadsworth shook his head. "NoV We</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have.

The nation was almost covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a canopy of orange lights marked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">black crosses. "There must be at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">a million bombers over us!

"Stalled," Hoshawk thought sar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">donically. It took something besides smart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness to win a war. It took character, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Wadsworth pointed to the American</seg><seg type="columnLine">shores. Long lines of green and white</seg><seg type="columnLine">and black and yellow dots coming from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea, crawling in among the orange</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights that swarmed over America like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic swarm of hornets. "Submarines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">amphibian battleships, flame-throwers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanks," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hoshawk stood erect. "If it were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">against regulations, Sire, I would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted to blow my head off.

As a people--no, I don't think so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As a civilization, I hope, we can be saved."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hoshawk's eyes narrowed. "How?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those purple lights represent sonic</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmitters. In other words, generating</seg><seg type="columnLine">stations for sound frequencies above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow band which can be heard by hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mans.

Would the captain never call a halt?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hell, they couldn't march straight through</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the mine without rest.

These were the "Barber's De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights," an odd life-form of Titan that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed a sort of aloof friendship with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Patrol from the moment it landed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">men jokingly called them Barber's Delights</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of the thick, shaggy coat of hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">that covered their log-like bodies. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">B.D.'s either didn't understand, or just</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't care, for they made no objection to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their nickname.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were twenty of the creatures in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this group, and more joined them along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way. They imitated the brisk step</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the soldiers with amazing exactness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they possessed no semblance what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soever of feet. They moved on dense mats</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stubby, resilient bristles that grew from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the flat bottoms of their column-bodies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeping forward like a horde of self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">propelling brooms. Not wishing to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">outdone by the visitors, they had their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">sergeant, who moved along importantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the side of his command, glaring threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eningly from the corner of his single, huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye. As Sergeant Hallihan called out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">impeccable, "Hut! Twuh, hree, foar,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sergeant B.

Hallihan scowled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his shoulder and snorted disgruntledly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fervently wishing he could get his heckler</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone for a moment. His hard cot would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a new fur mattress that night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hallihan estimated they were half-way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the mine now. That huge deposit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chroidex salts was important to the system.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without the precious mineral space-flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be impossible, since there would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be nothing to protect travelers from deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">solar rays.

He went through the formality of</seg><seg type="columnLine">placing his men at ease, then strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously to the captain's side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you suppose there will be trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Squeakers, Sir?" he asked appre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hensively.

One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the creatures got his top blown off when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he let it stick out too far from behind a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock, but he immediately grew a new one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The I.P. men weren't faring so well.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Most of the Squeakers' shots went wild,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the very intensity of their fire took its</seg><seg type="columnLine">toll of the outnumbered patrolmen. Halli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">han rushed about from rock to rock, pat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting his soldiers on the back and shouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">words of encouragement in their ears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The B.D. sergeant hurried along behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, whacking his tentacle across the furry</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies of his compatriots and keeping up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a steady flow of loud, well-pleased "Unghs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Staley was doing his sharfi of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fighting. He crouched behind a round</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulder, snapping quick shots at the gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rison and drawing back before the Squeak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers could locate him. Sergeant Hallihan</seg><seg type="columnLine">CRISIS ON TITAN	83</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flopped down beside him and lay staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioningly at his superior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can't win," Staley said, matter-of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">factly. "The garrison was built to with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand just such a siege as this. We have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hit those loopholes in the wall dead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">center to bring down a Squeaker. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't have nailed more than half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so; half a dozen, out of a thousand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Attack from the rear is impossible, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of the steep canyon walls protecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the garrison on three sides. If we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">rout them into the open, we could blast</seg><seg type="columnLine">them down like cattle. There would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">no escape, except through our ranks, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">our sharpshooters would take care of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">who broke through. But that's just wishful</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking, Sergeant. The Squeakers aren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupid enough to try charging us. They'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay holed up in the garrison, picking us</seg><seg type="columnLine">off one by one. There's no place to run to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All of our food and water is in the hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those devils, so we have our choice of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting it out to the last man or retreat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the mine and wait for thirst and</seg><seg type="columnLine">starvation to end our worries. What will</seg><seg type="columnLine">it be, Sergeant?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll fight, Sir," Hallihan said grimly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yclhoo! Pour it to 'em, men ! Give 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">a taste of I.P. hell!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above the noise of battle could be heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rat-like screeching of the Squeakers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The B.D.s answered with their version of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Bronx cheer, and between them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground-shaking c-r-rump-c-r-rump of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atomic cannons, the uproar was enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cause a nervous breakdown in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">staunchest habitue of Times Square.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NIGHT fell across the scene, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle raged on. The I.P. patrol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men now had a slight advantage, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">large bulk of the garrison was easily dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cernible in the dim light and they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the locations of the loopholes well-fixed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their minds. After each shot, they shifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">positions, crawling over the ground so the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Squeakers could not observe their move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments. More than one unlucky fellow was</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out, though, when a tall B.D. fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed him, hurling challenges at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Squeakers in a loud, attention-drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. This hindrance was temporarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">done away with when midnight came and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully half of the B.D.s spouted blue smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their shaggy tops and dwindled away</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to silent, waxy seeds. More of them lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">their enthusiasm for the battle as their</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown fur slowly took on a yellowish hue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they retired to various dark crannies</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sulk away their last few living moments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have an idea, Sir," Hallihan reported</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitedly to Captain Staley. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">armored grav-car of yours could easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">gain the wall of the garrison without get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting knocked out of commission, couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">it? Well, here's the plan. We use the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shovel handles to whip together a ladder</seg><seg type="columnLine">long enough to scale the wall. Then me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a couple of the men speed through to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the garrison in the grav-car and prop the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladder against the wall before the Squeak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers can nail us. Maybe one or two of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">will live long enough to get over the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and open the gates. Then before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Squeakers catch wise, the rest of you</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge through the gates and finish 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">off. What do you think, Sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must commend you for your valor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sergeant," Staley said soberly. "But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't believe your plan would work. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">assuming that one of you would get through</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the gates--and you must admit there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be small chance of that--the Squeak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers would still be in possession of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannons, and our men would be easy tar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets at such close range. We would only</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring about our own defeat that much</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner. However, you have given me an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Staley's arms snapped bach</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a baseball pitcher's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">84</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">idea, Sergeant. As you say, the grav-car</seg><seg type="columnLine">could gain the garrison wall, and a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">could stand outside with reasonable safety</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he was careful not to move in line with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a loophole. What is the time, Sergeant?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, er, five minutes past twelve, Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">--Titan-time." ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good," Staley said determinedly. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must put my plan into immediate opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. In ten minutes, Sergeant, my car</seg><seg type="columnLine">will move toward the garrison. Instruct</seg><seg type="columnLine">your men to direct a heavy fire at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loopholes until I have reached the wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The more confusion, the better; anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">that will draw the Squeakers' attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from me. After that, well-- Inform</seg><seg type="columnLine">your men of the plan, Sergeant!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hallihan gulped and saluted. "Yes, Sir!</seg><seg type="columnLine">That I'll do, Sir!" Cripes!- Had the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man lost his marbles? One man against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand Squeakers! That was crazier</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Hallihan's own idea! Nevertheless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sergeant raced away to lay down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">law to the sleepy-eyed soldiers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten minutes later, Captain Staley's grav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">car leaped from behind a boulder and bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">down swiftly on the dark garrison. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly the patrolmen began howling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasting at the garrison, drawing a mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derous return fire from the mildly-sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised Squeakers. The few B.D.s who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were still capable of its added their voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the din, and Staley's car lurched to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">halt at the garrison wall, completely un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">damaged. The Captain jumped out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumbled inside the car a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What the hell was he doing, Hallihan</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered. He watched the dark form</seg><seg type="columnLine">move cautiously along the rampart and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop at a point where a good-sized up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaval in the ground raised him to within</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten feet of the wall's top. The captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">went through some strange motions. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand dug in his pocket and then his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped back like a baseball pitcher's. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand flicked forward and came down to dig</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more in his pocket. Again he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the movements of throwing some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. Hallihan scratched his head puz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zledly, straining his eyes to see what Staley</seg><seg type="columnLine">did next. That was all. Staley returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his car and climbed inside, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedy little vehicle gave no indication of</seg><seg type="columnLine">withdrawing from its position against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">garrison wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Things quieted down a bit then, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hallihan nearly went mad waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to happen. Now and then an</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic cannon blasted out at the patrol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, but the intensity of the Squeakers'</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire had diminished considerably from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of earlier in the battle. They had plenty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. They would wait until morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the sun exposed the hiding places of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the I.P. men, then it would be curtains</seg><seg type="columnLine">for these hated invaders from another</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. Hallihan wished he could sleep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he knew if he did he might never</seg><seg type="columnLine">wake up again. He waited. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A minute later, the sergeant's hair al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most stood on end as a prolonged, hide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous screech of terror beat against his ears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing, swelling in intensity, and owning</seg><seg type="columnLine">a note of stark, unreasoning fear. It came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the garrison; came from the throats</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a thousand panicked Squeakers. Hal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lihan's jaw gaped ludicrously as the gates</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst open and hundreds of screaming,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrabbling, sleek-boiled Squeakers spilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the clearing, fleeing from the garrison</seg><seg type="columnLine">as fast as their skinny legs could carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Hallihan recovered quickly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his surprise and drew a bead on the lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Squeaker. The creature crumpled un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the heat-beam, shrieking in agony as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fellows trampled over him, making</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulp of his thrashing, charred body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give 'em hell, boys!" Hallihan shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">exultantly. "Pour it to the rats!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The I.P. patrolmen needed no coaxing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The terrified Squeakers were already fall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing by the dozens under their withering</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. The rodent-like animals hesitated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not knowing where to turn. Some of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran to the canyon walls and tried to scrab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble up to safety, but the sharp-eyed sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diers nailed them before they could go a</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard. An atomic cannon started banging</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the garrison, and Hallihan knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Staley had plunged his grav-car</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the open gates and taken over one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the deadly guns. After that, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a question of mopping up. .. . M</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN morning came, the canyon</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor looked like an inverted grave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard. Blackened, torn bodies, all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained of the Squeakers, littered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing. Weary patrolmen emerged from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the protecting boulders, moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">warily, lest some of the creatures were</seg><seg type="columnLine">MAKING</seg><seg type="columnLine">YOUR WISHES</seg><seg type="columnLine">COME TRUE...</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">One wish has been fulfilled.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped back, clapped his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO naked Blue Dawn Men appeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauled forth the cage, shouldered it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With Bemmelman following, they bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">it across the court, into a doorway at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base of the lichen covered tower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I feel perfectly ridiculous," whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mia, bouncing around in the cage.

The room</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be a guard room.

Then it</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Force screen," he guessed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bemmelman approached, grinning ami-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably.

I'm going to be able to use you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That's what you said last night," Cosmo</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminded him, his face blank. The palms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his hands were sweating. He wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run as fast and far from the sly, red</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced man as he could. Bemmelman, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beginning to sense, was as slippery</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dangerous as the infamous Venusian</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamp rath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A door at the rear of the chamber opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly. Cosmo jumped. A glance as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sured him it was only a slave girl. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't a Venusian, though. He frowned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was from Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Terran girl regarded the prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously, then faced Bemmelman. "Rabaul</seg><seg type="columnLine">6aid you wanted me." She was dressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a green sarong which reached from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her knees to her breasts. On her left</seg><seg type="columnLine">104</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder was a small scar in the shape of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fern leaf: Bemmelman's brand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes sir," said the planter; "so I do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So I do, Liana. Be so good as to escort</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Maclver to the tower apartment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't leave her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mia shuddered, clung tighter to Cosmo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Keep your head, Mia."

She was so woe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">begone that Cosmo felt a wrench at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. He faced the planter, said in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard voice, "What did you want with me ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bemmelman's eyelids drooped. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned on his heel, said shortly, "Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, Cosmo," and started for the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I want to have a talk with you. Yes sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very interesting talk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FLANKED by the two blue giants</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo followed his host down a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor, up a flight of steps and into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumptuously furnished apartment. A yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low grass mat carpeted the floor from wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wall. The furniture was covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a coarse, woven fabric, barbaric in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">color.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a sigh, Bemmelman lowered him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self into a lounge chair, indicated another</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Cosmo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're tired. You've had an uncom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable journey. I won't keep you up</seg><seg type="columnLine">long." He rang a bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With amazing promptness, a wizened</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mercurian scurried through a sliding wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">panel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Krudo juice," said Bemmelman; "cold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And sandwiches.

They gave onto a Venusian</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden of grotesque beauty, each plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shrub sparkling with a cold phosphores-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cence. Several insects, the huge, bird-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects of Venus, winged in from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden. As they reached the window,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a sudden sparkle of flame. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects dropped dead to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An excellent warning," Bemmelman</seg><seg type="columnLine">said in a silky voice.

"Ingenious</seg><seg type="columnLine">gadget."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gadget?" The red faced planter</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw back his head, laughed uproariously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're a droll rogue, you are. I like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with a sense of humor." He rubbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nose, then pointed to a picture above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sofa. "Recognize her, don't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo saw a three dimensional photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graph of a nude.

"The .</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blue Venus.

So I do. But its possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to harvest a yearly crop from a forest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trees grow even slower than people. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">show you the slave pens tomorrow. I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the one Blue Venus, though. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunately the rest have been males."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo wondered why the planter had</seg><seg type="columnLine">called attention to the Blue Venus.

He paused as the Mercurian re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned, deposited a tray between them. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">held a silver pitcher of krudo juice, thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandwiches, a bottle of food concentrates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go ahead," said Cosmo when the Mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curian had departed.

I could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">had you assassinated several times, but~</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've some information I want?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BLUE VENVS	105</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo's green eyes narrowed warily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What information?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The planter leaned forward, tapped him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the knee. "That bird. The Giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ormoo. Oh yes, I know how you escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the roof last night. Yes sir, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">very neat, too." He beamed amiably. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to know where the Ormoos feed."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo sat back in surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's my secret," said the beefy</seg><seg type="columnLine">planter. "Yes sir, that's my secret. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm a business man, Cosmo. Show me</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the Ormoo feeds, and I'll make it</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth your while."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Five thousand monad," Cosmo haz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bemmelman didn't blink an eye. "Five</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand monad," he agreed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">COSMO sat back, his face blank. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">planter, he realized, had no more idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of paying him five thousand monad than</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had of adopting him. He'd agreed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the preposterous sum too readily. Cosmo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">green eyes hardened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And suppose I refuse."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you won't.

Cosmo could</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel sweat starting from his forehead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That bird's savage as a tiger. You've</seg><seg type="columnLine">already tried to trace it to its feeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, haven't you? That's why you</seg><seg type="columnLine">planted a spy among my men, wasn't it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">" "Yes sir," Bemmelman admitted with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sigh. "I don't mind telling you he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed to find out what and where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird ate. But it damn near tore him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo didn't say anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bemmelman leaned forward, tapped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knee again. "Unfortunately, the birds are</seg><seg type="columnLine">rare as the dodo. I've spent quite a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of money trying to locate another. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one that's been caught is in the Solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apiary on Earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mention of the Ormoo in the Solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apiary stirred Cosmo's memory. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at Bemmelman with narrowed eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Ormoo in its wild state matured to</seg><seg type="columnLine">its full size in a few months. The one</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the Terran expedition had secured,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't reached adulthood until its nine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teenth year. The discrepancy had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzling ornthologists ever since. Theories</seg><seg type="columnLine">had flooded the scientific journals, but to</seg><seg type="columnLine">date, no one had explained satisfactorily</seg><seg type="columnLine">why a wild Ormoo should mature over</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty times as fast as the same bird in</seg><seg type="columnLine">captivity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" Bemmelman rubbed his nose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyelids drooping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I show you where the Ormoo feeds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what guarantee have I that you'll carry out</seg><seg type="columnLine">your side of the bargain?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just my word," said Bemmelman with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chuckle. "Just my word."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two rouge-like spots sprang out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo's cheek bones. He came halfway</seg><seg type="columnLine">erect in his chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No violence, please." The planter held</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his hand. "Look behind you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo turned his head. The two Jovian</seg><seg type="columnLine">primitives were crouched to spring. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank back in his chair, managed a tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">grin. His lips felt dry, his stomach hollow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't think you appreciate your posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, Cosmo," said the planter silkily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No sir, I don't." He heaved himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his chair with a grunt. "I've some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to show you. Come with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two Jovian Dawn Men fell in be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side Cosmo again as he trailed the planter</seg><seg type="columnLine">down three steps, along a short corridor</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a sunken court. Bemmelman paused,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to a huge wooden cross in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the court.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You weren't depending on him, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">you," he smirked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo felt his blood run cold.. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">fists clenched until the nails bit into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The body of Penang-ihtok hung from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cross. The outcast Fozoql had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">crucified upside down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see," said Bemmelman, his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy with assurance; "how futile it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">to oppose me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo turned away from the cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its grisly burden. He looked coldly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">speculatively at Bemmelman's beefy smil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing face. At the look, fright glimmered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planter's eyes. He made a quick ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture to the Jovians who seized Cosmo by</seg><seg type="columnLine">either arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take him away," he ordered. "We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk it over tomorrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo was conducted into a plainly, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortably furnished room. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue giants immediately stretched himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">106</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the sofa and went to sleep. The other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, took a stance by the door, folded</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms, regarded Cosmo with the unwink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing stare of an idol. Obviously, the Jovian</seg><seg type="columnLine">primitives intended to spell each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a grunt of annoyance, Cosmo re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated into the bathroom. He had grossly</seg><seg type="columnLine">underestimated Bemmelman, he realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">with chagrin. A malignant genius, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave breeder had no more scruples than</seg><seg type="columnLine">his Dawn Men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo heard a soft step behind him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled around. His Jovian guard was</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing placidly just within tbe door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damn," he snapped, nerves jangling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm not going to crawl out the drain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blue giant never changed expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">by so much as a flicker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo got a grip on himself, shot the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant his flashing grin. "What's the mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter? Cat got your tongue?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stripped off coat and trousers, hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">them carefully over the Jovian's shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped under the shower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Considerably refreshed, he returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sleeping chamber, crawled raw into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the huge bed. But sleep escaped him. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">stark cross, the body illuminated by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiations of the lichens and mosses, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted in thrusting itself before his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He clenched his fists, trembled in an agony</seg><seg type="columnLine">of impotent fury. Somehow, he'd trip up</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bemmelman, smash his disgusting racket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">COSMO awakened in the huge bed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweating with terror. The echo of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some nameless horror still rang in his ears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw the Dawn Man, motionless as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">statue, watching him with animal patience.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he heard it again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a girl's scream. It reached him</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly. It went on and on. He leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of bed, tugged on his trousers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Dawn Man sprang across the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">to intercept him. Cosmo seized a metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, swung it with the same movement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It caught the blue giant on his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders. The blow would have felled</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ox. The Jovian folded onto the carpet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay still. Cosmo thought he must be dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second Jovian primitive jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the sofa at the crash. He had awak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened like an animal. With a low snarl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he leaped for Cosmo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo ducked under his first rush,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed the chair down on the back of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">head. The giant staggered groggily, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't go down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo measured the distance, walloped</seg><seg type="columnLine">him again. The second blue giant went</seg><seg type="columnLine">over like a falling tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without stopping for coat or shoes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo hurtled into the hall. The scream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing had been silenced. The building was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet as a deserted church.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He set out at a lope in the direction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tower where Mia was confined. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been Mia screaming, he was sure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'd recognized the timbre of her voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His heart thudding, he reached a stair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the steps two at a time. It bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply to the left, went up another flight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He must be in the tower itself. The silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">was oppressive. He wished fervently he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a dart gun, a ray projector, anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would serve as a weapon. The steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to wind upward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gasping for breath, he reached the fifth</seg><seg type="columnLine">level. From beneath a door seeped a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack of light. He sniffed. A peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">odor impinged on his nostrils. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Bemmelman's rough voice like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rasp of iron.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's done.

He tried to scramble to his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Cosmo was on him like a cat on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouse.

A blinding rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook him to the marrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As if from a distance, he heard Mia</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cosmo!

He saw Liana,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Terran slave girl, directly behind him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her arm was upraised, her fist clutching</seg><seg type="columnLine">a needle like dagger. With a sob, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BLUE VENUS	107</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged it downward toward his heaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo caught her wrist in a grip of iron,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore the dagger from her fingers.

He paused suddenly, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes dilating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">There was an angry red scar above Mia's</seg><seg type="columnLine">left breast. He realized what the smell</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the landing outside the tower room had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been.

"Well sir, I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been curious about how much longer it</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes for an Ormoo in captivity to mature</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the wild bird.

He paused again, mouth open, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily went on: "Yes sir. I wondered if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it wasn't the wild birds' diet.

His lids</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew down. "I injected it into one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave children in minute doses every</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty days.

"Unfor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunately," he went on hurriedly, "I used</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">up all the drug on the experiment, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I haven't been able to locate any more</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the plants. No sir, we've scoured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cloud Mountains. They're difficult to</seg><seg type="columnLine">explore.

He said: "You don't give me</seg><seg type="columnLine">much choice," and twisted to his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He hobbled to the desk, dropped awk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wardly into the chair.

Deny this, and you deny</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Theory. Considering the success of the recent atomic research</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">based upon Einstein's formulae, and considering Einstein's suc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cess in prognosticating an "error" in Mercury's revolution about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Sun, one would be rash to deny the Theory or the light-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">velocity limit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The second fact is that according to all the laws of physics</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">(which have never been denied by Einstein) a given number of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">footpounds applied to a given mass over a given period of time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will produce a calculable acceleration in the direction of applica-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion. Therefore an object with the power to accelerate at low</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">speeds will likewise be able to accelerate at speeds nearing or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">equaling the speed of light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  How then to conciliate these apparently contradictory facts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Here the basic premises of Relativity comes to the rescue. Is it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">possible for an object to be traveling at a speed of light or faster</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">according to the space-time frame standard from which it started,</seg><seg type="columnLine">VIZIGRAPH	119</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet seem to be traveling at a speed lower than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speed of light by every possible physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of determining speed. To the object it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, the space-time variance resulting from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">variance in velocity will be just enough to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the object's speed, as measured by the Mickelson-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morley method, a naught. Also due to the space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time frame differences, an observer at any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">place or time would calculate a speed less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of light</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Therefore if an object accelerated at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand miles per second per day for a year, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the year it would be going three hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred sixty-five miles per second, which on a graph</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a straight line rising above the speed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. But to an observer on let us say Earth, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed would approach the speed of light at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slower and slower light. If the first line ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached infinite speed; the second would reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light speed. Meanwhile the object's own</seg><seg type="columnLine">measurable speed would remain at zero.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  To illustrate this a little more, if an object ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">celerated at three times the pull of gravity for</seg><seg type="columnLine">four years, decelerated for four years, turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">around, accelerated for another four years, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally decelerated four years, sixteen years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have passed on Earth. But because of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact the object's average speed would be so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater than the speed of light, that its time</seg><seg type="columnLine">scale would have been altered to such an extent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that only about four years and two months</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have passed for the object itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This, by the way, is of particular interest be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause it is the only way to "time travel." Also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">other than the hyperspace theories now emerg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, it is the only means of inter-stellar travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">even to our nearest neighbor in the practical span</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a lifetime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Yours,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Arthur J.

Since I</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed the issue in which they first appeared, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not know to what extent my own views will</seg><seg type="columnLine">disagree, but in view of those that appeared in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Winter issue, I feel that they will.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To put it into a few words, my claim is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the velocity of light is constant only in relation</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its source or point of reflection. This was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicated some time ago by an experiment per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed by Prof. Michelson. The experiment was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aimed at either proving or disproving the exist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of a stationary ether and the results were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken as an indication that there was no such</seg><seg type="columnLine">element. It was reasoned that if the earth were</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving through a stationary ether, an ether</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream would be set up parallel to the earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion, and that a beam of light would take</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer to travel up this stream and back than it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would across and back. In the experiment, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance the beam of light was sent was the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">in each direction and so was the time required.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now this is easily understood, if we admit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speed of light is not constant in relation to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ether. When sent up the stream, the speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was reduced by the opposite motion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">source, this change being rectified by the motion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the reflecting surface in the same direction as</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of the source. The return reversed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">process.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is my belief that momentum of material</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies is caused by the same conditions of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ether as those which produce light waves. Since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ether permeates all space and matter, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atoms of a body traveling through it act as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">depressions of waves while the more dense ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment between them act as the crests. The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference in light waves is that the depressions</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not contain the complicated structure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">atoms. It has been shown that light can travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly faster or slower than the accepted speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then why not matter? The problem may lie only</seg><seg type="columnLine">in finding a driving force that will maintain ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectiveness at such speeds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The speed of light is constant in relation to</seg><seg type="columnLine">its source. It is not constant in relation to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ether. Mr. Sherlock is wrong. Mr Sigler is</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong They are both right. Or am I wrong?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I would like to thank all parties respon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible for the great improvements in this mag in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last two years.

Surely no writer of the genre has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been so successful to date. It is not impossible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I think it will take the advent of a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">school of writers, or a new trend in science--</seg><seg type="columnLine">pseudo or real--to bring forth such works. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">type of story presently being written just doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have that element of literary worth in it. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">entertaining, naturally, or you and I wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">read it, but "literature" never.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now we come to the letter of one Lionel Inn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Firstly, sir, don't you think your own words</seg><seg type="columnLine">lend themselves rather well to another point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">veiw--"Greatness of an author's work is judged</seg><seg type="columnLine">by what the majority thinks, and not by a mi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nority like fandom."???? Well . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But to criticize further--Kipling, you say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrote mere Indian "local color," and The Jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Book is tripe, eh. Well ... I wonder how your</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion would be received by the Saturday Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of Literature--crank, they might say, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps literary moron. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You ask us, too, to consider the works of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Edgar Allen Poe. "Did he not write stf?" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not--in any appreciable quantity, and cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly not of a quality that befitted the super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural and fantasy stories upon which his fame</seg><seg type="columnLine">rests.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And then what about H. G. Wells." Surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">even you do not seriously believe that H. G.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wells' success was made by his scientific ro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mances. Not for nothing did he write The Outline</seg><seg type="columnLine">of History, Tuno-Bungay, Mr. Britling Sees It</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through, and the like. Of all his science-fiction</seg><seg type="columnLine">tales, only The Time Machine comes close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">winning an all-around fame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for G. K. Chesterton, if his name must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be brought up (and I'd really rather not at all),</seg><seg type="columnLine">do so in relationship to the medium in which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did dabble, fantasy. The same holds true for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Merritt, Lovecraft, and Shakespeare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This last seems to bring forth your main error,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Innman, drifting away from the initial</seg><seg type="columnLine">statement. Where A1 Weinstein was concerned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with science-fiction, in its relation to fine litera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, you attempted to disprove him by refer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring to the works of fantasy, not science-fiction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">authors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that is in itself an entirely different</seg><seg type="columnLine">story, for no one ever denied fantasy'its high</seg><seg type="columnLine">place in literature. Many indeed are the authors</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose fame was achieved wholly through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">VIZIGRAPH	123</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">medium of the fantasy story.

Fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most 011 the list was the excellent fantasy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rocklynne's, The Diver si]al. One of the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">tales to come out in any magazine at the present</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. The plot was not exactly new, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances, treatment and writing were par</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellence. It was fascinating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The rest of the stories I consider hack, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exception of Man-nth. It was an interesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea, but the way in which the story was exe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuted was rather amateurish. Too many loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends floating about. I've noticed that about quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot of the newer crop of stories. Since it's got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be blamed on something, I suppose the war</seg><seg type="columnLine">is good enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the Viz. Lewis Sherlock was interest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and I vote him first. I confess, though,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I know little of the physical sciences. I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">know enough to comprehend what Sherlock is</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking about, but as for discussing his hypothe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sis, I'm afraid it's beyond me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Howard G. Allen will have to wait quite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while before he sees Mason's Viz supplement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">About all Mason can accomplish on that devil's</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine of his is using an enormous amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy and ink, besides getting drunk on all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beer he consumes. Furthermore, he has a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of magazines to publish (most of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">being published for the members of the Gilded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gremlin Press), and very little time in which to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplish it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maybe I owe Mason an apology. I also get</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk on his beer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I agree with papa Innman on a lot of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">points he made. However, I still believe--and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of argument can change my mind--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">for sheer educational and instructive value--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm not talking through my hat--any of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">works termed "classics" beats any stf hero a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile. In the actual writing and mechanics of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the novels and essays, I am inclined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">agree with Innman. Poe is certainly a better</seg><seg type="columnLine">writer than Kipling in forcefulness and direct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of expression. But is that really the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant side of the matter? Is a story about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bogey-man of more worth than Twain's (also</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fantasy, by the way) A Connecticut Yankee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which tells forcefully of the social and political</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions in England at a certain time in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">history? Weigh each one carefully; in that light</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can't see how you can fail to agree with me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lionel. In the mechanics of writing and/or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">technics, you are right in some cases. But in</seg><seg type="columnLine">actual worth? Never! A true classic, even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fantastic ones of Shakespeare which you men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned, have a direct or indirect relationship with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the solid, concrete things that make up our lives.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But a true fantasy? Conceivably, but of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible use could the story The New Adam be</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me? The idea behind the story is possible, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not probable. Therefore, any use I could gain</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it is, to repeat, possible, but extremely im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">probable. Except, as I mentioned before, when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pertaining to the science of writing. I hope I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">proven my point. I could go on for pages and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pages on all the fine points raised, but I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that what I've said will suffice to convey my</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the way, I vote Innman second place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because although I'm forced to disagree with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he very ably stated his argument. In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll admit he had me pretty well stumped until</seg><seg type="columnLine">I figured just why I thought that Kipling was</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than Poe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I guess that just about closes my letter. Besides</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a pat on the back to Gardner Fox, who, it seems,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is going to turn out to be another Van Vogt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                      Yours,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Al Weinstein.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OH!

Why is it that in every issue</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is someone in the Vizigraph who has to</seg><seg type="columnLine">disagree with me on my most fanatic-minded sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects: Ray Cummings, the type of letter in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Viz. and the cover. In the past, and in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, I have retained some vestige of respect</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fondness for Ray Karden. Just look in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back issues, and you'll find it proven. But now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">opens up on the covers, saying the latest one</seg><seg type="columnLine">was N. G., and one of the reasons was because</seg><seg type="columnLine">it followed the old pattern. I should like to ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a very mild and controlled tone of voice, "Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">what in H- is the matter with that old pat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tern on man, woman, and BEM?" Any cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">must more or less follow a pattern, of a space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, triangle, etc. The triangle pattern must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be pleasing to a good many people. Of the thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands who buy the mag, there must be a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">share who either like this cover, or at least don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">care enough to say anything about it. I for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">like it. I can see where others would not like it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I also have an idea that a good many who do</seg><seg type="columnLine">write in about it, just write to have something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">beef about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now to bring the tears to the eyes of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">issue's authors. To McDowell, for his Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Green Blight, I can give nothing but praise. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">likewise to Fox' for Man-nth. Both of them tie</seg><seg type="columnLine">for first place, by far the best stories in the issue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I liked Man a little bit better, although I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you why. Adams and Steel Giants of Chaos</seg><seg type="columnLine">runs a close second. It really should have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved for first place in another issue, or are all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the issues henceforth to be as good as this one</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. I hope so. Rocklynne's Diversifal, and Wal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's Ultimate World are next, ties. Both rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappointed me, not because they were not ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellent stories, but because of the way they ended.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not a happy ending which is the usual thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Because of this difference, they were more in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teresting than they probably would have been.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sternig's Venusian Invader takes last place, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is still nothing to be ashamed of. In many other</seg><seg type="columnLine">issues the story would have been well up on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">list, but when the other blood and thunder stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so much better, it didn't stand a chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have a word of comfort and pity for Shaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his dangerous bug-eyed monster. It is this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In that dim future of which he sneaks, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a revolt among the bug-eyed monsters. They be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to think that occasionally they should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed to keep the heroines, without the boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends_ butting in. The rest of the BEMs prompt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly decided that rather than let such a horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing happen they would ban themselves from</seg><seg type="columnLine">covers. That is why the thing which visited you</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisted that you should write in favor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monsters. If enough people want them, in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, they can have their women, and stay on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">covers. Also, another word of comfort to Shaw:</seg><seg type="columnLine">if your friend gets too menacing, mix yourself</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bromo, and take a cold shower. It usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">works.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oh, by the way, if any of you intelligent fans</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at the first part of this masterpiece, you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice that I am in favor_ of the Triangle. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for this, you see, is that if people want</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Triangle, they will keep us normal BEMs</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the cover, and at the same time will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">their women protected by the hero. If, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shaw, they write only for the BEMs, they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose their hero, and also the women.
