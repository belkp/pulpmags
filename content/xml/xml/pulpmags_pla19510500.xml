But it's nothing we</seg><seg type="columnLine">need to know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not that bad," Peer agreed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the guy who opens that wall-safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">had better be an armaments expert! Which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're not. But now, crew-member Peer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we want to get Santis' cargo cached on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Old Nameless before I fall asleep, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to get started.

"Tsk, tsk! That always makes yon</seg><seg type="columnLine">so grouchy."</seg><seg type="columnLine">CAPTIVES OF THE THIEVE-STAR	11</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half an hour later, they were on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">way--Channok in the Rar-Twelve, Peer in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Asteroid, keeping as close to each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">as two ships in flight could safely get.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the red glare of the Old Nameless</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun a trifle off-center before him, Chan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nok settled down in the most comfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot-seat he'd ever found on any ship and</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided he could relax a trifle. Peer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">obviously having a wonderful time doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">her first solo-piloting job on a ship of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asteroid's size; and since she'd run and</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed the Asteroid any number of times</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his supervision, he wasn't worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her ability to handle it However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he continued to check in on her over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">communicators every five minutes or so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grinned at the brisk, spacemanlike re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plies he got in return. Crew-member Peer</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on her best behavior right now!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By and by, then--he couldn't have said</seg><seg type="columnLine">just when it started--Channok began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize that some very odd things were</seg><seg type="columnLine">happening around him--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT APPEARED that the Thing he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">put out for burial in a space-crate</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't like the idea of being left alone. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was following him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Channok decided uneasily that it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be best to ignore it. But it kept coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer and closer until, finally, the crate</seg><seg type="columnLine">was floating just outside the Ra-Twelve's</seg><seg type="columnLine">control room port, spinning slowly like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">running-down top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crate stayed shut, but he knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thing inside it was watching him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's my ship," the Thing remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Channok ignored it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you're all alone," said the Thing-.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I'm not!" said Channok. "Peer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Peer's gone back to Santis," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thing. "You're all alone! Except," it ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ded, "for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, good-by!" Channok said firmly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no point in getting too chum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">my with it. He punched the Ra-Twelve's</seg><seg type="columnLine">drives down as far as they would go, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crate vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How that ship could travel! Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hope to keep up with him now--</seg><seg type="columnLine">except, perhaps, that round, red glare of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">light just behind the Ra-Twelve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was actually overtaking him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast. It was coming up like a cosmic police-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, with a huge, hollow noise rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it. Channok listened apprehensive-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. Suddenly, there were words:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "WHOO-WHOOOl" it howled. "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the Space Ghost I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shot up out of his chair like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jabbed cat, knocking it over, and glared</seg><seg type="columnLine">around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ra-Twelve*s control room lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly lit and silent behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ha-ha!"

"That woke you up, I bet!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was that you that fell over?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aw-awk!" breathed Channok. Articu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation came back to him. "All right, crew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member Peer! Just wait till we get to Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nameless! I'll fix you good!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shall I tell you the story now about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Horror Ship from Mizar?" Peer in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired intrepidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go right ahead," Channok challenged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">righting his chair and settling back into it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You can't scare me with that sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff!" He began checking their position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He must have been asleep for quite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while! The Nameless System was less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hours ahead now. He switched on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front screen; and the sun swam up like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big, glowing coal before him. He began</seg><seg type="columnLine">checking for the seventh planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," he reminded the communicator</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly, "you were going to tell me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">story."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The communicator remained silent a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't think I will, anyway," Peer said</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, rather quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not?"

Channok said heartily. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can see the Asteroid right over there on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen 1 You can see me, can't you ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sure," said Peer. "That's a long way</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, though. You couldn't do anything!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's not safe for two ships to travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">much closer together," Channok reminded</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. "We're only two hours from Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nameless right now--I'm already focussed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've been focussed on it for an hour,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Peer. "While you were snoring," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">added. "Two hours is an awful long time!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tell you what," suggested Channok.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll race you to it.

"I can see the old Mound in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain! In the evening strip, Channy--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight-up cliff!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He set the Ra-Tzvelve down first, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the base of a mountain that reared up</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost vertically for eighteen thousand feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so out of a flat, dimly-lit stretch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocky desert land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Asteroid came down in a very neat</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing, two hundred yards away. He got</seg><seg type="columnLine">there on the run, just as the front lock</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened. Peer came tumbling out of it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms and hung on fiercely, while her</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper hugged her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let that scare be a lesson to you!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked when he set her down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It certainly will," said Peer, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutching his arm as they started over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ra-Twelve. "That old Space Ghost</seg><seg type="columnLine">had me going!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Me, too," he confessed; "just for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, anyway! Well, let's get busy."</seg><seg type="columnLine">They went over the Ra-Twelve again</seg><seg type="columnLine">from bow to stern, to make sure there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing they would want to take along</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately, and found there wasn't. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the unopened wall-safe a last calculat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing regard, and decided once more that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'd better not. Then they shut off every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, closed the front lock behind them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and safetied it with the dock bolts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The plain was darkening when they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, but the top of the mountain still</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed with red light. They climbed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Asteroid, and Channok closed the lock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He started for the control desk then; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peer beat him to it and anchored herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the seat of command with hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees and feet. It became apparent almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once that he couldn't get her out of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">without running the risk of pulling off her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now look here, crew-member Peer,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said persuasively, "you know good and</seg><seg type="columnLine">well that if these top-heavy cargo crates</seg><seg type="columnLine">have one weakness, it's the take-off!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It could be the pilot, too," Peer said</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaningly. "I've been studying the manual,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I've watched you do it. It's my turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He considered her thoughtfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Suppose you die of old age, all of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden?" argued Peer. "Wouldn't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to sit here alone without knowing even</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to take her off, would you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That did it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go ahead," said Channok with dignity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking a position back of the chair. "Go</seg><seg type="columnLine">right ahead! This decrepit old man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-eight is going to stand right here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and laugh himself sick!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll be sick, all right," promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peer. "But it won't be from laughing! I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">read that chapter out of the manual to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you sometime."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She liad studied it, too, he decided. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat perched forward on the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, alert and cocky, and went through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the starting operations without hitch or</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitation. The Asteroid rumbled beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, briefly building up power . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">Channok braced himself--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR THE NEXT few seconds, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question seemed to be whether they'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">pile into the plain or the mountain first;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, for another improbable moment, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">CAPTIVES OF THE TMFVrSTAR	13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were distinctly skidding along upside down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Peer got them straightened out, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they soared up rapidly into the night sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">above Old Nameless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Channok's hair settled slowly back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peer looked around at him, puzzled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather pale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's not the way it said in the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ual!" she stated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Channok whooped. Then he sat down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor, bent over and yelled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he got around to wiping the tears</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his eyes, Peer was looking down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him disgustedly from the control chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It wasn't the way it said in the manu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">al!" she repeated firmly. "We're going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to have this old crate overhauled be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore she'll be safe to fly--and if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">weren't my husband, I'd really let you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have it now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood up, muttering some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">apology.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've done some just as bad!" he as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sured her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hum!" said Peer coldly, studying Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nameless in the screen below them. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed safe to pat her on the head then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he kept his hand well out of biting</seg><seg type="columnLine">range.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'd better get back to that moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain and bury the Ra-Twelve before it gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">too dark to find the spot," he suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's still just in sight," said Peer. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the guns ready, and I'll run us past</seg><seg type="columnLine">it slowly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spaceships being what they were, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't much ceremony about caching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ra-Twelve. Channok got the bow-turret</seg><seg type="columnLine">out; and as Peer ran the Asteroid slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the mountainside a few hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the Ra-Twelve, he cut a jagged line</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the rock with the gun's twin beams. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">few dozen tons of rock came thundering</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on the Ra-Twelve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They came back from the other side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little higher up, and he loosened it some</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. This time, it looked as if a sizable</seg><seg type="columnLine">section of the mountain were descending;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when the dust had settled the Ra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twelve was fifty feet under a sloping pile</seg><seg type="columnLine">of very natural-looking debris. To get her</seg><seg type="columnLine">out again, they'd only have to cut a path</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to her lock and start her drives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She'd come out of the stuff then, like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trout breaking water . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Satisfied, they went off and got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asteroid on an orbit around Old Nameless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rot too far out. Peer had assured Channok</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Santis' investigations had proved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet safe for human beings, so it prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably was. But he knew he'd feel more</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable if they put in their sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periods outside its atmosphere. Bathed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dismal light of its giant sun, OI d</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nameless looked like a desolate backyard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Hell. It was rocky, sandy, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">waterless and lifeless and splotched with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale stretches of dry salt seas. Incon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gruously delicate auroras went crawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">about its poles, like lopsided haloes cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cling a squat, brooding demon. It wasn't,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Channok decided, the kind of planet he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have stopped at of his own accord,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for any purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CLIFF against which they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried the Ra-Twelve was the loft-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iest section of an almost unbroken chain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mountains, surrounding the roughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular hundred-mile plain, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">littered with beds of boulders and sand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills, like a moon crater. What Peer had</seg><seg type="columnLine">referred to as the "Mound" lay approx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">imately at the center of the plain. It turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, next morning, to be a heavily weath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered, dome-shaped structure half a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">high and five miles across, which gave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression that all but the top tenth of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant's skull had been buried in the sand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dented here and there with massive ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mers, and sprinkled thickly with rock dust.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was obviously an artifact--constructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hundred-foot bricks! As the Asteroid</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted down closer to it, Channok became</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who built it?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peer shrugged. She didn't know. "Santis</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent a few hours jetting around the edges</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it once," she said. "But he wouldn't tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">us much; and, afterwards, he wouldn't let</seg><seg type="columnLine">us get nearer than a mile to it. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">go back himself, either--said it was dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerous to get too close!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It didn't look dangerous. But fifty thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand years ago, it might have been a for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tress of some sort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You oughtn't to be flying so low over</seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it, even!" Peer said warningly. "Right in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle on top is where it's the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous, Santis said!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Channok didn't argue the matter--they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to get Santis' special cargo cached</seg><seg type="columnLine">and off their hands first, anyway. He lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Asteroid a mile or so and then brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">her down a couple of miles beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mound, at the point Peer had designated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They got out of the ship and gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the broken, rocky plain. The red</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of the Nameless Sun was spilling</seg><seg type="columnLine">across it in what passed for morning on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this world. In it, the black mountain chains</seg><seg type="columnLine">rearing about the horizon and the craggy</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves of flat land had the general effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a bomb-shattered and slowly burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. Far off to their left, he could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper half of the towering precipice which</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked the Ra-Twelve's resting-place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long a time did you say you spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">here?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peer reflected. "About two Terra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">months, I guess. I'm not sure, though. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a long time ago. My youngest brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dobby wasn't bom yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook his head.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">what looked like an inextricable tangle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms and legs, Peer and Nasal-voice were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliding and scuffling down the steep side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rock together. Nasal-voice was try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to hang on to the rock, but Peer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging on to him and jerking like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooked fish whenever he got a momentary</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked down and saw Channok, put</seg><seg type="columnLine">her boots into the small of Nasal-voice's</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, pushed off and landed two yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Channok on hands and feet.

But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't mean much to call you a Canadian</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more, does it?

The smaller satellites had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been largely ignored.

Up went the insulated, airtight</seg><seg type="columnLine">domes, out came the colonists, down went</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mine shafts. -</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a hard life. Crystalline rock was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut by machines at the mine-faces, and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time other machines had brought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the shafts to the surface-level in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">domes, it had become amorphous and</seg><seg type="columnLine">powdery, its crystalline structure destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by being heated to twenty degrees below</seg><seg type="columnLine">zero Centigrade. When you repaired ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chinery below the surface, you wore sixty</seg><seg type="columnLine">kilograms of spacesuit (Earth weight),and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a failure of any item of equipment or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumble by any member of your crew might</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean sudden death. The walls of the dome</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut you in from the sky, for the vacuum</seg><seg type="columnLine">out there was death too; when you did get</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the observatory to see the sky, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Jupiter, weirdly streaked with bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant color--if your dome was on the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Callisto toward Jupiter. Otherwise, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked across twenty million kilometers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacuum to the nearest star.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a hard life, and no life for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lone wolf. There were no homestead farms</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be settled by lonely pioneer families.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Callisto was a sterile place, and to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">life going there at all men had to work to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether. Cooperation was a lesson Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization had learned only after thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands of years of oppression and war; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesson that had to be learned before men</seg><seg type="columnLine">could cross space; and a lesson that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very difficult to forget on Callisto. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">least for most people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rita and Cliff Belden had control of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade between Callisto and the inner plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ets. It didn't start as control, though; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way it began was this: Once the colony</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been well established, its operation</seg><seg type="columnLine">was left completely up to the Callistans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">w*ho shipped as much of their goods to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth as they could manage, and requis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itioned as much food and supplies from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth as they needed--which was really</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best way. The inner planets could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">very well take part in the planning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Callisto's activities, since there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio contact and the trip took over two</seg><seg type="columnLine">months by freighter even when the rela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive positions of the planets in their or-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bits was most favorable. One freighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuttled back and forth between No. 2</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dome on Callisto at one end and any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">several inner-pianet ports at the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rita and Cliff Belden were the two CalHs-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tans whose job it was to run that freighter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little colony was absolutely de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendent on the supplies they brought. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact was obvious to everybody, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beldens made a deduction from it which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unprecedented on Callisto: they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">threaten to withhold the supplies and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thereby force the rest of the colonists to</seg><seg type="columnLine">agree to whatever they asked--provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could make the threat stick. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the attempt. On one of their trips</seg><seg type="columnLine">back from Earth, they put the ship into</seg><seg type="columnLine">an orbit around Callisto instead of land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and announced they would not land</seg><seg type="columnLine">until their henchmen on Callisto were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">control.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the henchmen did a thorough job</seg><seg type="columnLine">of taking control. All the details were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken care of: They quickly seized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio transmitters that maintained con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tact with Ganymede, they confiscated all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reserves of spaceship fuel they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">find, they clamped down as tightly as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could on communiation between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">domes; then they started keeping a close</seg><seg type="columnLine">check on every tool that could be used as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a weapon. There was just one place they</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped up. Their search for fuel wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">good enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The people of No. 4 Dome pooled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuel they had hidden from the Beldens;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they seized from the Beldens* guards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dome's tiny spaceship, which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">assembled .&gt;n Callisto and which had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been intended to leave the Jupiter sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem ; and they sent the ship off for Venus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Garcia and Birkerod aboard. Venus</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the only possible destination, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planets' positions in their orbits as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were then: to reach Earth or Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have taken either more fuel than</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had, or much more time than they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could spare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it was, the trip took eight months.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On Venus there was no hitch.

A moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, the red signal light had flashed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the calculator set in the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulkhead.

When Arne and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I left Callisto, the Beldens learned our</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbit and high-tailed in to the inner plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ets. With plenty of fuel, they arrived be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore us, and got you, their agent, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">job. You got yourself included in our re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn trip on the Tang. Then you calculated</seg><seg type="columnLine">an orbit for us that would run us smack</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Earth at a relative velocity of thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd kilometers a second!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The next thing was to divert the fuel</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Tang's tanks to the lifeboat's,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and take off yourself in the lifeboat.

"Look, Nick, the Beldens have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no chance of winning on Callisto. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance. Men had to learn to cooperate be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore they could get to the planets at all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and by this time they've learned good and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly. The individual who's out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself is an anachronism. You and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beldens--a hundred years ago you'd have</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt right at home.

The inner planets won't in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terfere.

There was a hand reac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion motor the size of a Stillson wrench,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ten containers of fuel, each the size</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a fountain pen. There was a large mir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror, for signaling. Also for the same pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose, there was a powerful, highly direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional searchlight. He checked the cells</seg><seg type="columnLine">which powered it; they were low, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew they were charging at that moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the sunlight falling on them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">searchlight would work. For what that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was worth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So much for his suit. Next, where was</seg><seg type="columnLine">he? His position couldn't be given in lati-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude and longitude, because there wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything for it to be latitude and longi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude on. He was somewhere between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbits of Venus and Earth. The direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Sun he could tell by glancing at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm of his spacesuit and seeing where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sunlight fell--the Sun was behind him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to the right, and a little "downward."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for the Earth, that would be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next brightest body in his sky. He craned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head in all directions, searching. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took out the hand reaction motor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a blast to start himself spinning, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could search in the directions he hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">been able to see in before. Even the short</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast he used made the motor tug at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and started the universe whirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him frighteningly. He turned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">control on the motor down as low as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would go, then pressed the button several</seg><seg type="columnLine">more times. Finally he had canceled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of his rotation, and the Milky Way</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wheeling calmly about him. He got</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself oriented again and after a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time had identified Earth, which was close</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to appear as a blue-green disk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EARTH! A thought suddenly struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The Tang-had been heading</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight for Earth when it had let him off;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was still going exactly in the Tang's</seg><seg type="columnLine">former orbit. He would reach Earth!</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was one more thing he should</seg><seg type="columnLine">check--yes, he had a parachute. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the back of his spacesuit, underneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gear he'd investigated before. Now if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could land safely he was all set! Birke-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rod and Garcia must not have thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One thing still bothered him: He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been headed for Earth when he was put</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the Tang, but had anything happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">since to put him off course? How about</seg><seg type="columnLine">those times he'd used the reaction motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">to set himself spinning? Well, the sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral small blasts would probably not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">had any net effect on his direction of mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and if they had there wasn't any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to be done about it. But the single</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong blast at the beginning--he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember which constellation he'd been</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing at the time, where he'd held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaction motor, and how strong a blast</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd given. That meant he could give an</seg><seg type="columnLine">approximately equal blast now in the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite direction. This he did, being care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful to aim directly away from his center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gravity, so as not to start spinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he should be back on course, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">figured. Assuming, that is, that he'd ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">been off. The small thrust of his reaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor, applied for such a short time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">might not be enough to make any appre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciable difference as to where he ended up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He didn't bother trying to calculate it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing to do now but wait. He spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time thinking about what he'd do</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he got to Earth. It was hard to fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure. He'd had a racket on Earth for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">year-and-a-half after the Beldens brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">him there; everyone had assumed he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing something important to Callisto's</seg><seg type="columnLine">welfare, and all he'd had to do was go</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the motions. Now, he didn't know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was probably true that the Beldens</seg><seg type="columnLine">were through; with the Tang Chuh-Chih</seg><seg type="columnLine">arriving on Callisto, the odds were against</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He'd have to find something else, Pap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">30	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pas decided. This whole Belden business</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pretty provincial, anyway. And as for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Birkerod, Garcia, and those people--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pappas dismissed Callisto from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts completely. There would have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be some angle on the inner planets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After several hours of thought on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject, he took stock of his situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. The disk of Earth was a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger, he thought, but not enough so</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd notice it. He pulled the semi-opaque</seg><seg type="columnLine">visor over his faceplate and went to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">E SLEPT for ten days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Not Earth days, however. When Pap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pas went to sleep the Sun was behind him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He thought he had eliminated his rota-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, but actually he was tumbling head</seg><seg type="columnLine">over heels, extremely slowly. Thus, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, the Sun rose between his feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">set directly "above" him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The eleventh of these "sunrises" woke</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He stayed awake, because as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he flipped his visor up and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him the Earth caught his eye. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was much closer. He did not know how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure its angular diameter, so he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't calculate his distance from it even</seg><seg type="columnLine">approximately, but it looked enormous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How long had his nap lasted? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">spacesuit's chronometer was running. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute hand indicated 37; its hour hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">15; its day hand, 3. That would have told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him how long he'd slept, if he'd read the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chronometer before he went to sleep; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hadn't. All he knew was that he'd slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">much longer than he'd expected, and long</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to get painfully stiff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In any case, he'd covered a lot of dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance. As much as the Tang would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered in the same time, he realized. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was approaching Earth pretty fast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too fast," he added aloud, nervously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'd have to decelerate before he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">there or the parachute wouldn't do him any</seg><seg type="columnLine">good. Now, was it time yet to start decel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erating? If he directed the hand reaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor in the wrong direction now, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">it cause him to miss Earth? He guessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">not: the planet looked so close, any small</seg><seg type="columnLine">"sidewise" push he gave himself could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly hurt. Once he killed his speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth's gravitational field would gather</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pappas took out the reaction motor. Us-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing low power, he turned himself till he</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced Earth, The planet seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">swelled just in the time since he'd waked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. He set the reaction motor to full pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er, grasped it with both hands, held it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of his chest, and pointed it straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Earth. Then he pressed the button and</seg><seg type="columnLine">held it down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The force of the hand jet pushed in at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his midriff, made his legs and head swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward. Well, that was okay as long as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they didn't get into the exhaust. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped blasting a moment to get a better</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip on the reaction motor, then fired con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuously. Occasionally he would find he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">started himself spinning; then he'd shift</seg><seg type="columnLine">the motor just a trifle to keep himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing the planet. He kept the button firm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly pressed down, and the cylinder in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands sent a continuous jet of intense blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Earth. When the first fuel cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge was exhausted, he put in the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond and kept it up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twice he stopped for a food pellet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little water. The rests were welcome:</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms and chest were stiff and aching.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he didn't rest long, because he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting really scared now. He was sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was dangerously close to his destina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and his speed hadn't been cut enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The continents and oceans of Earth's day</seg><seg type="columnLine">side were clearly visible, and grew notice-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably larger as he looked at them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He now thought of the direction he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going as down; he thought of himself as</seg><seg type="columnLine">jailing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something bothered him: America had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been in sight a while ago, but now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see a corner of Brazil appearing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the disk of Earth. Did that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean he was passing by Earth instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling straight at it? No, he realized in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment, it just meant Earth was rotat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; for he could see that the sunset line,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line between night side and day side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not changed its apparent position on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No, he was still falling. And he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling too fast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A suspicion began to form that Birkerod</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Garcia had anticipated this. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">BUND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, terrifyingly, he thought of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garcia's last remark might have meant!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, they'd said there was a way he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could save himself. And the only way he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could think of was to break his fall. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a certain quantity of fuel to do it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with, and he was using it. He was using</seg><seg type="columnLine">it for all it was worth, no matter how</seg><seg type="columnLine">much his body ached with fatigue. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">those two on the Tang had figured this</seg><seg type="columnLine">all out ahead of time, then they must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have left him enough fuel to avoid being</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed. Otherwise they might as well have</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot him on the Tang. Okay, if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough fuel he'd use it all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE AFTER ANOTHER the fuel</seg><seg type="columnLine">cartridges burned out Pappas longed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for another rest, but he didn't dare take</seg><seg type="columnLine">one now. He kept firing, and still the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth kept growing larger and brighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">below him. Finally, there was no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a short breather, Pappas took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaction motor, detached it from the cord</seg><seg type="columnLine">which bound it to his spacesuit, and flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">it downward with all his strength. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did the same with the mirror, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">searchlight, and the reel of cable. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all he could do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then there was an instant when he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had gone wrong. He had not had</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough fuel to do what he'd tried to do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was clear by one look at Earth's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLAY.	31</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">face, which still grew alarmingly fast be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low him; and he could probably have fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ured it out before. But there had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way which would have given him some</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance. He should have used his fuel, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a hopeless attempt to decelerate, but in</seg><seg type="columnLine">deflecting himself so he would miss Earth!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would have passed by Earth, relatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">close. He'd have passed fast, but not too</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast to signal with his mirror to Earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">several satellites, natural and artificial. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">spaceports on those satellites kept twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">four-hour watches for signals of distress;</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they saw a faint blinking light they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would send out a ship which would try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to locate its source. They were good at it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, and if he'd kept his mirror spinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might have picked him up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he hadn't thought of it. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never occurred to him that even when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was alone, as thoroughly alone as anyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">can ever be, his life could depend on doz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ens of other people. He'd thought only</seg><seg type="columnLine">of reaching safety by himself. And, see-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing only the one possibility, he'd played it</seg><seg type="columnLine">blindly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was that instant of sickening real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ization, then a little later came an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Earth ballooned out grotesquely be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low him, suddenly filling most of his field</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vision, and he saw lakes, islands, des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erts. He felt all over him an abrupt, final</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash of heat, and Nick Pappas became a</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DARK NEBULA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By</seg><seg type="columnLine">MILTON L.

We will attempt to reach Terra</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">base before being cut off by the enemy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fleet. However, just in case, we will be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ready. Battle stations!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NEXT FEW HOURS were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hectic ones, especially for the few</seg><seg type="columnLine">seasoned officers aboard the battleship</seg><seg type="columnLine">Albion. The Albion was a fairly new</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. She was fast, heavily armored, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried the latest guns, three facts which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harrigan hoped would save them from</seg><seg type="columnLine">disaster. He realized that HQ had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to break radio silence to notify them of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sudden outbreak of hostilities, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">also knew that the enemy had undoubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly intercepted the message, plotted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Albion course, and sent a half-dozen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fastest ships in hot pursuit. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way the Dark Nebula League liked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight: six to one. Harrigan figured that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he just might be able to outrun them;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but if the League ships did manage to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut them off from Terra . . . well, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hated the idea of fighting that bunch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut-throats with a crew of green kids.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ordinarily, new spacemen were distribu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted among crews of seasoned men at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratio of about one in ten. To be in top</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting condition, the Albion should carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">four thousand regulars and four hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">greenies. There were five thousand men</seg><seg type="columnLine">on board; one hundred and fifty old line</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers, fifty newly commissioned officers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forty-eight hundred Terran young-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sters fresh out of ground school.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The officers had done their best to whip</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the crew into the semblance of a fighting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unit. If a fracas did develop, they might</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">squeeze through if the kids could follow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">orders. But in battle things happened al-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">most too fast to be covered by orders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A man had to think for himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Harrigan found himself staring through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the forward screen, wishing that three or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">four thousand hardened space-Marines</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would suddenly materialize out of thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">OUT OF THE DARK NEBULA	35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">air. O'Brien came steaming up.

Think we ought to prowl?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Guess so. We're going to watch things</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty damned close till we hit base. Bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter check the gun-banks. And by the way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike, who had the controls when that</seg><seg type="columnLine">order came in?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Young chap named McDaniels."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And his navigator?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rose.

Let's have a look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">those banks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ALBION'S eight gun-banks span-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled the ship from nose to tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">like stripes on a watermelon. Each bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">was divided into A, B and C sections, fore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aft and center. Forty-eight men and two</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers manned each section. The atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannon in the nose were fired only by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship's Master gunner, a sardonic ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pert named Irvington.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At number six gun-bank, Harrigan and</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Brien entered section C hatch. O'-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brien's mouth fell open. Along the cat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk behind the gun emplacements proper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">men lounged and leaned. One slept. Sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral were smoking and most of them had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown back their helmets. Of the forty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight, three had their eyes on the finder</seg><seg type="columnLine">screens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Attention," Harrigan roared, and fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">men jerked erect like puppets on a string.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Get your helmets up and your eyes on</seg><seg type="columnLine">those screens. And keep them there until</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're ordered off. This isn't a shake-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down any longer; this is war!" He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to O'Brien. "Who's in charge here?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lieutenant Sanderson."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leave the Ensign in charge and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sanderson report to the bridge at once."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harrigan stooped through the hatch.

Damned if</seg><seg type="columnLine">J'H see a repeat of this!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir," Mike answered, and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the nervous lieutenant. "Report</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the bridge, Mister, and prepare to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">chewed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Sanderson managed a weak "Yes, sir."</seg><seg type="columnLine">* * *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harrigan was pacing the bridge when</seg><seg type="columnLine">McDaniels and Rose came in, stood at</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention and saluted crisply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The admiral returned the salute.

Where is the Commander now ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">McDaniels, short and pudgy, answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">proudly.

But, in Terran com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany, most Ziths acquire the nervous habit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of continually running their hands over</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hair, to make sure that the antennae</seg><seg type="columnLine">are well hidden."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But a lot of Terrans have the habit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smoothing down their hair," Rose ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected.

The chemical make-up</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Zith body is such that water reacts</seg><seg type="columnLine">violently on contact with it, producing</seg><seg type="columnLine">what corresponds to severe bums, usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">resulting in death. The admiral and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">both noticed Sanderson's nervous habit</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in the gun bank a while ago. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitcher incident a few minutes ago proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us that Sanderson was not a Terran.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You men noticed how he shook and paled</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the water splashed near him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then this isn't Sanderson at all?"

"These boys are tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathic over short distances--the antennae</seg><seg type="columnLine">have something to do with that.

Or at least half the enemy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir," Rose responded, "but what</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the Xantus, sir? I--we've never</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen one of them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The admiral shuddered inwardly. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope you never do," he confessed. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wretched memories of two galactic</seg><seg type="columnLine">campaigns swept over him again. "A</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xantu looks like nothing more nor less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a beer barrel on skids, with a cauli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flower for a head. Eight independently</seg><seg type="columnLine">focussing eyes, one for each of the tenta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cles that sprout from the middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest. Get one of those monkies behind a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun bank and you'll swear you have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">platoon facing you." Harrigan lit a cig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arette, forked smoke from his nostrils.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Xantus don't do too much of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">actual fighting, though. Back in the early</seg><seg type="columnLine">days of space conquest, they teamed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Ziths ... I imagine because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xantus have a terrific technical culture</seg><seg type="columnLine">but are few in number, relatively speaking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Ziths aren't great on technology</seg><seg type="columnLine">but have the manpower. And too, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">home systems are only a few light-years</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart. So far, the partnership has worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out very well for the Dark Nebula League;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Xantus providing the brains, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ziths the muscle. They are both ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">races, and very probably their plans for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conquest of this end of the Universe</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have gone nicely if they hadn't run</seg><seg type="columnLine">up against the Solar Federation, led by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Terra.

While he slept, O'Brien, Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scott and his men rounded up four more</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zith spies who were immediately executed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unceremoniously dumped into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket chambers. On the double-check, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifth was discovered cowering in the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain's life boat and he soon followed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brothers. The great ship plowed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ink of space, and the only sounds were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the muffled throbbing from the rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks, the steady hum of the chronometer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the clicking of the audio relay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At 0500 hours the alarm gong clanged</seg><seg type="columnLine">raucously. Harrigan was struggling into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his trousers as O'Brien stuck his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the door and shouted, "Jack!

At 0300 hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the sixth day, Antares shone like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great red eye and they were three hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of base.

The Albion quickly overtook the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two remaining ships and gun-banks three,</seg><seg type="columnLine">four and five riddled one of them.

Now it was the Albion's turn to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spin end for end. But as the Xantu craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">spun into his sights for a fraction of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second, Irvington tripped the atomic can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">non again.

Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing- terrible was going on in Dale Stev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enson's mind, and the turmoil there made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Bryd most uncomfortable. It shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the lethargy of its long sleep. It knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinctively that Dale Stevenson was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to get in trouble and make his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsuitable for the Bryd's occupancy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Bryd sighed. These humans were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">so unstable, so impulsive. The Bryd took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a look around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They -- Dale Stevenson and he -- were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not on Earth. They seemed to be in space</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere, 5,100 miles from Earth. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, so men finally were breaking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shackles of gravitation. The Bryd became</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little more interested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Dale Stevenson was reaching for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">button that would fire a rocket to position</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mirror and bum a path across the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">55</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Being immortal, the Bryd was a very wise and</seg><seg type="columnLine">resourceful Thing--but even so, the problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">of saving Dale Stephenson was a dilly. So much</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to be done in one-fourth of a second!</seg><seg type="columnLine">56	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">biggest city in Europe. Hey! what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on here, anyway ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Bryd had about a quarter of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second to do a lot of research. What was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dale Stevenson doing up here? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he done with himself in the twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">four years since the Bryd had curled up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the boy's cozy four-year-old mind and</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled down for a long nap?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Bryd could have stayed Dale's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand for a while, but the Bryd very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed in minding its own business. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't like to interfere with humans; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was policy. So it decided to get busy. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a quarter of a second to find out things</seg><seg type="columnLine">and decide what, if anything, to do about</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Certainly it couldn't expect to stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortably in a mind as upset as Dale</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stevenson's ... so it got busy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FIRST THING to do was get</seg><seg type="columnLine">oriented. The Bryd took a quick look</seg><seg type="columnLine">around. Dale Stevenson, doctor of phy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sics, was in charge of this sun-station,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was a man-made island in space,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some three miles in diameter. The rim of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island was composed mainly of a steel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">framework like the rim of a wheel, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">little cabins at various intervals to house</seg><seg type="columnLine">a power plant, various controls, rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">berths, repair shops, and living quarters</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the sun-station's crew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The center area of the sun-station was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a giant mirror, three miles across, made up</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thin sheets of metallic sodium fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a skeleton of wire nets. The sodium was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very light in weight, and being in airless</seg><seg type="columnLine">and heatless space, was inert. Also it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">highly reflective.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole business was kept at a point</seg><seg type="columnLine">approximately 5,100 miles from Earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Earth's gravitational attraction ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached neutrality and where the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-station could be maintained in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">given position or moved at will with a min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">imum expenditure of energy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Technically the station was owned by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Night Sun, Inc., along with nearly a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred others around Earth, and this par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular station, No. 18, was under con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tract to furnish illumination at night over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paris, France, by staying out of Earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow and reflecting sunlight on Paris</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Management of such a station involved</seg><seg type="columnLine">many mathematical factors in distance, tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">angulation with Paris, velocity and angula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and control of the curve of the mir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror. Normally this was a parabolic curve,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was constantly varied with other</seg><seg type="columnLine">factors to produce the desired degree of</seg><seg type="columnLine">illumination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No. 18 was under the sole control of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dale Stevenson, who had been psych-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested and certified by the United Nations</seg><seg type="columnLine">licensing board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That made the Bryd feel a little better.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It looked as if he had made a mistake</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-four years ago, but it also looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if the licensing board had been fooled</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the last year, for Dale certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">was getting ready to cause a lot of trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Paris. He could actuate the controls to</seg><seg type="columnLine">expand or contract the rim of the station</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thus vary the focal length of the so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dium lens, and if he should actually con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrate the sun's rays in a small area, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could draw a flaming path of ruin through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of Paris.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reluctantly the Bryd checked again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that that was exactly what Dale</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stevenson was about to do. The Bryd won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered why. It groaned. Humans were al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways up to something. Why couldn't they</seg><seg type="columnLine">relax so the Bryd could rest?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Bryd had been so happy back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">2250--or let's see, was it up in 2250?</seg><seg type="columnLine">(This was 2045.) That was when Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">What's-his-name and that cute girl had</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed on Pluto and given him a chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away. The long, lonely eons in Pluto's</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolute zero had been quite monotonous</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Bryd, which was nothing but pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy but which certainly had its feelings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After almost a third of a billion years ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooned on Pluto it had sometimes almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished it had not been so adventurous in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its youth and hopped that stray comet as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had swept by its home on Arcturus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For it had tired of the comet and jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">off on Pluto, and then had discovered it</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't have enough range of its own to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get from Pluto to another planet. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was that Bob and Alys had come along</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their 'round-the-system honeymoon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Bryd had hitched a ride to Earth (un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to them), for it was pretty darned</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonesome by that time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BKYD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It lived very happily with them until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they got old, and then it decided to go back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time to 1950. There it found a nice</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly mind in Joe Talbott, and after it</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved Joe from blowing up the Lithium</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mountain and half the earth with it, it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">had settled down to snooze in Joe's mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hadn't awakened until Joe died of old</seg><seg type="columnLine">age. Then the Bryd had hunted a nice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stable mind and had finally picked Dale</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stevenson, who was four years old, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had curled up for another long, quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">snooze. But now it was only twenty-four</seg><seg type="columnLine">years later and Dale was in a bother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BRYD went deeper into Dale's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind to see what was going on. Dale</seg><seg type="columnLine">was worried about something. In fact, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had worried so much it had upset his normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental balance. It seemed to have started</seg><seg type="columnLine">back about twenty years ago, a few years</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the Bryd had entered Dale's mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed that Dale's parents had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed in an atomic blowup, and Dale,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight years old, had been taken care of</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his older sister.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you worry, Dale," she had told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him stoutly. "I'll take good care of you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I'll buy your clothes and your school-</seg><seg type="columnLine">books and everything. You won't have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to a home. I won't let them take you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That's what Dale had been scared of</seg><seg type="columnLine">--going to a home. He was happy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marillyn. She took good care of him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow managed to keep the authorities</seg><seg type="columnLine">from finding out that a thirteen-year-old</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl was supporting a small boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dale had understood all those things</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, when he started to the university</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they became curious about his back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. He realized then what she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll remember all those things," he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her in the first fullness of young matur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity and his sudden realization of her loy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alty. "You've practically devoted your life</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. I appreciate it. You'll see/' he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">embarrassed in this new knowledge, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">humbly grateful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He got a chance to show her; for six</seg><seg type="columnLine">months after his graduation, while he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being trained at Station No. 18, he in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted that she should come to visit his</seg><seg type="columnLine">new post. Marillyn never had ridden a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket because she was afraid of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but she recognized the honor he was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferring on her, for very few persons but</seg><seg type="columnLine">employees had ever set foot on a sun-sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. She agreed to go. Dale arranged pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage. Then she was severely injured in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">take-off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dale was devastated. He called in spe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cialists, consultants, diagnosticians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't worry about it," he said. "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">take care of everything. You'll be all right</seg><seg type="columnLine">in no time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she wasn't. She was badly crippled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralyzed from the waist down, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">became pitifully thin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dale spent most of his salary on her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctors told him it was useless, nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">could help, that a part of her brain cells</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been destroyed and could not be re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">built, that she might live fifty years but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she would always be helpless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dale refused to believe it. "She's got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get well," he said. "It isn't right--after all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the things she did for me. When she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a kid and should have been skating</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dancing and going with boys, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">working to keep me from going to a home.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She's entitled to some fun now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she didn't have a chance.

Dale was filled with unexpected jeal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ousy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a restless night he had just about</seg><seg type="columnLine">rationalized the entire situation. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scene in the garden did not necessarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean anything. He would phone Ann,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mention last night, and of course she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would explain. Then he picked up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning telepaper from London and read</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the gossip column that Ann Wondra,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Polish beauty, might soon announce</seg><seg type="columnLine">her engagement to Georges Raoul Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mont, son of the French ambassador.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dale was stricken--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And was still in that state of mind, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bryd saw, when a man came to his hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">room that afternoon. "You are in charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sun-station No. 18, over Paris, I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was very interesting to the Bryd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because it saw that the man was cleverly</seg><seg type="columnLine">masked with a plastiform shell that did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not at all appear to be a mask.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," Dale said glumly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAN'S EYES looked specula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive. He glanced at the telepaper on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dale's bed, and the Bryd, figuratively</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking--for of course the Byrd was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but pure energy--opened its eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the Bryd knew the man's thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was astonished to learn that Dale had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been closely watched for some time. Fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing the scene in the flower garden, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">item in the telepaper had been esperially</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged to produce a certain reaction in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dale Stevenson without Ann Wondra's</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know, of course," the man said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that France is about to disturb world peace</seg><seg type="columnLine">by invading Spain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dale sat up and frowned. "No, I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is true," the man said, watching him</seg><seg type="columnLine">intently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why are you telling me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man cleared his throat significantly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You might be in a position to save the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world from an atomic war."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dale stiffened. "You must know," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said coldly, "what my position is. I am in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the employ of the United Nations, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">any attempt to control my actions is coer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cion and the penalty is death."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man did not back away. He moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer, and his eyes became black points</seg><seg type="columnLine">of force. The Bryd saw that the man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental powers unusual for that period of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth's history.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look at me, Dale Stevenson."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dale fought against it, but the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">will was powerful. Dale's resistance weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened. The man's eyes never wavered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dale's. He moved still closer and spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a low tone. "Our information is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">France will drop atomic bombs on Spain's</seg><seg type="columnLine">principal cities at three a. m. one week</seg><seg type="columnLine">from today. Suppose--just suppose--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">some other nation--some nation powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to do so--should be in a position</seg><seg type="columnLine">to warn France at two-thirty that France</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be permitted to attack. Suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">this warning were backed up with a show</seg><seg type="columnLine">of force to prove the warning meant busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Isn't that the job of the U. N. ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man's face was only inches now</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Dale's. The Bryd shivered in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">figurative boots. This man was a master</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypnotist. Only they wouldn't call him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypnotist in these days. They'd call him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">psyche-man. Psyche-control was much</seg><seg type="columnLine">more powerful than hypnosis. Psyche-con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol touched the moral inhibitions, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypnosis never had been able to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dale was lost. In the end he agreed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a cash-on-delivery fee of one hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars, to concentrate his sodi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">60</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">um mirror beam on Paris at two-thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the morning designated, and thereby,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a smoking path of fire and ruin, help</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other nation to warn France that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">must keep hands off Spain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps Dale's jealously of Georges</seg><seg type="columnLine">Raoul Dumont had a bearing on the agree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DALE HAD BEEN so much under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foreign agent's influence that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not considered the ethics of the idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all until time to press the button that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would concentrate the sun-energy into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">consuming column of fire. The time was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now . . . and it was only now, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypnosis just beginning to wear off at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edges, that he found himself wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaguely about angles of the situation that</seg><seg type="columnLine">previously had not occurred to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Who was the man who had talked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him? Whom did he represent? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't he gone to the U. N. if he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But then it was true, as the man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said--if France planned to start dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic bombs at three o'clock, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be too late to appeal to the U. N. Dale</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't like Frenchmen anyway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Altogether, the Bryd concluded, Dale</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stevenson was pretty muddled up in liifi</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. The man needed a rest, but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be worked out later. Right now his</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger was on the firing-button, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">psyche-control, though weakened, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushing him to finish the job.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oh dear, these humans certainly could</seg><seg type="columnLine">muddle things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Bryd decided to have a look at Ann</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wondra's mind. And there it got some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what startled, for Ann's, which previously</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been all warm and cozy as toast, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very low indeed. She was looking at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapshot of Dale, and it wasn't even a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very good picture, but it exhilarated her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at the same time it depressed her, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause she wanted Dale but couldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ann was sitting cross-legged on a thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">rug, drinking Darjeeling tea, and talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her mother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm glad M. Dumont has gone back</seg><seg type="columnLine">home," she said, and the Bryd noted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there wasn't any jump in her blood-pres-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sure when she mentioned Georges' name-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, not much, anyway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's very handsome," said her mother,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knitting busily. The old lady's blood-pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure jumped more than Ann's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But he isn't as nice as Dale Steven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My sakes, Ann, I hope you don't grow</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be an old maid, mooning over that</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue-tied--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mother!" Ann got to her feet. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was long-legged and clean-limbed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bryd approved of her. It could imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">by now what she had done to Dale's mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It didn't see how it had slept through it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the Bryd took a quick transition</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to America and had a look at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind of the doctor who took care of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marillyn Stevenson. The physician was</seg><seg type="columnLine">having lunch with a consultation expert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know," the doctor said, fingering</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Manhattan--"I don't know what to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">about young Dale Stevenson. He's still</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to cure his sister."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe there's a reason."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure there's a reason. He has this</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of gratitude and loyalty and all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's all there is to it, but he's butting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head against the infinite inertia. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">spending two thousand a month on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl--and the worst of it is, she doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want him to. She knows what the score</seg><seg type="columnLine">is and she's resigned to it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, loyalty is a wonderful thing, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I suppose it can go too far, and over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow reason, especially in the young. Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there any chance at all for the girl?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No possibility. Progressive degenera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the brain tissue." He tossed off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Manhattan and the Bryd shuddered</seg><seg type="columnLine">--it preferred Martinis, itself. "The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing would be a miracle, and you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how scarce they are in the medical world."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He smiled. They both smiled. The Bryd</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentally snorted. Who were they, to laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">at miracles ? They thought they were pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">damn* smart, didn't they?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Bryd decided it had better look in</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Marillyn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT FOUND HER in a glassed-in porch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sanatorium, with her reclining</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair facing south, and the sun pouring</seg><seg type="columnLine">down through the magnolias. The Bryd</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BRYD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">61</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">liked this. Every tiling was restful and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaceful and pleasant--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But something was wrong as hell in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marillyn's mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had a small bottle of something in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand under the light blanket, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lying back running over everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her mind. Dale loved Ann and Ann</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved Dale. But they couldn't get married</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of Dale's exaggerated sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marillyn didn't want to keep them apart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She could adjust herself to a very pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">life in a place like this, but Dale wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">let her. As fast as he could save some</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, he'd dream up some new scheme</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get her cured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, Marillyn reasoned, she wasn't of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any use to anyliody. Why should she stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Dale's way? The Bryd was puzzled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What did she think she could do?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had the little bottle under die blan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ket, she was thinking. A few drops of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that and--the Bryd was positively flabber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasted. The girl was getting ready to kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself. The Bryd probed into her mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an instant and discovered that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't being a martyr and had no com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plexes; she was just trying to straighten</seg><seg type="columnLine">things out for Dale and Ann.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oh, beans, thought the Bryd. If hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mans weren't the dumbest beings ever! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched Marillyn raise the bottle to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips. It simultaneously took the form of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nurse, standing there at Marillyn's side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Marillyn gasped and said, "Oh, nurse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I didn't know you were there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am," said the Bryd in its best con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tralto voice. "Did you wish something,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hand with the botde of poison fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">back under the blanket. "No, I didn't call."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "May I move your chair out of the sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It isn't in the sun," Marillyn said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Bryd raised its eyebrows. It did</seg><seg type="columnLine">some quick work on the wind, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the sun, shining steadily through an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening in the magnolia trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps it is too bright," said Marillyn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If you'd just move it over there--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Bryd was delighted. In the process</seg><seg type="columnLine">of moving the chair, it got its figurative</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands on the bottle and disintegrated it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAVE A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bug</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO COMPLETE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DETECTIVE BOOKS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--the magazine that gives yon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOT JUST ONE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the recent best-sellers In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery Held</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT TWO!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Endless delightful, spine-chilling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">excitement by the best mystery</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">writers of today -- whose books,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">separately, wonld cost yon 92.00</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">each • • •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A FOUR-DOLLAR VALUE</seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO CO M PL ETE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DETECTIVE BOOKS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR TWENTY-FIVE CENTS</seg><seg type="columnLine">AT YOUR NEWSSTAND</seg><seg type="columnLine">62	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then it said, "Miss, don't you think you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will get well?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marillyn said calmly, resignedly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's no chance.

Maybe the Bryd was</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting peevish in its old age, but why</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't people mind their own business</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a change?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It resolved itself into a doctor, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gratified to watch the head nurse's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes shoot open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Madam," the Bryd said in its best</seg><seg type="columnLine">baritone, "were you addressing me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--" The head nurse swallowed. "No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir, I--I beg your pardon, sir." She re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered slightly. "Have I seen you be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OH, BOTHER! Details, details! Hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mans wouldn't be happy if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">weren't tied up in details all the time. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bryd dematerialized and went inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanatorium by the simple process of flow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through the spaces around the nuclei</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the atoms in the wall. Then, on second</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, it went back and erased some mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ories from the mind of the head nurse;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then it took Marillyn through the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the sanatorium. It went into her mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and did some repair work that would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazed the finest brain surgeons on Earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a few months Marillyn's paralysis</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be gone and she would be well and</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy.

Dale Stevenson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger was just starting to move the but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton. There was maybe a fiftieth of a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Bryd carefully implanted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of Marillyn's cure in a comer</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Dale's brain and sat back to await re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sults. But in the next hundredth of a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond there was no response. Dale still was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to turn the sun on Paris.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the Bryd, now thoroughly disgusted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">implanted the knowledge of Ann's love</seg><seg type="columnLine">in another corner of Dale's mind and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its astonishment had to jump fast to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get out of the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Did that ever get results!

Then the Bryd climbed into its fav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orite cozy spot in Dale's mind. The &gt; spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still wann and snuggly. It began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">settle down -- but then it remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">something.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It got up. It went back to Earth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunted up the minds of the men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were flying atom-bombs over France. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bryd knew by now, of course, that France</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself had never had any atom-bombs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Bryd went into the minds of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreign fliers and sent them back to drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atom-bombs on their own cities. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, they had those bombs and they ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently were the kind who wouldn't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied until they could drop them.

They were men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideals and, more than that, of action.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somewhere in the desert below Syrtis had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the Arrow's headquarters. All the</seg><seg type="columnLine">punitive expeditions of the Rockheads had</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to find him. No one had known who</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was.

But he had been more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">night raider--he'd been a symbol to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people in the Rockhead yoke that some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one was actively on their side. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tremendous lift in spirit each tima the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arrow hit a Rockhead target, and for days</seg><seg type="columnLine">thereafter people in the community where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had struck--and in others, too--</seg><seg type="columnLine">were more cocky and less cooperative than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Rockheads thought they had a right</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be. The Arrow's raids sparked slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down movements and some sabotage and</seg><seg type="columnLine">evoked Rockhead reprisals, against guilty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and innocent alike. Some of the reprisals</seg><seg type="columnLine">were cruel--so cruel that they would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">deterred a less determined man--but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Green Arrow was not to be swayed.

It was a masterpiece,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scott had to admit--but a masterpiece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">striped-pants double-cross. On the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand the Earthmen pumped up the egos</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Rockheads, and on the other they</seg><seg type="columnLine">smuggled the democratic leader s-- those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who still lived--out of their desert Siber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ias and let them talk to the people in</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of small indoor gatherings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The people anywhere--whether it's in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Iopa or Middletown--are smart if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the facts.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was close, and there was some violence</seg><seg type="columnLine">when W.G. watchers arrested repeaters</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Rockheads' machine, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dictatorship went down in a relatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaceful manner.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">big, grinning masks of Earth women were</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving chaotically, idiotically, all around</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Spotlights which were partly heat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamps played over the threng in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">many colors, coloring and wanning the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">night scene. Musicians in outlandish cos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumes circulated in groups of three or</seg><seg type="columnLine">four, their reedy tunes conflicting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet mingling in a pleasing semi-harmony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Most of the crowds were Martians, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there a party of Earth people</seg><seg type="columnLine">was taking part in the gaiety. In the warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow of one big spotlight, an Earthman</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dancing with a Martian girl, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mask and his fantastic steps parodying a</seg><seg type="columnLine">popular Terrestrial ballroom team.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly there was an intrusion into</seg><seg type="columnLine">this scene of celebration. From a side street</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the main square which Scott and Ylia</seg><seg type="columnLine">were now going through there came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">knot of people. They came on slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a dozen of them, their steady prog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ress in contrast to the aimless, carefree</seg><seg type="columnLine">motions of the rest. Their faces were seri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous, and the group held both Martians</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Earthmen. They were young-old faces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">young in age but old in their apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">contempt for the scene all round them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The group remained close together, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">costumed, and when a reveler pulled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sleeve of one in invitation to join a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chain dance, he was pushed away brusque-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, almost angrily. When the group reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">a well-lighted position near the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the square, its members formed them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves into a tight circle. They pulled signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">from beneath their tunics and thrust them</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, then began moving in a shuffling lock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">step, chanting discordantly. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pickets--serious, almost fanatic young men</seg><seg type="columnLine">of two planets, bound together in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause. Their signs read: "Down with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth Imperialists," "Democracy, Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mockery," "What are you Celebrating--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colonization ?" and so on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They chanted the same things, out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">unison, so that their voices created a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve-tingling atmosphere of unrest. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted defiantly, yet not looking any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where but at the neck of the man directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead in the revolving picket line. "Reds</seg><seg type="columnLine">Picket Landing Day Fete," Scott said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, thinking in headline terms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was tension now among the cele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brants in this part of the square. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a time for problems, or for thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about them, and those who had gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have fun were being robbed of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">spree.</seg><seg type="columnLine">74	PLAJVET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly a Martian stepped up and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quick motion wrested a sign from one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pickets. He ripped it up and danced</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the pieces. The picket whose sign had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been snatched made no protest, aside from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a look of surprise and a frown. He stayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ranks, and the circle continued to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cheers went up and other revelers</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed forward. The marchers tightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ranks and took firmer grips on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs. The Martian who had snatched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first was now conferring with others. Be</seg><seg type="columnLine">motioned to a group of silently-standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">musicians, and they took up a tune. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">music was rousing and patriotic, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some costumed Martians went into a wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake dance. With apparent good humor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but with telling effect, they drove into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle of pickets and split them into two</seg><seg type="columnLine">groups. In the scramble, several more</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs were trampled underfoot. More rev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">elers joined the attack and the pickets</seg><seg type="columnLine">were split again, until they were widely</seg><seg type="columnLine">separated and all their signs were gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their unity lost, they disappeared in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The musicians switched to a gayer tune</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there were cheers and laughter. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian who had grabbed down the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign was hoisted into the air, where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed his over sized head, grinning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The interruption of the fun was ended,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and without violence. Scott and Ylia moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT SCOTT knew the picketing had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been only one manifestation of a smol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering problem. There was truth in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs, and the people knew it. They just</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't wanted to be reminded of it now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, besides, most of them didn't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">their thinking done for them by the left-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wingers, who proclaimed the right of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people but too often in history had aborted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very rights they spoke of so feelingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The limited democracy the people now</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoyed had been hard-won. It was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect, they knew, and they suspected</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was corruption here and there,,</seg><seg type="columnLine">either in their own government or in W.G.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the Martian people had had a belly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful of violence.

He was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. But Scott was aware that Murain</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself was too trusting. The Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">president was a grateful man, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratitude had made him less suspicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a politician should be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Where the Rockheads had driven hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">bargains with Earth, Murain's represen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tatives drove none at all. They trusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">their deliverers--the men of W.G.--to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right thing. And the Earthmen, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, were doing the right thing--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">for themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Where the Martian democratic govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment had once lost to the fascists through</seg><seg type="columnLine">force, it was now losing to friends who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rooking it, in a perfectly legitimate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">businesslike way. The Commission on Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploration and Assessment had now become</seg><seg type="columnLine">known off the record as A. &amp; E.--assess-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and exploitation.

Appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently it was a concession he felt it nec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">essary to make--a sort of horse trade with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some powerful leader in Parliament to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get an administration bill through. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scott knew, now that he remembered, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Rastol was a Rockhead. Not an overt</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, true. There was no blood on his hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as anyone could prove. But Rastol</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a power in the totalitarian gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment lately voted out. Possiblv Murain</seg><seg type="columnLine">could find no one else for the job. Rastol</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ability, of course, but he also had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinge, if not a definite odor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had been brought to trial, under a</seg><seg type="columnLine">W.G. indictment, but had been acquitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">of complicity in any of the really unsavory</seg><seg type="columnLine">doings of the Rockhead regime. Some had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said it was lack of evidence, but news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men covering the trial had a strong sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picion that several prosecution witnesses</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been given bank accounts. And Ras-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tol went free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now Murain was offering him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big commerce job--one that held the purse</seg><seg type="columnLine">strings of a fair share of the Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">budget. The post would give Rastol the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power to spend, to let contracts, to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">loans and parcel out a tremendous amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">of business. That money could go to help</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the economy of Mars back on its feet, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">it could be pork-barreled into the coffers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of firms whose ties with the Rockheads</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been only nominally broken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rastol's acceptance of the job, not yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">forthcoming, and his confirmation in it</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Parliament, would be a kick in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth to Martian democracy. The reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this off-in-the-corner Landing Day</seg><seg type="columnLine">soiree became a little clearer -- although</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scott still was unable to figure out why</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd been invited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scott shook the hand Rastol extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said something noncommittal. Most</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians looked almost alike to Earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, except for their sex differences, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rastol was distinctive. He was corpulent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing most Martians were not, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hairless, which also was unusual. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin was whiter than that of most of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetmen, and he had no neck to speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">of. If Scott had been a caricaturist, he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">have drawn Rastol as an egg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ylia had left the room. She came back</seg><seg type="columnLine">now with a tray, and served drinks. Scott</seg><seg type="columnLine">took one of the small pottery cups and</seg><seg type="columnLine">told himself he mustn't drink more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of them. They contained a syrupy</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue liquid with the kick of a rocket-ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kring raised his cup. "To the Repub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lic," he said. They all sipped their drinks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've asked you here," Kring said, "for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a purpose. I should not have chosen Land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Day if it had not been important. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you have very generously broken other</seg><seg type="columnLine">engagements or left your work--" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed to Scott--"to be here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rastol spoke in a low, resonant voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is an honor to be asked to your home,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Kring."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The "mister" was something Earthmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought. Mars, before the Rockheads</seg><seg type="columnLine">set up their semi-feudal system, had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no such term of address.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kring bowed again. "I am especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy that you were able to come, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rastol, because what I have to say should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be of particular interest to you." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to Toby Black. "You, Mr. Black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are interested in construction, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mr. Warren's news service has an</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest in something similar--reconstruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">76</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. So we are well met."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scott didn't know what this preamble</seg><seg type="columnLine">was leading to, but he wished Kring would</seg><seg type="columnLine">get on with it. He did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Warren," Kring went on, "may</seg><seg type="columnLine">also have a news story of some value.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You see, before Mr. Rastol leaves this</seg><seg type="columnLine">room tonight, he will have announced that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he cannot accept the post of minister of</seg><seg type="columnLine">commerce in the Murain government."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOL DIDN'T MOVE, except for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a narrowing of his eyes. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, carefully: "Indeed ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kring smiled a little. "Yes," he said. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think Mr. Rastol will find that his private</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs are of such a demanding nature that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he will be forced regretfully to decline the</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor tendered by President Murain."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rastol said evenly: "I hesitate to differ</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my gracious host, but it would seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me that an individual might be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered to know his own affairs better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than another."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am sure," said Kring, "that no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows your affairs better than you, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rastol."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scott looked at Toby Black, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned forward in his chair as if trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the significance of it all. Scott knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Toby knew as much about Rastol as</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone, and probably more. Toby was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of half a dozen men who were permitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ride the private elevator to the private</seg><seg type="columnLine">office of the director-general of World</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rastol looked at a timepiece on the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rose from his chair. "I am afraid I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must say good night. I had hoped to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">better company, but I have just remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered an appointment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Please sit down, Mr. Rastol," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kring. "We have much more to discuss."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rastol moved toward the door. Ylia</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped in front of it. She had a Q-gun in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am quite proud of my daughter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">marksmanship," said Kring. "She is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal of any soldier at hitting a target. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">short range she never misses by so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a hair."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rastol sat down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sipped his drink and appeared to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">relax. "Be good enough to tell me," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "why you think I would be so lack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in a sense of public duty as to reject an</seg><seg type="columnLine">assignment to which my government has</seg><seg type="columnLine">called me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The answer is simple," said Kring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Murain government is not your gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment. Your allegiance is to the totali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarian movement."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think the public record will show the</seg><seg type="columnLine">falsehood of that statement," said Rastol.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The trial to which I was so cruelly sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected proved just the opposite. You will</seg><seg type="columnLine">recall that the verdict was one of ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quittal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only," said Kring, "because some wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesses were bribed--and others were mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rastol smiled thinly. "Your proof?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kring smiled also. "Of that? None, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit. But we have proof of other things</seg><seg type="columnLine">--things without value in a court of law,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, but which may persuade you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">retire to private life, for your tranquillity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Produce them," said Rastol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a cool one, Scott had to admit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the newsman realized that Kring was</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Warren," he said, "if you will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">so kind." And he held out his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scott gave him the papers he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought from the office. He had no idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">what bearing they had on the situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">now being unfolded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kring broke the seal on the envelope</seg><seg type="columnLine">and opened it. He looked through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">news reports--those which had been used</seg><seg type="columnLine">and those which hadn't. Finally he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he was looking for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have heard of the Green Arrow,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kring asked Rastol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course. A bandit and outlaw who</seg><seg type="columnLine">achieved some notoriety. What of him?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You may not have heard," said Kring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that his real name became known. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself and some others who cared to ask,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after it was no longer a guarded secret.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His name was Acton. ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kring looked closely at Rastol. The big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian gave no flicker of recognition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A not uncommon name," said Rastol.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Acton was the name of your son, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">DATELINE: MARS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was silence in the room. Kring's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fcyes looked steadily into Rastol's. Ylia</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood at the door, her gun no longer point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the guest, but down at her side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toby Black was stopped with a cigarette</seg><seg type="columnLine">halfway to his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scott raised a hand to brush away what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought might be an insect on the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his neck. There was nothing there; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was part of the tension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kring spoke again. "Was not Acton the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of your son, and did he not fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">against you and the things you stood for?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rastol's eyes went from one to another</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the room. He made no other movement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even his breathing was not apparent. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">length he said;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Acton was my son."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">K RING'S BREATH came hard, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been holding it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Rastol added: "But what of that?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Really, gentlemen, this is a most ridicu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lous performance. To bring me to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, to threaten me with weapons and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with words and to produce mysterious pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers with the flourish of a wandering mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic--this is childish. I must ask you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">excuse me. I have an important letter to</seg><seg type="columnLine">write President Murain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What will the letter say?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will say that I accept humbly, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">with pride that I have been chosen, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">position of minister of commerce in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">government to which I owe allegiance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish to serve to the best of my poor abil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Allegiance!" Kring spat the word.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You speak of allegiance, who have never</seg><seg type="columnLine">known it to anything decent and honor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. You blaspheme the memory of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's great deeds when you use the word."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Neither my son nor any creature that</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawls on the ground has any bearing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my decision. Your threats and blackmail</seg><seg type="columnLine">are unworthy of you, Mr. Kring. And if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you persist in this farce, or seek to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">your information publicly, I shall be forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make a noisy and patriotic speech which</seg><seg type="columnLine">will look incongruous in my biography but</seg><seg type="columnLine">which will have the stupid public applaud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the galleries. I shall say that as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an older man I believed in gradual change</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that no man was happier than I when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars became a republic under the aegis</seg><seg type="columnLine">of World Government. I shall say, if I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to, that of course I had publicly</seg><seg type="columnLine">deplored the activities of the man called</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Green Arrow, but that I was in good</seg><seg type="columnLine">company, for did not Mr. Murain--then</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet President Murain of the Republic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-be--also plead for peaceful methods of</seg><seg type="columnLine">achieving freedom, and urge his followers</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shun violence? And if someone is so</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfeeling as to mention that Acton was</seg><seg type="columnLine">my son, could not my impatience with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">activities have been in reality a father's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fears for the life of the boy he had loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the cradle? Oh, I shall make them</seg><seg type="columnLine">weep, Mr Kring, and your petty plan will</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to nothing. Furthermore, I shall de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand your resignation as a sub-commis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sioner of commerce, and I have little doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I shall receive it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are an excellent man with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech," said Kring. "That I admit.

You may or may not</seg><seg type="columnLine">choose to recall--Druro."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rastol chose to say nothing. Druro had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been one of the blackest marks against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rockhead regime. It was the name of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">infamous concentration camp, in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of prisoners had died of malnu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trition and overwork and thousands more</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been put to death because of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">political views.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can tell you something about Druro,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Toby Black. "I was there as a guest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your government--the Rockhead gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment is the one I'm talking about, Ras-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tol, not the one you claim you're sudden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly so fond of."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toby put out his cigarette and leaned for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward.

I'm just a hardheaded old trader</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Earth, and maybe some people think</seg><seg type="columnLine">my language is crude. But I say what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think, and I don't like you and your kind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Usually I don't mix in politics--my busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness is construction. I started when I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">78</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a young squirt and built things with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, and they got calloused. Now I sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a fine office and scoot around in a fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-car, and other men do the dirty work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But that's honest work. The dirty work I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't stomach is your kind, Rastol, and since</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've got the chance to undo some of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or maybe prevent some more of it, I asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kring to let me speak my piece/</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scott could easily have been persuaded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he hadn't known better, that World</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government Investigator Toby Black was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just that rockribbed businessman-with-a-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscience that he was pretending to be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toby went on: "The reason I saw Dru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ro the way mighty few people saw it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that somebody slipped up. Druro was also</seg><seg type="columnLine">a factory town and there was room there</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a new plant. God knows you had enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave labor to make it damned profitable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So I was invited by your Rockheads to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look over parts of the town so my com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany could make a bid on building the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant they wanted. But I saw more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">you fascists intended, Rastol. I'm an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">country boy and I get up early. One day</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	got up earlier than those gorillas who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were supposed to tag around with me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep my nose clean.

I got out and talked to the peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple in town, and the people had plenty to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me about that camp just over the hill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of the people I spoke to had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside it, and they knew what they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking about."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An interesting anecdote, Mr. Black,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rastol interrupted, "but I must confess</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I see no relevance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toby lighted a cigarette and spat out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smoke. "The relevance is coming right</seg><seg type="columnLine">no. I heard a lot of different things about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Druro from a lot of different people, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the things I heard over and over</seg><seg type="columnLine">again was the same. It was the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man whose signature sent those thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands to their death. I don't have to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Rastol, what that name was. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign your letters with it every day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">«Y'0U CAN PROVE nothing,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">X snapped Rastol, his compostire jolt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed for the first time.

"There's no</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof. After I heard of your acquittal I</seg><seg type="columnLine">got good and mad about it, and I made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">special trip to see if I could find some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those people I'd talked to back then--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get affidavits, if they wouldn't testify in</seg><seg type="columnLine">person, to get new evidence. But you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">your Rockheads did a good job, all right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You practically wiped out Druro.

If I were you I should welcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">this opportunity to make some slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">amend.

Thus, since the tone-deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Occidental had not been able to master the</seg><seg type="columnLine">simplicities of Chinese or other Mongo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lian tongues, the Asiatics had taken up</seg><seg type="columnLine">English, with which had been blended</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arabic, Urdu, Malay, and a good deal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Western European; and, while seven cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turies of Venusian isolation had made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech of the people of the Domes diverge</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the original international Terrestrian,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verrill had not too much difficulty in</seg><seg type="columnLine">making himself understood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This black bag," he told a group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the caravan men, "will interest Ardelan</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that's your chief's name, isn't it? Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me go into the mountains with you to talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're crazy," a craggy faced fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">with drooping moustaches and hard blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes told him, levelly. "You think I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Verrill laid out three daggers. He picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">one up, jabbed it into the top of a table</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluttered with heaps of goatskins, dried</seg><seg type="columnLine">apricots, raisins, and bags of coriander</seg><seg type="columnLine">seed. He bent the weapon until the grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the table top. He released it It</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped straight up, with a fine, high</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORMES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pitched spang. He plucked a dagger from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountaineer's belt, drew the other wea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pon from the table, and slashed them edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">to edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He cut shavings from the mountaineer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon. Then he stropped his own blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the palm of his hand for a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strokes, and next ran it along his arm. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">hairs toppled as he cut them free; there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no drag at all, the edge was so keen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mine are not trade daggers," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bet you the three that Ardelan will listen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me, and not throw me out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Terrestrian's eyes gleamed. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do I put up for a bet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A pair of those boots you're wearing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Put my knives in your belt now. If I lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">my bet, they're yours. If I win, you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome to them anyway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the caravan men fitted him out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">garments and boots like their own; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verrill went into the mountains with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE TRAIL SNAKED ALONG</seg><seg type="columnLine">precipices and wound past narrow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden valleys. At the foot of a cliff lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shell of a space-cruiser which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescoped from its original six-hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet to a bare two-hundred, though much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the nose had melted from the impact</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the rocks. Gnarled oaks and juni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers reached up from a riven seam of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell. The metal had not rusted. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely tarnished to a slate gray. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine of such metal as could have furnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">all manner of implements for the Terres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trian s--but they did not know how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploit it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, Verrill was looking down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow, upland meadows where sheep</seg><seg type="columnLine">grazed. There were barley patches. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes felt as though they were full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand. The snow-white glare from cliffs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the dust which rose in yellow puffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">at every step, made the way a torment</seg><seg type="columnLine">for one accustomed to the paradisiacal</seg><seg type="columnLine">clime of the Venusian Domes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each day's march brought the donkey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caravan within sight of alternate trails,</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded by mud-brick towers, where armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were stationed to watch the moves</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hostile neighbors. The return, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">EXILE FROM VENUS	85</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">without pursuit, would be dangerous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last they came to Ardelan's mud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walled houses, huddled on a rocky shelf</seg><seg type="columnLine">which overhung a fertile valley. The settle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment was surrounded by a wall of earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stone, and had escaped contamination</seg><seg type="columnLine">because no one would have bombed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">12,000 foot range of limestone peaks ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept by mistake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the trading convoy filed into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangle of flat-roofed houses which sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded a hard-packed central square, wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, children, and dogs came out, each in</seg><seg type="columnLine">full voice. The procession kept straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">on toward the entrance of a two-storeyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">building. Half the ground-level was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stable; the rest, a courtyard where Arde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lan and a handful of armed companions</seg><seg type="columnLine">lolled under an awning of black goat-hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Terrestrian faces were no novelty to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verrill; but this time, being a stranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them--instead of merely a specta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor seeing a handful of them, half defiant</seg><seg type="columnLine">and half uneasy in the strangeness of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trading-post--he saw what he had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">before noticed. They tended toward height</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ranginess, prominence of nose, angu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larity of face; yet behind this likeness was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shadow-pattern of racial differentiation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were differences of flavor, rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than of outright form. The flare of a nos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tril, the shape of an eye, the fullness or</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinness of lip--a thick necked one, here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there, suggested that, generations back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been among his ancestors a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocky Mongol from Central Asia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guards, instead of presenting Ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rill, explained him as though he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">some trade article. Ardelan, listening, stud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ied his visitor with entire impersonality, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might have scrutinized a basket of fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripe apricots to see how they had endured</seg><seg type="columnLine">being hauled so far.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's in the bag?" he demanded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Medicine. I am a doctor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What for? People die anyway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A doctor," Verrill explained, conceal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his dismay, "is not to keep people from</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying. He is to make it more agreeable</seg><seg type="columnLine">'for them until they finally have to die."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ardelan addressed his henchmen. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">answers summed up to this: that if noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing much ailed a man, he'd get well by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, and if something really incapac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itated him, it would of course be something</seg><seg type="columnLine">so serious that he could not last long at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ardelan digested this wisdom, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, "Verrill, can you make knives like</seg><seg type="columnLine">these you gave that man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am a doctor, not a blacksmith."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can you make guns or cartridges?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can you fight?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Verrill glanced uneasily about, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ardelan might be on the point of select-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing an opponent to test the stranger's</seg><seg type="columnLine">claims. And, having read Verrill's face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ardelan snorted, and not waiting for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply, demanded, "Then what are you good</seg><seg type="columnLine">for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To treat the sick," Verrill repeated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with growing sense of futility. "To bind</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounds. To set broken bones."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look at us. We've done very well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can do better."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Can't work, can't fight! Good for noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing but doctoring. Bad as a priest! Lock</seg><seg type="columnLine">him up; I want to think this over."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The guard hustled Verrill and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">medical case into an empty granary. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">slammed the door and rolled a boulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">against it. It made no difference whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not he could shove the door open;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was nowhere to go if he did get</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. He could not find his way back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trading-post except over the way which</seg><seg type="columnLine">his escort had brought him: a guarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE HALF-GLOOM, Verrill noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the wall had been cracked by</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthquakes. These cracks gave him hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and toe holds, to climb up until he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch the rough-hewn timber which sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported the roof of brush and clay. Lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the crown of the wall, he could look</seg><seg type="columnLine">out through rifts in the roof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Herdsmen were driving their flocks in</seg><seg type="columnLine">from distant slopes. Others drove donkeys</seg><seg type="columnLine">laden with brush. Verrill was appalled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ever present evidence that Terrestrian</seg><seg type="columnLine">life was a matter of digging, scratching,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and enduring the elements. The stark emp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiness of the sky worried him; he was ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">customed to the perpetual twilight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">impenetrable clouds of Venus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">86	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well away from the settlement, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the wall, was a small, squatty cube</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a small tower at each corner. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure was backed up against an over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging cliff, and was unapproachable ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept from the walled town. The precipi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tous ending of the shelf guarded the white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">washed cube more surely than if it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been within the town wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The open doorway was so large in pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion to the structure itself that sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mise made VerriU's pulse hammer. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be the shrine where the Fire of Skan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derbek was kept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toward dusk, drums rumbled and trum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pets of ram's horns bawled hoarsely. Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying tightly bound bundles of brush</seg><seg type="columnLine">marched in procession toward the white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">washed cube, and chanted as they went.</seg><seg type="columnLine">•When they came to the place, they filed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, each coming out with his faggots ablaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They returned to their houses. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, Verrill's captors brought him a bowl</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mutton stew, and leathery cakes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bread. "They couldn't have cooked this</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff so soon," he reasoned. "It must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been cooking all the while, on fires already</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted. That procession was fire worship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat there a long time after he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">licked the gravy from his fingers. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">shocking business: meat so plentiful that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was fed to a prisoner, and yet the bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barians knew nothing at all about cookery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The town swarmed with flies. Vultures</seg><seg type="columnLine">perched on the walls and watch-towers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watting to clean up the garbage and offal</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung from the houses. The community</seg><seg type="columnLine">well had a nasty taint from surface drain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age from the stables. Verrill, after a bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">night's sleep, spent the morning deciding</seg><seg type="columnLine">that when pestilence did break out, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would need his medical supplies for him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The women, shapely and graceful, gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered about the well to fill the earthenware</seg><seg type="columnLine">jugs they carried balanced on their heads.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They chattered mainly about the outsider,</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving most emphasis to his looks, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoting certain speculation to his possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">usefulness, and probable destination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kwangtan," they all agreed, ''wants</seg><seg type="columnLine">him killed or sent away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From what he could piece together from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the various relays of women he overheard,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Verrill concluded that Kwangtan was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper of the shrine; and that medical</seg><seg type="columnLine">practice was the monopoly of old women,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who cooked up herbs. These potions, plus</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kwangtan's incantations, kept the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munity in health.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The drowsy silence of midafternoon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken by an hysterical screeching and</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming. Before Verrill could arouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself from the stupor of half suffoca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, the door was jerked open and sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral men pounced for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You, with the medicine! Work for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Bring the black box!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY HUSTLED HIM to a hous&lt;S</seg><seg type="columnLine">where several old women were shak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and back-slapping a boy of three or</seg><seg type="columnLine">four. The kid's mother, one of the few</seg><seg type="columnLine">redheads in the colony, was wailing at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitch that made Verrill shiver. A beetle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">browed young man with a wiry beard</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatted on the floor, looking helpless. AH</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did was repeat, "Get Kwangtan!" And</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one paid him any heed at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the sight of Verrill, one of the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">women laid the child on a sheepskin</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread on the floor. The child's face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray. His lips were bluish. His eyes bugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. He wheezed agonizingly. It made</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verrill's skin twitch, just to see the littTe</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow's losing battle for breath. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly choking. With all voices suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stilled at Verrill's approach, the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">became all the more ominous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In his utter perplexity and dismay, Ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rill hoped that what he heard was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">death-rattle which would relieve him of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the task about to be forced upon him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">absence of Kwangtan, the holy man, told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the story: that wise fellow was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to lose any prestige by tackling some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing he could not handle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's wrong?" Verrill asked, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a show of assurance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a doctor," the kid's father</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarled. "Do something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He swallowed an apricot seed," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">child's redhaired mother said. "It's stuck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we pan't shake it out, he's choking. Get it</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, you blinking fool!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The kid's father drew and cocked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol. The dry click chilled Verrill to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart He remembered an old story of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">EXILE FROM VENUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">87</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">emergency operation at a trading-post. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">yarn had given the Venusians quite a thrill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ardelan stalked in. He nodded his</seg><seg type="columnLine">approval of the man who had a pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained on the doctor. "Stranger, do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">make any mistakes. Kwangtan has warned</seg><seg type="columnLine">us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Verrill had a raft of Venusian specifics</seg><seg type="columnLine">for just about every known ailment; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had counted, however, on nothing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort which now confronted him--had</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked forward simply to giving the sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages pills, and swabbing them with anti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">septics. As he knelt, he fumbled helpless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly with the instruments in the case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do this right," Ardelan said. "Or he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoots."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Verrill loaded a hypo with a local an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aesthetic. The glint of metal, and the sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den end of the child's gagging as the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jection stilled his struggles, nearly cost Ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rill his life. Ardelan's big hand knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pistol out of line as it blazed, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slug scorched Verrill's cheek and pounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chunk out of the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's not dead," the chief said, "Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A splash of antiseptic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, nerving himself, Verrill made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slit in the throat. There was not much</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood. He got the apricot seed free. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">haggling jabs, he took a coupk of stitches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He taped and bandaged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, shoulders sagging, he settled back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to keep from toppling to the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The kid's lips were no longer bluish.

At last he blinked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried out, and reached for his throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's brought him back to life!" the</seg><seg type="columnLine">redhead cried, and snatched up the boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VERRILL CRUMPLED. He toppled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sprawled. He was, however, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious, and when he heard what the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taineers were saying he realized that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">he done it intentionally, he could not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done better than collapse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One said, "He's left his body for awhile</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight off the devils, so they won't come</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to hurt the kid."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Verrill muttered and mumbled until, sa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tisfied that his act had been up to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectation, he sat up.

His beard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his shoulder-length hair were white.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a moment, Verrill thought that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old fellow was a veteran of The War. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">age made him fantastic in a colony where</seg><seg type="columnLine">men over forty were scarce, and those</seg><seg type="columnLine">over fifty, rarities; though old women</seg><seg type="columnLine">were more than plentiful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Verrill declined the gift of the pistol.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Give it to the holy man," he said. "I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not come here for pay."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he went with Ardelan to sit un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the black awning where the chief set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled disputes, and planned raids on neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boring tribes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Excellency," Verrill pointed out, "hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a pistol at a doctor's head is no way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of making sure he'll help the patient."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are a stranger.

"Your men talk about nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but raids on your neighbors' flocks, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">about feuds. Haven't you enough sheep?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">88	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doctor, you know how to save lives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but you know nothing at all about living."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ardelan pointed toward the gateway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which opened from courtyard to the square.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Half a dozen women, high-breasted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-limbed, were gossiping at the well.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their wild gracefulness was blood-stirring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verrill contrasted them with the studiedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">elegant ladies of Venus, and with Linda</seg><seg type="columnLine">particularly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have enough sheep, and enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">women," the chief explained. "The sheep</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't make trouble. The women do. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">my men are not to cut each other's throats,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they must have outside enemies to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">them busy. Or the jealousies of their wives</seg><seg type="columnLine">would prod them to too much competition</seg><seg type="columnLine">with each other."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thinking back to his quarrel with Gil</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dawson, Verrill had to concede Ardelan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">point and principle. And then he got back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the perils of being a stranger. The fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing day, he proposed, "Let me take</seg><seg type="columnLine">part in the fire ceremony of an evening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In that way, I won't be a stranger so long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chief got up, presently, and clapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands. A retainer came forward with</seg><seg type="columnLine">two horses. They were hammer-headed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaggy, Roman-nosed, and with fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. The saddles were sheep-sldn pads.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were no stirrups.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Verrill said, "Excellency, you ride. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They set out for the shrine. Meanwhile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a dozen horsemen came in from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other end of the shelf. One, overtaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verrill and the chief, slowed down enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to exchange a hail, and then pressed on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before they came to the shrine, the rider</seg><seg type="columnLine">had finished his business with Kwangtan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was leaving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He circled wide, to avoid an encounter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This made Verrill uneasy.

"More trouble!</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's one of the outpost guards.

"Get that fellow out of here! He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to steal the Fire of Skanderbek. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're a fool for allowing him around</seg><seg type="columnLine">here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ardelan endured the cursing until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a chance to ask, "Have you had an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other vision, Holy One?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The man who just rode up told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I had already learned from the fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">gods.

Verrill demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One of your own people who fly down</seg><seg type="columnLine">from heaven. One called Dawson. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trading-post.

He and Ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">delan eyed each other. What unspoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought passed between them was beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verrill's guessing; yet it must have had</seg><seg type="columnLine">force, for Kwangtan offered no objection</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Ardelan said, "Verrill, come in with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and bow to the flame."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE INTERIOR of the shrine was</seg><seg type="columnLine">much larger than the front had sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested. This was because of a grotto in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the overhang of the cliff. From a rift in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the natural shelf of rock came hissing jets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fire. They wavered, varied, blending</seg><seg type="columnLine">into each other and separating again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind the low barrier of flames was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous ruby, uncut, yet a perfect hexa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gonal crystal, with edges clean and sharp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was not from any alluvial deposit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">else the faces would have been dulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the edges chipped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whether or not the stone had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">polished, Verrill could not even surmise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At all events, this was a ruby that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from the original matrix, the rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">birthplace of gems. It collected all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavering light, transformed it, and poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">it back again, transmuted into living red.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crystal seemed to pulsate with a life</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The beauty and the splendor made Ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">EXILE FROM VENUS	89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rill picture the Fire of Skanderbek against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Linda's white skin--and the wonder of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have showed in his face, rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the resolve to have the gem at any cost,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Kwangtan's radiant hostility softened</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceptibly. Verrill imitated Ardelan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture and bow: and the two withdrew</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the shrine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't doubt," said Ardelan, once</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was in the saddle, and Verrill tramp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing alongside, "that you'd steal it if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oould get out of here with it.

But the wind whisks the flames out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then there's nothing but a smell."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verrill had by now revised somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">his notions on savages. "Then why do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">put up with that wild-eyed fanatic?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ardelan smiled indulgently. "You peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple from the outside know many strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. How to come down from the stars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How to make guns. But the few of you</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've talked to are dog-ignorant when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes to people. The fire god is something</seg><seg type="columnLine">our neighbors don't have. It makes us</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick together better, and keeps us from</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting among ourselves. Aren't any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your people smart enough to have gods?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verrill answered, with feigned humility,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I came to teach you people a few things but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seems I can learn something. Then it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be a fair exchange."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day, he had Ardelan send a</seg><seg type="columnLine">courier to the trading-post.

There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">also a letter for Linda, telling of the suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess of his first operation, and of Dawson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">first move to make trouble. "But Gil was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit late" he wrote. "I'd already got in</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty solid. That won't keep him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying something else. He must have talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good deal before he left. If you hear any</seg><seg type="columnLine">gossip as to what he planned to do or how</seg><seg type="columnLine">he intended to do it, be sure and write me</seg><seg type="columnLine">the details. From all I've seen of Terra so</seg><seg type="columnLine">far, they should have bombed it even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than they did.

Whereas in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twentieth century, there had not been more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than two or three specifics, there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">now ten times as many. It was a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of taking the proper bottle, just as, in an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient times, one had reached automatically</seg><seg type="columnLine">for quinine, the primitive specific against</seg><seg type="columnLine">malaria.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile, what had been his prison</seg><seg type="columnLine">became his home and his dispensary. Dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his wait for the shipment from Venus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he instituted a garbage-disposal program.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He condemned the shallow well, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">them build a wooden flume from a spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">high up on the mountainside. Each radi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal move, however, had to wait until a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cure he had effected assured him of suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficient momentary popularity to enable</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to kick an ancient unsanitary practice</seg><seg type="columnLine">overboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then one night came a furtive sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his door, as thoftgh someone were try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to enter by stealth.

Though he doubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed that the fire priest was coming to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose of him, there was all too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance that Kwangtan had convinced one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tribe that carving the stranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">would in the long run be beneficial. De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite the warning, and Verrill's readiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">90</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for whatever might be creeping up, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had his moment of terror.

He had to end the matter by</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocking the other out before he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to grips to make it a finish fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stealthily, he skirted the wall. He heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soft mumble of the leather-hinged</seg><seg type="columnLine">door as it dragged the hard earth. A sliver</seg><seg type="columnLine">of moonlight reached into the darkness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barefooted, Verrill made no sound as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">evaded the widening streak of light. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">patch of shadow broke it. A dark shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">edged into the gloom. Verrill measured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance. He gathered himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had to make sure whether there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only that one, or whether others had</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined. He held his breath until his pulse</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammered in his ears. The motion at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door had stopped. He was afraid to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hale--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then he breathed again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The one who approached had long hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">which mirrored red glints. She had shifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for the moonlight to outline the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve of cheek and throat, and hint at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothness of shoulder and ripeness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast. The arms were white and slender.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her stalking motion was beautiful even</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the obscurity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a whisper of sandals, and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath. She was then of a sudden close</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him, and seemingly not at all sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised. It was as though she had expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to be precisely where they met in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness. He must have dropped the cud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gel, for at the first touch of her, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroking the sleek red hair, and with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other hand tracing the curve of waist and</seg><seg type="columnLine">back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She snuggled closer, and he said, *'Fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lana!" as though touch and taste and smell</seg><seg type="columnLine">had identified the girl as surely as sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was Falana, the aunt of his first pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tient. She wore the shapeless, crude gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of the tribe, yet it was as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were neither homespun nor even a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisp of air between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Falana had no words to waste as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">found his mouth in the darkness. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing to explain. When he stepped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">back and further into the gloom, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">close as ever; and, as if seeing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness, she seemed to know exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he spread his sheepskin mat--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She did know. Or else he must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Falana finally got around to talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with words, she did not tell him how</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had admired him from first sight, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his surgery had been marvelous. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "I'll bring my things over in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning," and yawned contentedly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">snuggled closer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VERRILL spent a restless night, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing intensely occupied in telling him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, over and over again, that Venus was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long way off, and that whatever hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened on Terra did not really count, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less as a result he became embroiled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">feuds on Falana's account and to such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent that he would be unable to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">off with the Fire of Skanderbek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well before dawn, Falana went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door to get a small bundle she had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying at the jamb. Before Verrill knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was happening, he got his first whiff</seg><seg type="columnLine">of breakfast cooked in his own home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eating with neighbors," Falana ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served, "must have been awful.

Whether there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been sufficient to make his bones ra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dioactive until they would glow, either</seg><seg type="columnLine">then or now, was an open question.

The nights were cold, and the trails</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few nights later, Verrill went out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">high on the rimrock, to lurk in a perilous</seg><seg type="columnLine">perch overhanging the shrine. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kwangtan momentarily outlined by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light that came from the grotto. The priest</seg><seg type="columnLine">was making for the spring, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing higher. Apparently he was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">out by a secret way, for a concealed pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose. Well satisfied, Verrill climbed down</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the bitter cold wind which whined</seg><seg type="columnLine">eternally about the limestone buttresses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unobserved, he went down again into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter of the ledge, and to the house where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falana was asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She no more perceived his return than</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had his departure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BEFORE MANY DAYS had passed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verrill was busily probing for bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lets, suturing sword slashes, and setting</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones. When the fighting men he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">salvaged were well enough to be about and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for more trouble, Ardelan con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessed that he had entirely revised his no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions on doctors. And that gave Verrill his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to say, "I'll go along the next time</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's a raid. I could have saved that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who died on the way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ardelan shook his head.

Ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rill said, mockingly. "Living on the fat of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the land, and taking none of the risks."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You've made that for yourself," Arde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lan retorted. "And speaking of priests,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll have one for a patient."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How's that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kwangtan is coughing a lot.

Verrill knew when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to stop pressing a point; and he knew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">also that further words had not been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">needed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In this he was right.

His presence was good for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morale of the raiders. And while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught no sight of Dawson, he won pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tige from supposedly having come to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frontier camps to get a shot at his enemy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Actually, he rather hoped that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have any such chance to settle the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feud ... it would be much more satisfac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory to have Dawson witness his return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus with the Fire of Skanderbek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And of an evening, when he was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">home with Falana, she would sit with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he watched Venus hanging low over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rimrock, white and splendid; she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">finishing her term as evening star. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of that far-off globe made him more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than homesick. It accentuated his feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of remoteness and of exile, and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time made him uneasy and uncom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable, as though he and his Terres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trian redhead were somehow under Linda's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he was afraid lest Falana read his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts. The longer he stayed, the harder</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be to leave; for in spite of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">having come with fraudulent intent, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done enough good to these barbarians</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have become attached to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile, the sooner Venus l&gt;ecame</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning star, the better he would like</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T LAST CAME THE NIGHT</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he felt sure that Kwangtan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">search for the bones of Skanderbek had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become such a fixed habit that the priest</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be ranging further and further afield,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the shrine unguarded for an ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengthening period. The length of Kwang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tan's absence was the measure of Verril's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head-start.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he set out for his goal, he said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, "When the ola devii misses the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruby, and then hears I'm gone, he'll likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">94	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">play foxy and cook up a yam about my</seg><seg type="columnLine">having taken it back to the gods.

I've done a rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonable number of other miracles since I</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought Falana's nephew back from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead ... so if he's smart, he'll invent an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other miracle, and that will make it nice</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Falana. . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so, all at ease, he rode boldly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walled enclosure. The guards, assuming</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was going out on a case, settled back</seg><seg type="columnLine">after greeting him, and drew their sheep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin coats closer about them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nearing the shrine, he left his horse in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadow of a limestone ledge, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceed afoot. He had to make sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kwangtan was actually away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stealthily, he made the most of rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shadows to cover his advance. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gurgling overflow of the spring combined</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the whining of the wind to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtain of sound. He was quite near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot from which, unseen, he could look in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see if Kwangtan was there, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a disturbance which gave him all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer he needed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kwangtan was not abroad, hunting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead man's bones. He was instead choking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasping for breath; in his struggle, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked down some pottery, judging from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clatter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sounds, and the way the old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been scrambling about by night, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploring ravines and caverns, exposing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtaxing himself, told the story. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to the end of his crooked rope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was perfect. It had worked far</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than Verrill had anticipated. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">sit and wait for silence and the finish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But another ingredient took effect. Ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rill's own long-sustained pretense of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">a doctor drove him forward against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">best interest. After two paces taken in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless daze, he was no longer compulsion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven and bewildered; he ran, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his kit. He had brought it with him, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of habit as much as for making a</seg><seg type="columnLine">show for the benefit of whomsoever he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might encounter along the way to the bor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he knelt beside his patient, Verrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">concluded that Kwangtan's heart had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting up tricks; though with exposune</seg><seg type="columnLine">and worry, other complications might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">set in. He got his vials and his hypo and</seg><seg type="columnLine">set to work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of a sudden, he knew that he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone with his patient. Startled, he glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FALANA was in the doorway, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her two of the guards.

He and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kwangtan were supposed to be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk with the gods. That was pure non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense.

He had seen no signal fires on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crests that were dark against the stars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The way became harder, and until moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise, difficult to pick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the first half-glow whitened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">limestone slopes and the high snowcaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountain world became a maze of illu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion and shifting glamour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, Verrill's horse sniffed the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and would have whinnied, had he not</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked him in time. As he paused, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered whether Falana's presence, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night he had saved Kwangtan, would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient precedent for her accompanying</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into the field; or whether instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion would be aroused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had reined in at the edge of a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow.

It collected enough of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow to pulse and flame $s though in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">own right. One good look he got, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had knotted it again into the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her scarf and thrust it securely between</seg><seg type="columnLine">her breasts</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm going with you to the home of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gods," Falana said, "and if they, your</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, don't like me, they can do what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they want with me.

Instead of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrified by a very logical suspicion, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismissed the query: for in either event,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had no longer any choice concerning</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falana. She had made the bond so strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">that wherever he went, he would take her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no more clash between him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dawson. The bond that had attached him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Linda had been cut.

Ten to one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falana had smothered Kwangtan, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of malice, but simply because he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have kept her from following Verrill. Since</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verrill could not reject her, he had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accept the act as his own, however heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the burden.

It seems only fair that some</seg><seg type="columnLine">additional space be granted to a person who</seg><seg type="columnLine">has studied Dianetics under Mr. Hubbard in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Los Angeles school. I attended the first course</seg><seg type="columnLine">in professional auditing in this area, and by dint</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hard work graduated with one of the rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">rare certificates from the Hubbard Dianetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Research Foundation. I mention this so that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be assured that I have some experience in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field, and perhaps investigate some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">following information.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In reference to Mr. Wickham's letter:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1)	If certain things happen consistently, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laws can be formulated or discovered which</seg><seg type="columnLine">adequately explain this consistency, and extra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">polating from these laws new laws can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">postulated which subsequently prove to be valid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where is the tmscience ? The assertion that Ron</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hubbard lias dim awareness of what constitutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">science is your cross to carry, and certainly not</seg><seg type="columnLine">his to disprove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 2)	I have worked about 350 hours with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dianetic processes, and of this time much has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been spent with persons who know nothing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dianetics, or Dianetic terms. Some of these have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been 8 &amp; 9 year old children.

But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">does not admit that they made the discovery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reactive mind as different from the subcon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious in that it contains only data recorded dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing moments of pain and "unconsciousness" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the sole source of aberration in the human</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. He does not admit that others evolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dianetic techniques.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now Mr. Blish:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am truly sorry to hear James Blish say in</seg><seg type="columnLine">CAPITAL LETTERS that only experienced</seg><seg type="columnLine">persons should experiment with Dianetics. I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">agree that only those persons who are well versed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the processes of the field should EXPERI-</seg><seg type="columnLine">MENT, but feel that such a statement is poten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tially misleading to many people. Through my</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience I have found tliat anyone is capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of using Dianetics if he will do three things, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">these are:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1)	Study carefully and thoroly the theories</seg><seg type="columnLine">and techniques as described in the book with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elimination of the one to seven count by merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VIZIGRAPH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">saying-, "Close your eyes/' and avoiding using</seg><seg type="columnLine">random repeater technique.	# &lt;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 2)	Follow the rules closely and not mixing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the techniques with other methods and ideas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 3)	Stick to it, not giving up, for success will</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely come to those who persevere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In conclusion I find the question, "Where is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evidence?" / have evidence, for I have worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Dianetics using the above three rules, Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have evidence?

My subject is the work of Ray</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bradbury. I have been actively collecting Ray's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stories in all fields and publications and have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">talked to him at length on several occasions in his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">studio, so I feel that I may speak with some au-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thority on his work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Let me begin by pointing out that Ray Bradbury</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is a very conscientious craftsman who takes a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">great deal of time on a story--as long as six</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">month: oh a short. And he has been working four</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">years on his major novel which, by the way, is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">semi-fantasy. The fans who have complained of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his repetition in theme have merely to look to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">masters in the arts. Most of the great symphonic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">composers began with a major theme and built</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">variations on that theme in the ensuing move-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ments. In the fields of writing and painting this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">also holds true. All of our modern-day "giants"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have used the same theme time and again, de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">veloping its varied hues and colorations. To ac-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cuse Ray Bradbury of cheap repetition, of "selling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the same story over and over," is extremely stupid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and ill-informed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Since Ray has begun to sell more of his work</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the "slicks" there are those grudging fans who</seg><seg type="columnLine">give vent to their frustrated envy in the form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">petty attacks on Bradbury, written for both pro</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fan zines. They complain that his "science" is</seg><seg type="columnLine">inaccurate, that he dwells morbidly on death and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his conceptions of life are twisted and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torted. Let ns examine these points ...</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Bradbury's science is neither accurate nor in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">accurate--it isn't science at all! He uses other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">worlds as does an actor use a painted stage, tQ</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VtZiGRAPH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">109</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">project his ideas and emotions a bit more purely</seg><seg type="columnLine">and imaginatively than he could do on a realistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">footing. He writes of mood and impressions, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the irony, the humor, the sadness, and the fragility</seg><seg type="columnLine">of human existence ...</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Certainly, he writes of death. It is basic. We are</seg><seg type="columnLine">bom, we eat, we sleep, we live and we die. Death</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerns every living being, human or otherwise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this planet. Why not examine its many-faceted</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and not cringe behind a mask and pretend it</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't there. Bradbury explores death as did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">late Max Brand explore strength in its pure phys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical form. It is his privilege and it is neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">morbid noi distorted. Let the shallow, superficial</seg><seg type="columnLine">fan seek elsewhere if he lacks the literary under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing to appreciate Bradbury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ray pays special care to the harmonious over-all</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect of each story. He wastes no words, building</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ideas and dialogue toward a chosen climax.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each element is taken into account and not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least of these is the title. Ray believes that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">title of a story should not conflict with its content.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He keeps them strong and direct Now in the case</seg><seg type="columnLine">of DEATH WISH his title was THE BLUE</seg><seg type="columnLine">BOTTLE, and DEATH BY RAIN was THE</seg><seg type="columnLine">LONG RAINS.
